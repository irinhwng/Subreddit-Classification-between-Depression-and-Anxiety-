1,depression,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.  

Thanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.  ",Regular Check-In Post,1549392217.0

6,depression,"I'll be 27 in a couple months. I was thinking back to when I was a kid and got sad. I'll never have that naivety and sense of wonder ever again. It left me when I was a teenager and hasn't come back.

I've seen and been through too much, and it turned me into the cold, jaded husk that I am today. I've tried therapy and meds, but I can't seem to regain my enthusiasm for life. It's all so frustrating, boring and painful. Just uninteresting.

Everything feels like a lie. I can't trust anything or anyone. You get shit on by people so many times over the years and it makes you lose faith in humanity. My friend recently sent me a video of a talented guitarist playing a song, and all I could think about is what editing did he use to make it sound better. My immediate assumption, without even realizing it, was that his talent was a lie. I couldn't just enjoy the song for what it was.

So this is who I am now. As a person. As hard as I try to make good memories, the bad ones and the hard lessons learned are still there. How can you ever be happy knowing the world and people in general don't give a flying shit about you? Knowing that people will smile and lie to your face?

The answer is, you won't. You know what the world is now. You can't go back. This place just sucks for some of us, and no amount of therapy or medication can take that realization away. It's a dog eat dog world, and those of us not built for it will suffer. It's just nature.","I think once you reach a certain age, it's too late.",1562158421.0

13,depression,"Just turned 24, trying to get my life in shape. I’ve made some bad decisions in the past, namely dropping out of high school (guidance counselor told me to leave, shouldn’t have listened) and dropping out of college when I found out I was in the wrong program. I wanted to pursue my dream job of working as a game developer. Turns out I was working towards a certificate to do tech support. I’ve had many short lived jobs. Left them all. Finally got a good job working for Samsung. They fired me on week 2 because I got the flu. Tried getting a job at a plant through a temp agency. Passed out from the heat and begged them not to fire me when they found out. Almost passed out again a few days later and walked off the job. I’m so sad. 

I’m living in a camper behind my aunt but she’s psychotic, the other day she locked my girlfriend and I in the back yard and told me I could no longer open the gate because a few months ago I forgot to lock it. That could’ve made my girlfriend late for work. The camper was made in 1995, it’s literally as old as I am, and it’s falling apart and I’m so scared she’s going to make me pay for the damages to it even though I haven’t done anything to cause it. I have however neglected to tell her about the extent of the water damage however (dry rot in walls, sinking ceiling in one room) because, well, I’m scared of her. My mom proposed the idea of her financing a camper to put in her yard that I can live in. But I’m scared of that. My dad still lives there, and he was extremely abusive growing up. I’m scared if I move back with my parents I might get into a hole where it’s hard to leave. I’m scared of what people will think of me. I’m already the black sheep of the family. Both of my sisters are succeeding. One is moved out with a husband and two kids. The other is dating a guy who is working towards working for a certain government agency. I think. I’ve never had a conversation with him. He doesn’t acknowledge me. I know what people think of me but I never wanted this for myself. 

I just want to go back to school but I have no money. I already have a student loan that won’t be paid off for six years. I don’t have a car. I need a car for school. To get a car I need a job that I can keep that won’t cut my hours like a few jobs that I’ve had. What if I get a car then lose my job like every other job I’ve lost? How will I pay for my car?

I have been given a gift

And I have been told I must be thankful

So I stretch my lips into a smile

And show everyone that I am happy.

-

I am not allowed to throw it away

That would be rude, I’m told.

But that’s alright.

I think I’d like to keep it

For a little while longer at least.

-

Maybe someone will take it from me

Or I’ll make a mistake and break it

Maybe by then

I will have learned to truly mourn my loss.

And I suppose

I must also enjoy mine. 

Maybe I simply don’t understand it yet. 

Maybe I’ll learn to love it one day.

This never worked out as I got picked on a lot for being really tall and skinny, Yeah it was probably more banter but I had no confidence at all and was always self critical, sadly I couldn't leave till I was 21, I had smoked weed and started drinking at about 13 and stopped weed by the time I joined the Army but kept drinking, Started taking party drugs (mostly cocaine) as a crutch, when I was drunk I was a different person... a bit more confident and out there. I hated life, I woke up everyday just wishing I was dead until I turned 21 and could leave, it takes about a year to leave so you get out when you're 22, about 6 months before I turned 22 I started taking panic attacks, I never knew what a panic attack was at this point, never really heard of anxiety or mental health, I had felt like this before in my life but I just put it down to drugs or whatever but these panic attacks were bad, Really bad. I went to see someone about it and I know the story has been long so far so I will keep the rest short, after seeing a bunch of therapists and psychiatrists with and outwit the Army, getting put in a mental ward for telling one of them I WANTED to kill myself, not that I was going to, spending 2 months in a general hospital being told its just anxiety when I knew it wasn't when actually it was a bad reaction to sertraline, to having social services phoned on me about my nieces because I told a therapist that I had a thought about how horrible it would be if what happened to me happened to them, for context - my brother can't have kids the natural way because of his illness so he had twin girls through IVF and I love them to bits, they are probably the thing that have kept me alive because he might not be here soon and I wanna be there for them, and I had an intrusive thought about how sick it would be if what happened to me happened to them, I didn't want that thought and I felt sick for having it and when I told my therapist she basically called me a pedophile and phoned social services - So between a bunch of different medications, different therapists on the NHS, going private and spending £3,000 and still not feeling better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone has binned me, My private psychologist said she can't help me anymore unless I get put on medication which she can't prescribe. 

The NHS psychiatrist telling me ""you're 24, meds won't stop the bad thoughts and you feeling the way you do, you need talk therapy but we are discharging you from this mental health clinic""

Finally my GP just upping my meds that help me sleep and telling me to come back in 3 weeks.

I am lost, I don't know what to do, how to get better. I don't trust anyone in the system and I just want to get better.

46,depression,"Hi everyone,
My psychologist recently asked me how I would feel about taking medication for anxiety and depression. She recommended Lexapro.
Of course I want to feel better, so I said that it sounded ok and I would probably give it a try. (I’m still a teenager though so she’ll have to talk to my parents about it)

But now, I’m having second thoughts.
The main reason is I’m doubting that there’s anything wrong with me. I mean, I am definitely having symptoms of depression, and a professional has even agreed it sounds like depression. 
Yet I’m still doubting it. It’s so frustrating because it’s making me think I’m crazy. I almost feel like since I don’t have it nearly as bad as some people, that mine doesn’t need to be treated or something, I guess. 

Like, whenever I smile or laugh, or my mood is ok or fine, I immediately start thinking, 'oh, you can’t be depressed if you were just smiling a minute ago' or 'if you feel fine then you’re not really depressed'. It changes too. One minute I could be 100% convinced that I am depressed, but then it can switch to me doubting everything. Sometimes I get a sudden urge to make things better, but I have no motivation to actually do anything about it. Or maybe I’m just lazy.
I’m so confused.
Is it just my head messing with me?

48,depression,"I feel really embarrassed when I post about my thoughts and feelings, but sometimes I just get so desperate to hear that it will be ok, even if it comes from a stranger.

I've been feeling more depressed in the last few weeks than I have in a really long time. I'm just so exhausted emotionally and mentally.

My family is pretty toxic and there is constant drama with them. I have a lot of unresolved resentment and angry for my mom and it makes it really difficult to have any sort of conversation with her. 

Recently my mom decided to move to another state with my stepdad (who I get along with pretty well). She said that I could take this chance to go with them if I pay for half of the move (even though she is not asking this of my two other adult siblings who are going as well, it's always been pretty clear I'm the least favorite). I've been struggling with this decision for a while because I've been really struggling financially,  just barely able to pay my bills. I usually have less than $50 by the time my next paycheck comes in. I don't know how I will be able to help pay for the move and also keep my car while searching for a job in the new state. I also dread the thought of living with my family again when we first get there while I find a place. My family is toxic even when I don't have to interact with them daily, living with them is pure hell. 

The reason I have seriously been thinking of going is because I hate the state I live in now. I live in a VERY overly religious state and because I am not religious,  I have a very difficult time dating and making friends here. I feel stuck and have wanted an opportunity to leave pretty much my whole life. I feel like this is my chance to finally go somewhere better.

Last week, I got an email saying my credit score dropped 130 points for a past due bill of $30. I paid the bill immediately because I didnt know that I had any outstanding balances anywhere and called the bank. The bank said this will stay on my credit report for 7 years. I have no idea why it dropped so much for just $30 but now I know it will be so much harder to find an apartment in this new state. 

There are a lot of other details to this that add to why I'm so depressed but this has already turned into a super long post and I'm sorry. I just have no one to get it out to. I have no friends, no money. I feel like I'm supposed to have this all figured out by now but I don't and I just don't see any light at the end of this tunnel. I just don't know what to do. Part of me just doesn't even care anymore and am just done with it all.

Now I'm att Four hours a day and was just about to try six hours out. 

But then things started to fall apart. I had proven to be able to work and therefore did not need help anymore. 
After a few days and a lot of help, I was able to get into a similar program, difference is the money. I'll get a lot less from this one, and it is more complicated. Lots of forms I need to fill out and get to the right person. 
It sounds so stupid when I write it, like boo hoo, I still have something. But it feels like hell either way. 

I had to move back in with my dad and family about a year ago. I can't keep living with them. They are not like me, they can't understand what I'm going through, it's not in their DNA. I am grateful that they let me move back home. But I feel so trapped, I can't be me, I can't do what I need to feel better. 
My family and I don't really get along. My stepmom hates me, my younger sister doesn't understand and my dad is, well he's living in a different world than I am.

Since I'm not going to get the amount of money needed to afford to live by myself, I sought help from the government. 
I just got the call that they won't help me.

Long time lurker first time poster on this sub.

I've had the thought that I have some sort depression or mania-depresia of sort for the last 7 years or so. It comes in waves, could be a few hours, a few days, or more. There are good times as well but not a lot of them, and usually I end up regretting a lot of my actions during these time.

Lately it has gotten worse and I am feeling overwhelmed. I haven't worked in the last year or so, some of it by choice (took some time to see the world and time for myself) but ever since I came back 6 months ago I can't seem to be able to get my life together. I got rejected at every job interview I went to, I spent money on things I don't actually need in an empty attempt to make myself feel good.

I don't enjoy my hobbies anymore, they just feel empty now, and yet I keep sinking money into them.

I have no idea why I'm writing this down now. I got rejected from a big company I was really hoping to get to work for today. I don't believe writing this will help, but I need to vent and I got nowhere else to go.

I'm not really suicidal so you don't have to worry about that. The thought has gone through my mind a few times, but I'm not going to do it. I have a passion for good alcohol but stopped myself from drinking in the last 6 months or so, I don't think drinking right now is a good idea.

But these last few days have been tough. I've just been so sad. I've cried for 3 days straight, my brain finding every single thing to be upset over. It's honestly tiring. I've gone through the same emotions. Anger, upset, sadness. 

It's not like I'm alone. I've actually gone out with a lot of people these past few days and they're all such nice people and we have fun but I just feel so useless. So lonely. It's gotten to a point where I've gotten short with my best friend which I will call Jack.

Jack is honestly one of the best people I've met. Till the day I die, I'll never regret knowing him. There was moments where I've doubted if he loves me as much as I love him. If he think I'm his number one as much as he is to me. Friendship wise at least. Two days I've talked to him crying and finally, yesterday we resolved my insecurities and our petty fights.

63,depression,"Hi all....maybe someone can related and empathize. I'm almost 32 and really, really want a partner. I've been dating and looking for someone for close to the past 8 years now and never had a relationship last longer than 5 months. Of the three relationships I've had in the past 8 years, two have broken up with me on valentines day. The second to last relationship I had, the guy gave me an STD (HPV causing genital warts), which didn't show up until I was in the relationship with the guy after him. The last guy I was with, I was completely and totally in love with, and he made it seem extremely mutual. I thought I had finally found the person I was going to be with for life. He asked me to move in with him, but then broke up with me 3 days later. So now I'm single, my heart is completely crushed, and I have an STD. Unlike most people's HPV, mine hasn't gone away. It's been almost a year and I've tried tons of different things for it and none have worked. So it seems like I'm just going to have fucking warts forever, which means I can't even have sex. 

As you might imagine, my depression is back in full force. Every day I wake up and remember I have a disgusting disease that is going to make it impossible for me to have the ONE thing in life I want - love and companionship. I'm 31 so of course all my friends are getting engaged, married, buying houses, all of that. And I can't even go on a date anymore. All shreds of hope I had of finding anyone to share life with is gone. Every day I wake up and cry about it because I can't imagine anything worse than what I've gone through the past 8 years of getting my heart crushed and not being able to find anyone when everyone around me just easily finds love. And now I can't even TRY to find anyone anymore because I have an STD. 

I  feel like if there's something bad that can happen to me, it will. Who gets broken up with TWICE on valentines day? Who has someone want to move in, then break up with no warning 3 days later? Who else gets the HPV vaccine before they ever sleep with anyone, and has always used condoms, and gets warts, and unlike everyone else's warts, they won't go away? The chances of all of that happening are like .000000001%, yet they ALL happen to me. It's like every worst case scenario I can imagine in life comes true, and of course it all is stuff that will prevent me from ever finding anyone, which is all I want in life. I barely had any hope left for finding anyone BEFORE I got this fucking STD...now that tiny shred is gone. 

I know life is unfair, but I can't imagine a worse way to go through life than being alone and diseased and unable to even have sex, let alone find love. I guess I hadn't found love before this so maybe the STD doesn't even matter, but now I don't even have the illusion that I might find it in the future, so I can't even pretend like it's out there for me. 

I wake up every day and think about how horrible my life is and how I'm living my worst nightmare of being alone for the rest of my life. It doesn't seem worth it to live in this miserable way for the next \~60 years. It's incredibly painful to be surrounded constantly by the stream of weddings, engagements, etc. Even my friends who weren't actively looking for a partner all stumbled into finding love. I couldn't find any when I tried for 8 years, all I found out was that I'm unlovable. Now I'm unlovable and also undateable and untouchable. 

My mom has suggested I get a dog, but I also live in a super high cost living area, in a studio apartment that doesn't allow dogs. The only way I could ever afford to move is if I was living with someone and splitting costs. So now I also know that I'll never be able to move, or get a dog, both of which my ex and I were planning on doing which makes it all the more painful. I just don't see my life ever changing, at least not for the better. 

I just can't believe how shitty my life has turned out, and no one understands. Therapists haven't been any help, nor have my friends. Because literally nothing anyone can possibly say will change the fact I have an STD, and I was unlovable before this.

I realized that I don’t need another lover/companion to make me happy, although it is a nice feeling. It all starts with myself. Before I am able to truly love someone again I have to learn how to love myself and be happy with who I am. Its starting to flow to me so much easier now, but I’ll admit it’s a hard mentality to keep in the early stage.

72,depression,"I hate my life, and everyone hates me--that's not an exaggeration. I am annoying and mean and I can't help it. I don't like my body or the way my brain works. I have anxiety and mania and paranoia and very frequent episodes of each. I've been on medicine since I was fourteen and the medicine helps but things have gotten worse as I'm an adult now and so many things are harder.

I don't want to kill myself because I don't want to die but I don't see much other choice. I can't get out of bed most days or even do the basic things like walk the dog, wash my dishes. Even brushing my teeth feels like a chore. I have a job just to make money so I have food to eat and I keep making mistakes there. I hate my job. I don't have an education so I don't have any other option except another shitty minimum wage job or to go back to school, which I can't afford.

I cannot remember the last time I was happy. I have been depressed since I was a child. My parents were abusive and my father blamed me for his own suicide attempts and incarceration. I know it's not my fault because I've been through years of therapy to learn the way they've treated me was not right but it still ruined my childhood and ruined the way I see myself as an adult.

74,depression,"Hiii so I guess I will start this post by saying that I’m currently in law school and just finished my first year back in May. I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety, but now that I’m in law school it’s just gotten so much worse to the point that it’s almost unbearable and I can’t even concentrate on anything other than how shitty I feel about myself. In undergrad (which I understand is an entirely different animal than law school), I always made good grades (mostly A’s, some B’s) when I was actually giving it my best effort. But now in law school I’m trying so much harder than I ever have, and all I have to show for it is a bunch of C’s and C+’s. I would be fine with that if it wasn’t for the fact that our grades are based on a curve, so it’s all about how well you perform on the exam compared to your classmates. And then when I see the grade distributions and I’m always falling in the bottom 10-20 people in class out of like 70+, it just really makes me feel like a dumb piece of shit. And then to top it all off, I found out yesterday that I was rejected from all three of the legal journals at school when writing was the one thing I thought I was actually legitimately talented at but it turns out I’m unexceptional in that also. And then it sucks even harder when all of my friends are celebrating their much better grades and their success in the journal competition, and Im just out here bringing everybody down because I’m the only one who is constantly falling short at everything. So I’ve just been feeling super down on myself and very lonely because no one I know here can relate to feeling like a mediocre (at best) loser all the time because they’ve never done anything other than be highly successful. I just feel like everything I’ve done in law school so far has been a complete failure, and I feel like I’m wasting money putting myself through all of this because I will never be able to compete against these people who are clearly way more intelligent than me in the real world. Ughhhhhh...I think that’s enough though, so I will end my self-absorbed sob story here. If you made it all the way to this point, I deeply apologize, and I truly hope you have a much better day than I am having!

78,depression,"I have been trying to piece myself together, for a fifth year now.

It is ludicrous how when I was in the darkest hour in my life, and I was happier. It was like living in the deep sea, all the unwanted rage, they pressured me together, they gave me a purpose. They gave me an enemy.

As long as you’re fighting something, you’re alive.

I didn’t win, I outlived. I endured. I survived. And I collapsed.

The final days of my high school years are just me counting days till I never have to see any of their faces again. Until I don’t have to pretend not remembering how they completed destroy me, until I don’t have to talk to them with a fake smiley face, until I wouldn’t have to look over my shoulders, until I don’t have to run away from anybody, until I can lift up my head, until I can be me.

And the day had come, five years ago.

You’d think time will heal. Not everything, but at least SOMETHING, but no, everyday I just feel like I’m drowning and screaming silently. I have no idea how I became this. Yes, I do have a job, in the exact same school I was bullied in. I don’t particularly feel anything. You can say that I’m just...a living void.

One can say that there are a lot of people who have been bullied in their lives, and they’ve turned out okay. Maybe. Maybe it’s just me being much too sensitive, or it’s just my cry for help, while in reality none of these will make me any better.

I’m just, confused and empty. I use to buy food and let them rot. I wanted to eat but I let myself starve. I had choices but I didn’t make them.

It is easier to just give up, but I made it. I finished my master’s degree with a decent score. Find myself a job, find myself a SO, find myself a bunch of friends. 

None of the above can actually chase away the darkness for me. I’ll have to do it myself, and I probably wouldn’t win, not at first.

I can give up, it’s easy to do so, but I wouldn’t.

This is just me, fighting my inner darkness, one day at a time.

Thank you for reading.

I’ll keep on living, until the day I can’t. Until then, my friends, until then.","I have been trying to piece myself together, for a fifth year now.",1562165237.0

On his way to his new sparkling life, he decided to destroy my spirit as well. He unloaded on me everything that he believes is wrong with me and how he can do/want so much better. He admits that he's been holding me up to an ideal that I'm unable to meet. After 20 years he said he's tired of the all the pain he feels and work he has to do trying to get me to meet those ideals. He realized after all these years that he's not the kind of man who would work to commit to a relationship. I've absorbed it all like a sponge. I've always been this way, where it's hard for me to take a compliment, but very easy to believe criticisms and insults.

We shared friends and they are uncomfortable with the divorce as well. They ""don't want to take sides"" and therefore abandoned both of us. I guess they were never truly friends.

Fast forward through a year of living at uni where the stress of school made me exhausted as I was trying to keep up perfect grades to apply again to this program, I left first year with +20 pounds after losing 50 throughout high school and a bad mental state. Not sure what changed during the summer but I found out that I was accepted into this dream school and my eating patterns catapulted into something i never thought would happen. I began working in a factory and would bring a 200 calorie lunch, go to the gym after work and eat 1000 calories after so I could go to sleep feeling full. Then as weekends came I would binge and try to purge but could never go through with it thankfully. Come second year and I’m starting at my new program but what I thought would be the happiest year of my life was the worst, my desire to talk to family, friends and even go to the gym deteriorated as all I cared about was school. For the past almost year since September I struggle to wake up. I’ve always been a disciplined student from nothing other than my desire to have perfect grades, which I still managed to keep up during the year but this summer as I study for the MCAT I cannot keep focus for more than 30 minutes.

I’ve done the best job of my life controlling my depression over the past year, but today I had a  bit of a breakdown.  There are certain things that I can’t even think about or else it’ll send me into a vicious mental cycle of self loathing.  Depression restricts my thoughts.  I am constantly playing a game where I have to keep my thoughts clear of certain ideas or memories or else I surrender myself to that familiar hopeless feeling in the bottom of my stomach.  Depression prevents me from unlocking my mind.  I don’t think I’ll ever be able to reach my full potential while having to play a game of chicken in my own brain.  

I’ve been off antidepressants for the past 10 months, and while I consider it to be the greatest accomplishment of my life I think I’m cursed to live a life of walking on eggshells with my mind.

111,depression,"As I traverse my most recent and current bout with depression, I’ve been asking myself: how can I help myself? Well, as it turns out, the answers aren’t that hard to find. There are things all around me that add to my depression and I’m fully aware of them and have been for quite some time. Today I’m taking control.

Social media provides “services” for us that ultimately contribute little to our overall well-being. They basically suck the souls out of users, get us hooked on their platforms, shove ads down our throats and makes billions of dollars in the process. What do we get? Nothing.

I woke up this morning and decided to eliminate things that really don’t add anything to my life, and replace those things that impact my life in positive ways. I started with social media apps. Facebook being the first to go.

For me, Facebook is the most toxic and only underscores the superficial, the passing interests of the day, political outrage of the moment (a big one for me), and people trying really hard to convince themselves and everyone else that the world would be perfectly fine if we just saw things their way. Oh, and then there’s all those narcissistic posts. Facebook is not real life and if you ask for advice on Facebook, typically all you get is placated with platitudes and patronized. It’s time for more face-to-face human interactions and fewer meaningless interactions.

The second app to go, Instagram. I didn’t have that many followers in the first place, but I followed a lot of beautiful people with seemingly stunning lives. Who knows if these people really experienced lives as extravagant and glamorous as they I, or anyone else perceived them to be. It’s hard to say, but whatever the case, thumbing through pics of “the beautiful people” is not real life either. It’s people offering up a FaceTuned photo, one out of 50 I’ll bet, and getting their dopamine hit. Trying to keep up with that kind of energetic existence is, for me, untenable.

The third social media account to go was Twitter. This was a hard one because I barely knew anyone, but I had thousands of followers because of my profession. But I’ve never received any meaningful gratification from Twitter (or any social app aside from Reddit) so there’s no love lost there. I liked my lists, but Reddit has better lists quite honestly.

The irony of this post is here I am posting this on Reddit. A story about a social media purge to a different social platform, and I’m okay with it. I don’t know why, but Reddit feels different. No one is coming for me, no one is trying to hookup with me, no one likes every fucking thing I post, and no one even knows my name or where I live. It feels freeing.

Depression is a fucker and I’m sick of feeling this way day after day. I know what dark energy can do for my self-esteem and I know what the light can do. I know that sulking around the house is no good for me, I know I have to get out of the house more. I know I have to cut out foods and beverages that affect my behavior and I have to get back to the gym. I know these things.

I have had two friends reach out over the last few weeks and try to plan things with me but it’s not helping. One I have always felt unable to connect with emotionally and open up to. The other is the total opposite, but feeling good with him feels bad. We used to have a much closer relationship but things went bad for a while. I feel like he’s the only person who really gets me, and that I feel comfortable around. But I don’t think we will ever have the same type of relationship that we used to have, the kind I desire, but he doesn’t. 

I have been casually agreeing to all future plans because I don’t think I’ll be here to follow through anyways. And agreeing to it pleases my friends. All my therapist wants to talk about is the future, I go along with the discussion but it is hard sometimes because I haven’t actually given it any thought. 

I have been fantasizing about running away with my dog. She is the only thing that brings me some kind of joy. Sometimes I think that maybe if we were alone together somewhere else I’d feel different. I used to enjoy sleeping too but the nightmares have ruined that.

I'm 36 years old and facing a career transition. I'm in a bad rut.  I've finished my Master's degree in Bioinformatics, but am finding it IMPOSSIBLE to find a job in my field. I would love to get a position as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst. I feel like I have been ghosted by countless employers. If I reach out to hiring managers or contacts on LinkedIn, I am ignored. I always make sure to sound passionate about the position or company I am applying to. Those contacts that have talked to me can't seem to help my get a job, but are telling me that I'm, ""doing all the right things.""

142,depression,"I am re-posting [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/c8odyw/i_messed_up_and_am_in_a_downward_emotional_spiral/) from r/mentalhealth here as I am just looking for whatever help I can get.

&amp;#x200B;

To  preface, I have had emotional issues for a long time. I was in a bad  marriage that left some deep scars. I have had a hard time opening up to  people (friends or family), I have a hard time trusting people, my self  esteem is pretty low, and have balled up every emotion I have ever had  and suppressed it deep inside for many many years now. It has made me  feel like complete garbage, but I didn't know what else to do, and  didn't think I needed help.

&amp;#x200B;

After  my marriage I jumped right in to another relationship, and it was very  co-dependent. She was an amazing person, but my emotional issues were  deep. She also had similar issues, and at times we clashed quite a bit.  Fast forward 3 years. We were engaged and about a month away from our  wedding. We had a pretty good thing going on. There was lots of love.  However, we had a big fight. It was over an issue that had come up many  times in the past, but this time it was different. The emotions ran high  in this one. We were both screaming at the top of our lungs, saying  things we didn't mean. She got in my face, screaming,  and I just had a knee jerk reaction to it. A stupid, stupid reaction  that has sent me in a spiral. When she got in my face, I just put my  hands up and pushed her back. Didn't even think about about. It was one  of those moments where your body just reacts to a stimulus, and there is  nothing you can do.  She stumbled back a few steps and tripped over the  hamper and fell on the floor. And that was the moment my life changed.

&amp;#x200B;

20  minutes later I was in handcuffs in the back of a police cruiser being  taken away. I have no criminal record. I have never laid my hands on  anyone before, especially her. I have no history of violence, I have no  history of abuse. I'm a very quiet, introverted person, on the  anti-social side, and I would never hurt anyone. My whole life came  crashing down on me in this instance. I lost the love of my life. My  best friend. My family. The place I called home. I lost it all, and I  hurt her emotionally beyond anything I can even comprehend.

&amp;#x200B;

I  have also destroyed myself. Not a day goes by that I don't cry. I can  no longer hold in my emotions. Its like a flood gate. They poor out  every second of every day and I don't know how to handle it. I don't  know how to cope, or deal with any of this. I don't know how to handle  these emotions. I face serious charges that could destroy everything I  have worked so hard to accomplish in life. I now have this label of an  ""abuser"" over my head that I still cant wrap my mind around. Every day  feels worse than the next.

&amp;#x200B;

I  have been in steady therapy since this has happened. I have opened up  to friends and family as a means of support. But it all just seems like  too much at times. I am just overwhelmed by everything. Everything I  feel, everything I have caused for others, everything I am facing. I  just don't know what to do with it all, or how to handle it and feel  like I am losing the battle. They same time heals all wounds, but I just  feel like its getting worse.

&amp;#x200B;

What  do I do? I just don't know what to do with any of this. I need help,  and have taken steps but I just feel like I am not doing enough. I don't  know. I just don't know.

144,depression,"The world looks so different when I am on medication, and it gives me a feeling that I have no idea what reality is. It really frightens me.

A few days ago I tried slightly reducing my SSRI dose because of annoying side effects. Two days later I had gone from doing better than I had in months to obsessively suicidal. I went from seeing myself and my life in a positive way to seeing myself as a monster. I thought about people I know being sad if I committed suicide and found myself actually trying to understand why we didn't all just commit suicide together. Life seemed so horrific that I felt like everyone must be secretly suffering this way. 

This morning I went back to my original dose and although I'm a bit shaky this evening, my earlier thoughts seem bizarre and things look brighter. But I don't understand how a tablet can completely change how the whole world looks. 

I also sometimes take xanax in emergencies and I don't know how a nervous system suppressant can make all the evil in the world and in myself disappear in 30 minutes.

hi guys. i'm not really an active redditor, but i feel like i have nowhere else to go. i figured why not rant to a bunch of strangers who can't judge me because they don't know me. so anyways

i'm a college student [19F] and i've had anxiety and depression basically as long as i can remember.

from ages 5 to about 9 or 10(?) i was ""friends"" with this girl who was a little bit older and lived next door to me. she bullied the hell out of me and sexually assaulted me, but something in me looked up to her and i wanted to be around her. eventually we grew apart and stopped being friends.
after that my anxiety was absolutely horrible but it seemed to mellow out and then spike back up every now and then. my mom is a really caring person and would use guided meditation with me to help me calm down (though meditation gives me anxiety now)

in middle school i was bullied too, i was fatter than all my friends; puberty hit my body but not my face. i had a small friend group but all the boys in the school would make fun of the way i looked or that i was into anime or whatever. 

in late high school i was in a long distance relationship with someone for about a year that was emotionally abusing me. i didn't realize it at the time so i told him all about my childhood trauma and my insecurities; some of the deepest and most personal aspects of my life. we broke up badly. i had a panic attack so badly i threw up. i still wonder if he makes fun of me or if he told anyone about my trauma without my knowledge/consent. he would, and it scares me so badly.

after that i finally made the steps to see a therapist, but when i told her i was experiencing suicidal thoughts, she told me she couldn't see me until i was properly diagnosed, but i didn't feel like i got a direct diagnosis? i didn't visit that therapist anymore, and got a new one who really worked for me. i felt like i was finally making progress, but then i had to move away for college.

i thought i would like the independent and private life of college but i actually feel so lonely and pathetic.

TLDR; i'm so depressed i can't even bother to turn on the tv or pee when i need to. when i look in the mirror i want to vomit because of how disgusting i am. i feel like i can't trust anyone or that people who are trying to help me are just there to make fun of me or get dirt on me. i cancel plans because i feel too ugly. i don't know what to do. what is wrong with me?","is anyone else's self confidence so low, you fluctuate between painful indifference and just absolutely despising yourself?",1562125680.0

Not everything has to make sense in the moment, sometimes things click and make sense way later, and the best thing you can do is push through these moments. 

They say patience is a virtue and it really is. It teaches you so many things, without patience you won't be resilient enough to wait for the good things in life.

I believe we all know how to be patient because life throws tests at us that teach us to tolerate delays and sufferings. 

We all think we are bad at it, because it's not enjoyable, but we all know how to do it.

My 4 year old niece always says ""I am not good at waiting"", it sounds funny when she says it because she's 4, but we all feel this way. She expresses it in such a simple way, but we all truly feel like we aren't good at waiting because we simply don't like to wait, we don't like to wait through the hard times, through the delays, and through the sufferings. 

Next time you don't feel like waiting, just remember there's something good coming.

I had a super toxic coworker who made me miserable at work but then I’d unfortunately think about her away from work because she was so evil and conniving. She finally left. But she was a big source of stress and depression. I couldn’t just leave because I need the job/career.

180,depression,"I don't know why I'm writing this. I feel optimistic about the future one minute, and then empty and hopeless the next. Haha maybe the void can help me? I don't know. 

I ruined my life. At least I feel like I did. I'm 20 and  failed pretty much all of my 2nd year university courses. I'm required to withdraw for a year. I wasted 8k. I have to get a job to start paying the loans by November. I'm telling myself to use this year to get better. It all feels absolutely hopeless. Is my life over? 

I wanted to major in Psychology but I failed the math credits I needed twice, so I switched to Sociology. I wanted to go onto a Social Work program after University but I feel like that door is closed now. I wanted to help teens and youth because I know how terrible depression and anxiety is. How will I help others when I need help myself? I don't even know if getting back into University after a year is feasible at this point. 

My parents think everything is absolutely dandy and fine. I've been trying to gather the courage to tell my dad about depression and anxiety. I've been struggling with this for most of my life but I'd say it's reached its worst in the last 4 years. High School was hell, I thought University would be different... I just can't handle it. I have 0 motivation to do any readings, and skipped every exam. Everyday my thought process was ""I'm going to die anyway, why does this matter?"". 

Severe social anxiety has left me trapped, everything feels IMPOSSIBLE. It takes an enormous amount of energy to do simple tasks like handing out job resumes, making any kind of phonecall, going into public, even talking to my own family is hard. Uni lectures and tutorials are hell. I don't talk to anyone but people online and my family. I was practically mute in High School and couldn't talk to anyone at Uni either. This illness makes it feel like there's no point trying and has definitely amplified the depression to unbearable levels. I don't even know how I'm even writing this right now. 

When I see people walk by, I imagine they have their life together while I'm some subhuman who let everything fall apart. I feel like an alien. Everyone is superior and deserves to live here.

183,depression,"My depression and anxiety have only gotten worse as the years have gone by. I feel like even when it was there as a teen, I could at least have some days where there wasn't an overbearing feeling of me not being worthy of existing. I hate almost everything about myself. I wish I was normal, that I could meet somebody and actually have a normal conversation rather than nervously not saying much. I despise the way I look, apps like Tinder and OkCupid only confirming my thoughts about my looks. But that's not it, I don't actually know what's wrong with me. I got about 100 or more conversations on OkCupid, and not one of them ever became anything more. People usually end up ignoring me or forgetting about me, which I don't blame them for. After so many conversations, I know that it HAS to be something wrong with me. I've pretty much accepted that I'm going to live the rest of my life alone. The butchering of my only chance at love confirmed it in my mind. I guess people were right when they said not to enter a relationship until you're happy with yourself, because it hurt me pretty badly 

I've become so angry as time goes on. The smallest things seem to just tick me off and have me cursing like a maniac. Reflecting on that anger always leaves me feeling more pathetic for showing that side of myself, even if nobody is in sight. For years, I've balled up everything, I keep private about most things in my life. I sometimes feel like a stranger even around the people I care about. I don't even have a future. The thing I'm interested in, which is making music, would literally be what I'd want to do, but just seeing the sheer amount of people that I see making music that   will most likely never be able to create a career out of it are so high that I realize it would also very likely be the reality for me. Plus, I haven't even touched an instrument, I don't even know how I could accomplish it. 

I don't want to exist anymore. I think everybody hates me, but I also know in the back of my mind that there are some people that would be devastated if I were to end my life, so I'm too afraid to hurt them. Lately, I rarely brush and don't even shower daily like I used to. I feel so close to giving up. I'm terrified of therapy, I can't tell somebody this in person without tearing up, and I don't even think I could find the words to describe how I feel in person, I'd probably just lie or choke up.

194,depression,"It's been like 8 months since I've truly met depression and it's been a really poor experience to me. Right now I'm in a better state and although not much has changed since then, I did and I wanted to share a few things that helped throughout my journey. Back then I saw nobody share experiences and felt so alone. And some of you out there don't look here just to see others share their pain and are actually looking to fix themselves.

Here are the main things that helped me:

1. **Nobody is gonna help you**. Sorry. You might be able to reach out for some small things but in the grand scheme of things nobody is gonna help you at all to fix your problems. This is why people here say ""when you are depressed nobody cares"". Depression is a huge negative factor and most people forget about it as soon as they are free from it. It hurts my hurt writing this and reminding myself of what I've been through. Nobody wants to deal with somebody else's problems because everybody has a problem.  
With that being said, stop expecting help from anybody. Help yourself. You are probably expecting a person to pick you up, it won't happen. You are only by yourself and you are the only changing factor. If you're in school and you're struggling, get better. If you're stuck in your house raging at video games, hit the gym, go outside. Help yourself. Accept the fact YOU have all of the strength. I know that as much as you all hate reading this, **if you don't trust me right now you will learn it the hard way. I'm sorry.**
2. **People will let you down and you need to break away from them.** This is a huge mistake I did. I put all my faith into people because I felt so alone and wanted to do anything to get along with them. The people you want to stick with are atrocious, disgusting, disappointing. They have huge flaws that you skip over because you just want to be with somebody. Man up and become the right person instead of being like them. Accept the fact that when you're in shit people will **NOT prove worthy** and that with depression you need to analyze your environment and classify people and get away from those you don't need. Have you ever had a ""friend"" discourage you every time because **he is so much better than you at anything?** **You are absolutely fucking blind. Never compare yourself to anyone ever again.** I used to compare myself all the time with a classmate of mine, ""he is more fit than me"", ""he has so many girls in his friend's list"", ""he has so many more friends"", ""he's good at everything"". That was the dumbest argument I've ever had in my head. In reality, the guy is cringe worthy, cannot hold a proper conversation, chokes on every task beside what he is good at, and is simply disappointing. And even where he seemed better at, once I put my time and head into those things I was the same as him. **Don't let anybody discourage you.**
3. **No matter what you do against depression you will have to hit rock bottom in order to overcome it.** I could not get away from this state until the moment I wanted to genuinely die. And I could not understand a few things before learning them the hard way.
4. **Don't lose hope. It's a human's strongest tool and it's been the factor that pushed humanity to where we are. Without hope we would not have evolved to this stage and without it everybody would die.** Hope is the thing that you can always gain easily. It's the thing that you can always regain. It's simply a tool meant for us to gain strength and face life. It's always there. It's our core. Most people lose hope before suiciding but hope is always there and it's still valid. Say that you can do things, believe you can go over things, open your head and think that you have the strength to do it. **Life can turn around as easily and it went wrong and it takes very little time to happen, you just have to move yourself to that stage.** Even in the deepest of shit you are stuck in hope that you can find a way out and think of the smallest thing that can get you out. Don't lose sight of the future. Never. Ever. Again. **Hope is a genuine thing and is what pushed me this far to this day.**
5. **Being depressed for no reason is nothing but a lie and every day you wake up depressed has a clear explanation you simply are not aware of and you need to analyze your life like a math problem and acknowledge the problem.** You most likely feel depressed out of nowhere because of the things you falsely went over by. I had a stage where I would just wake up mid day and stay in my house playing video games until late night. I would be very disappointed and stressed out because that's all I could do during day time. I woke up every morning depressed not knowing the reason. I then realized the pattern and decided to change it and guess what suddenly no more depressed mornings. **There is a pattern in depression and you need to change things in order to localize the exact problem.**
6. **NEVER hold your anger inside just because you are shy or you were educated to be polite.** Ever had moments where somebody told you something that really ticked you off and you went quiet and just taught about it and eventually went up depressed? **That means you are REALLY fucking pissed off. You're angry.** But because you are holding it in yourself depression kicks in, you feel guilty for no reason. Tell that person what ticked you off. Whether it's their ego or false self confidence, tell them in their face. Let out your anger. They had no right to put you in that state and they need to pay for it. For example some classmates always let me down and discouraged me when it came to exams. One day some dude told me after I said I felt very insecure about it how easy he feels it's gonna be and laughed at me for being so insecure. I held myself and started thinking ""he is so much better than me"" ""what did I do wrong why am I so bad"". NO. I later learned in a similar scenario to reply properly. I told them how fucking inflated the person's ego is, how bad he truly is, how he is going to fall to my knees, how I've been tired of being looked down upon and that now it's my time to smash his head against the walls. My chest went from being to tight to being incredibly free and I felt so happy and energetic after saying that.
7. This is a small one but **don't cope with drugs or alcohol.** It's a costly way of running away from yourself. Not to mention you fuck your health. Don't be a pussy and face your problems instead of running away. Cope with harmless things such as music or drawing. Don't get addicted to video games either. I recommend listening to Three Days Grace, they helped me the most through this journey.",How to deal with depression as a teen,1562159067.0

199,depression,"Hello everyone. I'm sure you have seen probably too many of kinda-like-this topics, but i really need some advice for people that have gone through dark times.

As title says, i think i have busted a dead end. I have encountered a situation where it is necessary for me to make a future of myself, since the finanical/family/social crysis has grown a lot for these 4 years.

I am 23 years old, i live on Balkans (poor countries), and i can't get through university. I used to blast the school before and was really good at maths and programming. I always imagined that i could study engineering, get a good job, help myself and my poor family. But as soon i moved on from my city, and to the capital city, things got really worse. I ended up getting mentally fucked up, first time at shrink, diagnosed with several mental ilnesses, a suicide atempt, a  failure on studying, and failure at life as a whole. I realise that i am a money-sink and i can't even get a grip. 3 years of medical attention haven't helped me at all. With such wide range of pills, therapies, social work, i kinda expected i will retain my will to live. But i didn't. It is a path downhill.

So, people of this thread, i am asking of your personal experience what would you do in my skin. Work a job? Study a course? Study something else? Just move away? Try something new? A lot of things contributes to my no-productivity, as i lost the mental power to study, lost the will to work, lost my hopes and dreams at achieving something, i can't even imagine anymore what could i ever become in this world. For the studying part, i could move to another city, study something easier, but i don't know will i have the mental power to continue. In our country, electrical engineering is considered the hardest (it is subjective, of course, but it is a really strict regime), so maybe i would eventually succed at something?

I just wish to have a reason to wake up at the morning. I don't remember last time feeling accomplished, lovely, rest, or any type of happy. I wish to have a stable ground to work on, and to get a will to work on. I want to know that i will for sure eat today. I don't want any type of charities or giveaways or something, i already feel guilty for my familly even supporting me. They should just tell me to go so i can be a burden no more. My only wish is that one morning i don't wake up at all, so i can stop feeling guilt and make other lives easier. I guess it is not a good way to look at things, at this situation. I know some of you have really gone through some really nasty traumas, and have recovered from far, far more deadly experiences. But right now for me, this seems like there is no way forward. So that is why i am asking for you if you could share your wisdom.

I don't think  i have any special talents. I am/was good at math, programming, and music. I have lost all my self-esteem about knowing any of these things, and i can assure, i am really useless in all other branches. I hate  the fact that multiple tests done at psychiatry clinic showed me as 'intelligent, thoughtful' , where i feel that i am unable to succeed in any path in life (work, studying, money, friends, family etc.) I hope i can wake up some day, and say: Hey, i have something to do (so i can improve myself)! Just like in video games, except that main character, well, is me.

206,depression,"So this is going to be a bit of a long one as I have a lot to get off my chest. I am a 28M ""student"" and musician (the quotation marks will be explained soon). I will begin with a list of the things that are directly on my mind and then will continue on from there. All of these issues come down to avoidant behaviours that are ruining my life.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have not been to university in 4 months as I fell so far behind on my work and was so overwhelmed that I simply stopped going. I am in my second year and did incredibly well in my first year. I explained this to the student counsellor and he said he would try to get my fail grades reversed at the end of semester. It is now past the end of semester and I have not reached out to him again to fix it, nor have I told my parents that I am no longer attending as I don't know if I can deal with their disappointment.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have acquired a few thousand dollars worth parking fines from when I first moved to my new city for parking out the front of my house. I did not pay them, then continued to ignore the piles of letters. I don't know what the total is at. I can't register my car anymore because of the outstanding fines.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have not filed a tax return since 2011 because I don't know where to begin with chasing all of that up.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly in looking at these things written down it all seems trivial and solvable, but now we run into my avoidant behaviour, and I guess chronic laziness. Regardless of how much I get pushed, or the carrots or sticks that are dangled in front of me, I always avoid uncomfortable situations. It is easier to sleep than face my problems.

I gig on weekends and am a private music tutor during the week, as well as being on welfare for students, so I'm not in total poverty, but certainly not financially stable. Performing requires me to be a social and happy person, but I've been finding my social fuse running very, very short lately. Nobody knows how dark my thoughts are. I wake up and think of suicide, if I give my brain a spare few seconds to think it goes to thoughts of putting a gun against my head, jumping off a building, standing in front of a train; it's a constant barrage. It's exhausting, and I'm constantly listening to podcasts, reading or listening to music to try and drown the thoughts out.

I feel that even if I solve the above listed issues, I have underlying behavioural issues around motivation and avoidance that will constantly undermine my ability to live well, and I don't think I can tolerate that for the rest of my life.

A guy I knew years ago killed himself over the weekend. I didn't know him that well, but a friend of mine called me as they were once romantically involved. My friend was beside himself, and was perplexed at the thought of this guy killing himself. I had to pretend like it was a shocking thing to do... Even though suicidal thoughts are running through my mind constantly.

I feel like I can't tell anyone how bad it really is, because I don't want to be treated like an ticking bomb although, ironically, I feel like a ticking bomb.

It ended two years ago, the happiness, excitement, my life.
Nothing can make me excited. Not a concert, new friend, old friends, nothing. It’s like two years ago my life just walked up and left. I wake up and it’s the same thing, everyday. Work, sleep, work, sleep. It’s never ending. Changing jobs did nothing, I didn’t care, still the same old feeling. Bored. Boredom.
Driving me mad. I hate it, the constant thing always happening. Nothing changes.
I wake up and wait for the next time I get to sleep. I could sleep all day, 10, 13, 16 hours of sleep. More if it was probable. My money goes to bills, I have no money. Sometimes I’m worried I won’t be able to eat. Gas or food? Which one do I need more.

I don’t, I sit there, calmly. I don’t want to hurt myself or anyone so I sit there, going about my own business. No one knows, they can’t tell. I smile and continue working and just carry on the conversation.
No one knows how bad it has gotten. I’m fucking losing it, it’s so bad.

213,depression,"For the majority of my adult life (I'm 28 now) I have had issues with severe energy slumps and periods of very low mood.

The energy slumps seem to be entirely random and have proved impossible to prevent over the years (I have tried everything I possibly can to solve it, believe me), and they are also a massive catalyst for my depression/low moods because when I am low energy I struggle to do what I need to do to pull me out again.  
My overthinking due to inactivity increases, causing feelings of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. I often feel immobilised for days at a time because it's much harder to pull yourself up again than maintain momentum.

A couple of weeks ago, after a long battle to ask for some help from GP, I was prescribed Citalopram 10mg (I'm on day 14) and a CBT group course on Mood Management which I start in 10 days

Ignoring my energy dips that don't appear to relate to anything at all (I've been extensively tested for any medical causes, I exercise regularly, when I'm not low energy that is, I try to get enough sleep and eat well, I don't drink ridiculous amounts), the actual depression feels quite situational. The low energy causes me to not be able to exercise, to not want to work, to lack motivation massively and feel like life is passing me by as I can't work towards personal goals, and that is what causes the depression mainly.

If I am going through a good patch or something good is happening like I'm on holiday, I am usually fine and don't feel depressed at all, but when I hit a slump I spiral into a deep depression. Obviously life has it's blah moments, I can't expect every day will be exciting...

My worry is that maybe I don't have depression and that no treatment will help me. My depression is often triggered by low energy/motivation which doctors have never been able to find a cause for. I know low energy/motivation is a symptom of depression so maybe I DO have it but I'm just not sure, as it's sort of self diagnosed. I kind of WANT to have it just so that I can get better with help, if I haven't got it, I'm worried things will always be this way

I am also aware that I am approaching the 2 week mark of Citalopram and worrying that they won't help me and I really need help because I can't continue with my job search whilst I feel so low which is making things worse for me

I can't stay fully awake for longer than around 10 hours. Maybe less than that. In school I'd just sleep through all my classes so I'd have the energy to procrastinate at home, but now I just sleep.

Every summer is like this. It might as well not exist for me. I essentially hibernate. Without school there's nothing for me. I don't have friends to hang out with. I don't have work.

- Feeling happy..but not genuine..

- Feeling angry..but not really..

Started to feel down at first, because I was being bullied and all (year 2008 - 2009), the process was suffocating. At the final year, I managed to come on good terms with my bully. On the year 2010, I started to learn how to smoke, then towards the second half of the year, I started to drink (alcohol).

Year 2011 was the worst, got caught smoking on the school's rugby field. Mom and dad was disappointed. I was treating myself as the disgrace for the family..but I continued smoking for the pleasure.

Year 2014, friends left me alone. So I started a new circle of friendship with a certain group. We played and study lots.

Year 2015, my ""friends"" introduced me to this certain kind of drugs. Meth. 

I got addicted to it for years, till my physical appearance changed from a normal skinny boy to a skeletal boy. I saw my appearance was different, so I quit at the year 2018. Sometimes even after I quit I would be shaking because of the urge to do it again. But I went on, not touching a single piece of the crystals.

This year was okay, I found a crush, but still, I don't know what to feel about it. Being in a relationship is fine for me, I think it's sweet and all. But at the same time, I just don't feel more to it. I feel less, I feel..empty. I'm happy, but I'm not sure if I'm genuinely happy to begin with.

219,depression,"So I am lost when it comes to putting what I’m feeling into writing. See since high school I’ve dealt with depression. Things got really bad towards my senior year when I sent a goodbye photo to my friends with a belt wrapped around my neck about to hang. Since then only one other time I tried to end my life and I forced my hand to either decide if I wanted to die or live or drive through a school front (I lived across the street from a school and was going to drive to a bridge to drive my truck into the lake) obviously I chose life. Which from that point I finally had a grip on things and I kept moving forward more positive than ever. Things got bumpy with a job loss and having to work with my folks while I bounced back but all in all things were going ok. Now things are going great! I’ve got a side hustle that’s doing good, I’ve got a great career, new car, and an opportunity to go to California and make 3x what I make here in Atlanta. But then yesterday happened...........after years of being composed and being the beacon of positivity and taking my blows to the chin and just moving forward I finally snapped. I was in the grocery store when I felt the mask of joy I usually wear slip and shatter on the floor. My head immediately fell into my arms and I was barely able to keep myself up. I felt like a kid who had just lost their parent in the store. And well suffice to say that when I got home things got a little dicey for a minute there. I’ve called in for a mental day from work.

231,depression,"I've been in a terrible spot the last couple of days,  more likely months with brief interludes of happiness. I've been struggling to find a job that'll let me stay in the same town as my boyfriend and pay me enough to pay off my student loans. But I will most likely be moving home to leave with my parents just to be able to pay them off at the end of this month. 

As my deadline comes closer I feel this overwhelming realization that one of the only reason I'm still in this little college town is because of him. We only started dating six months ago, a month after a really bad breakup with my ex. Yet, I survived that to go on to do the one thing I've never once wanted which is to live alone. My current boyfriend's best friends hate me. I don't really hang out with anyone and to top it off I only see my boyfriend once a week and sometimes I don't see him at all. Plus we barely talk and I don't know how to handle that because I don't really have any friends.

I'm starting to think that if I don't get the good paying job I interviewed for last week, it'll be for the best. I'll feel like an absolute failure for having to move back in with my parents, eight hours away from a guy I love with the knowledge that the relationship will probably not last me moving. 

Honestly, I thought life would get somewhat better after I graduated and got out of a toxic relationship with my ex but I still feel terrible. I don't think there is anyway to fix this and I'm just going to be alone for the rest of my life after this. I've just given up hope.

238,depression,"Now first I want to start off by saying that I am not in a crisis and am currently perfectly safe. In the past I have had encounters where my ip has been tracked and I have been confronted by law enforcement because of potential crises. Just reiterating that it would be unnecessary now.

Thank you for bearing through that first part with me, just any encounter would just further complicate this situation.

As I said earlier I'm perfectly safe now and I'm actually doing well. In fact I'm doing better mentally, emotionally, and therefore psychologically now than I have ever before.

The issue is today I got depressed out of nowhere and seemingly for no reason. I was hanging out with friends and nothing happened, everyone was having a great time and I was too until I just wasn't. I've had a history of severe depression in the past but I've been good for years now. As, I dare to say, everyone gets sad from time to time and everyone gets moments, but mine are very low and are often unpredictable. Now today wasn't a close call or anything and it wasn't the lowest point of this year but it was probably the most unpredictable.

I spend a lot of time regretting things I've said and done and hating intrusive thoughts that come in to my head and hating those thoughts usually ends in me hating myself. But I do this almost every day and usually it results in no change to anything of my life or mood but today of all days it made me depressed.

The biggest issue is that I'm afraid of the unpredictability. I'm afraid that some day years and years from now I'll hit a low that will put me in a crisis and I'll have no where to turn in that exact moment and that's all it'll take for me to fall apart. Again I'm not in a crisis so I don't see how any action I can take now would help and I have lots of friends and family who are very supportive and I talk to about everything including my feelings regularly so I have a plan for the future. I'm not talking about any of my new fears yet as I'm still thinking about what they truly entail.

My questions, is it worth worrying about? Any suggestions?

I've thought about how I'll eventually come to my end and I've determined I'll probably die in a freak accident out of anyone's control, die as a result of something I've done (accidentally causing my death), or die because I have a crisis like I've had in the past.

Because the last seems inevitable before natural causes.

I know this whole ordeal might sound stupid to some but I've struggled in the past and I've heard of many people who have had a history of depression and been perfectly healthy (mentally) for years before ""relapsing"" (if that term works for you).

It seems like depression is an incurable disease like an std. You can make it less uncomfortable and make the symptoms go away for a while but you can never fully recover and it will eventually run its course or cause something else that will.

Any comments and suggestions would help. Even just sending thoughts and prayers this way if that's your thing.

But what ever no biggie right? I started to dislike my face. Mainly disliked how big my forehead was. But let's look at the bright side I thought. I got nice hair and balding isn't a thing in my family. Fast forward a few weeks and I get some scalp issue causing my to lose a lot of hair and pushed my hairline up a bit. This caused me to hate my looks so much that I couldnt even look into the mirror. A while later I found a shampoo which mostly fixed it but it isn't a cure. Alright.. no biggie.

 Then I started noticing my wrists and hands. They're the size of an average girl's. Lovely, another thing I can hate about myself and can't do anything about. Hey you know what since I don't like my height and size let's get into fitness! Alright cool. Oh what's that? I have a scoliosis which causes a lot of imbalances in my lifts and causes one shoulder to be smaller en lower than the other. Great... Another problem regular people don't have. But alright let's keep going I guess. Other problem with lifting is my diet. Eating enough is hard for me especially since eating is for some fucking reason a trigger for my anxiety. Another great trait I have.

Fast forward a while and I'm looking less skinny and a bit more muscular. Great. But then you figure out you might go blind someday.

 Our cottage driveway goes right through a forest that is full of mosquitos and other shit bugs. 

The farmers store belongs to a a neighbour, jack, whos one kid is dating my sisters friend., Megan,  I met Megan on a trip to the DR last year. She is very great and always kept me entertained. I throughly enjoyed spending time with her and I can’t wait for next feb so I can see her again.  Jack also has other kids that typically man the store at the end of the driveway. 

Today was the last day at my cottage until the end of July since about 2:30pm yesterday it has been just my parents and I. They typically do work outside and I’ll sit back and do nothing since it’s vacation. While today they went into town for like 5 hours. 

I got bored of playing video games. I was yesterday and I struggled. I have been sad for like a week and have been battling it by keep myself busy with mind numbing games. Today I snapped and realized in about 3 weeks I’ll be up at the cottage again for 2 weeks and it’ll again be my parents and I for most of the time. I need to make cottage friends. 

So at first I took our canoe out. Paddle 15 minutes pass neighbours to see if anyone is out on their docks. Turns out no one is up here in a Tuesday after the long weekend. So I went back inside all sweaty and shit (eww sweat). Played some games another hour before this time deciding to walk my dog to the local farmer store. 

I got about a block away before my parents came back and tucker (my dog) went nuts and didn’t want to continue the walk. So I didn’t even get there.

a few months ago, i moved away. not that far, only a few cities away. i moved away from all of my friends and boyfriend during the middle of the school year. going to a new school was extremely difficult. i made no friends whatsoever and avoided social interaction with everybody. i felt isolated and as if everybody hated me at school. sometimes i was teased by others, which also made things worse. ever since moving, i completely changed as a person. i became super depressive and suicidal. i feel so alone. i have never ever had such negative thoughts before. not like this. it’s summer, and i am going to highschool now. unfortunately of course, a different highschool from all of my friends. i still talk to all of my friends through social media, but it just isn’t the same. i do go to my boyfriend’s house every now and then, but it still hurts. i have nobody. i don’t want to go. i’m so worried about the future. more-so i am worried about my boyfriend leaving me and meeting new girls during highschool. that’s my main issue. i thought about killing my feelings so i wouldn’t have to be worried about him, but i am not sure. i am afraid and i don’t want to be jealous. i am so anxious and stressed about highschool. i can’t be alone again. i have nobody here with me. this distance is the worst thing ever. i don’t know how to stop being sad over the move. it’s been months and i still feel like shit. i can’t get over it. i’m too weak. i’m worried out of my mind. somebody please help me. any advice please. i can’t “suck it up,” it’s so fucking difficult. i’m so lonely. i can’t do four years alone of school. i hate this place. i hate it all. the stress is getting to my head and often i think of ending it all so i wouldn’t be so sad anymore. it really hurts. i don’t see a purpose in life anymore.

266,depression,"I’ve had enough, I’m sick of going to therapy and only seeing my problems get worse with treatment. I lost my girlfriend, my closest friends, and just the other day even my parents forgot my birthday which was coming up. I’m running out of options to keep trying, I know I’m a young guy with plenty of life left to live but who can give me that speech before it’s just that mind dumbing speech that you hear every time? I get that yeah one thing shouldn’t bat you down but it does, you get up you try again and I do, but get hit back down. My relationships were all up and down and maybe that’s what built me up to this point, my friendships starting to crumble as everyone’s schedules become more complicated and they have bigger priorities over you, I understand that. But the thing that hurt the most, the love of my life, the girlfriend I cherished and did everything for that’s helped me left me, got someone else. And here I am standing here thinking I’m better alone but every time I’m alone I question if that’s the case then why does everyone just leave. Life is full of ups and downs and I’ve been through enough to learn that and I’ve been therapy and on medication to know benefits and the disadvantages of going through the motions. I just think with this situation I’m in it’s a dead end. On the outside it looks like I’m fine, “Oh he’s doing great, he has a good job, getting ready for school, he just doesn’t talk as much as he used to, oh but he’s losing weight” I’ve reached out to everyone, I tried talking t my parents about how we should’ve ate better and they kind of just went along with it because now the only thing keeping us together as a family is what we eat and the place we stay. I’m rarely ever home, I’m either working or somewhere peaceful so I don’t cry my eyes out questioning my life’s existence. I don’t know sometimes, I question a lot and I try talking to some people what they think the true meaning of life is and every time it’s never the same answer and maybe that’s the thing that I have to follow something else, but at the end of the day I know what truly makes me happy. And I don’t have it and I won’t anytime soon, and I’ve waited my whole life battling this mental disease trying to find out if I’m better only to be told every fucking time I’m the piece of shit that people scrape off their boot. Sorry, but the only thing I need is just what I used to have and I’ve learned a lot that you can’t chase your past but it was so much better, I was loved, cared for, I gave love, I have care and it was enough, I wasn’t looking for confirmation but I was looking at someone that I could see waking up to everyday and do nothing but smile at them every second they’re around. Now I don’t smile, my friends give me shit when I don’t get out or don’t take off work for them, or question why I don’t pay for their food when we go out. My co workers see me as an asshole and impatient because I don’t like dealing with their childish acts of he said she said drama and what not. I like to think I was a kid for long enough but maybe growing up kind of just became the boiling point and now it’s all boiled over and I’m dealing with it now. Either way, I’m sorry for whoever has to read this emotional rollercoaster of my feelings but I don’t even know what to do anymore. And I have a knife that I’ve used for the past 3 years, it kills me (literally and figuratively) that I have to use it to feel something in my life. I’ve already reached out, and if I tell anyone the real truth I’ll be hospitalized which when it’s against your will it doesn’t really help, I have 2 therapists and I just wanna figure things out but I don’t know when.

Hey big bro,
Remember that one time you took me to the movie theatres to watch Boxtrolls? Or that one time you ordered us McDonald's or a fruit salad (by the way, that fruit salad was the best thing ever)
Or that one time where you played ball with me with that ball that looked like a watermelon. Or when you bought me my first Starbucks coffee. Or all the times I asked you to bring me some candy when you got home from work. Or when I cried when dad left for work. You were there for me. 

My brother took the time out of his day to spend it with my undeserving spoiled ass. Although it wasn't too often, it was more than enough. He made me happy when I needed it most. Without him, I wouldn't be here today.

Hey big bro,
Remember when you stole money from my piggy bank? 

I forgive you. I now realize you needed it more than I did.

Remember when you hit me because I called you a retard?

Remember when i drew a shitty drawing on your bedroom door with a marker?

&amp;#x200B;

I will start with who I am. Indian born but moved to America when I was a baby then moved to Australia. I have Australian citizenship, completed my higher education and am currently undergoing a university degree at a decent uni. I also managed to get an internship at a top American IT company.

&amp;#x200B;

I severely hate Sydney. The infrastructure is bad. It takes me 45 minutes to drive 15km in the morning and on the way back. To get to uni it takes me an hour and if I miss a train, then I have to wait for 20 minutes just for the next one. The metro is now there but that's not near my area. The food is bad and overpriced. The restaurants in the CBD have pretty much the same menu. Shopping centres close at 5pm so no going out on a weekday really except on Thursday where it closes at 9pm. I also have that fear that I am going to get attacked just because of my race. There have been cases where Indian students got beaten up and that there was a lack of policing and reaction in this. I did not feel this when I was in America but I left in 2008 so it could be different. IDK about this opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

I miss my family. Each year I go to India to visit them , I end up extremely miserable when I come back. I see how good my cousins have it atm. Except for one but that's because his boss is a \*\*\*\* but my other cousin loves her job and they work in the same industry. They get to go out to eat so much. The food is so damn good that every time I go to visit. I demand they take me there. Now I know I am comparing my life in a developed country to a developing country. I realise that. I am not delusional. But I just feel intensely lonely and I have noticed how much better it got. I used to hate the country before 2010 but I noticed so much about how it improved and I just question like why am I living in Sydney.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate my job. I hate the work culture of it. My manager is the biggest micromanager every. In every meeting I constantly get interrupted when I talk like he tells me to say this first even when I plan what to say and planned to say it. Then he talks SO GODDAMN MUCH. He has talked like 30 minutes at once. He just basically repeats the same thing over and over when he has his rambling or saying it in a different method. Then the work I manage to complete it easy but then I complete it in a day then I have nothing to do for a week. I basically come to the office just to sit on reddit or whatever cause I have nothing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have friends. I do have a lot of friends but its not as good as it sounds. A lot of them the same race as me like in the region of South Asia. So like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka. They basically hate being their race and are the biggest self loathers. They make me feel so depressed just to be my race. An example of whom im gonna quote ""these white chicks look at us as rapists. We're gonna stay virgins our whole lives."" This kinda reminds me how I am probably gonna die along. Then they are saying how the country never achieved anything and how we are all pathetic. They're basically potential incels and its killing me. Then I got friends who are the kind to insult intelligence and put people down now matter what the intelligence. They are basically insecure.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I am not one of those who are ""spoilt"". I control what I eat and control how many hours I spend on the Internet or gaming. Same for Netflix. I have self-control on being ""satisfied""

Ill post a link to the previous post for better understanding. So I’ve been slowly working my way through it but I’ve come across another obstacle. I want to help my GF get appointments or do whatever she has to do to help her with her depression the problem is....some giving her help adds on to the depression. She doesn’t like the feeling of me doing things for her because she really wants to try to feel independent as that’s a problem that insists on her depression. But I just know at the moment it’s gonna be really hard for her and take a bit of a while. I want to have faith and believe she can can do it but I REALLY care for her and want to help. What do you think I could do to go about helping her without adding to her depression and stress?

I have friends and family who I know care about me but I still feel lonely and I’m only 18 (almost 19). I’m on antidepressants and I’ve been to therapy, both help me, my therapy finished and there was change, huge change and the antidepressants stopped the suicidal thoughts and attempts but my therapist told me one thing, something that is my worst enemy, the main cure I have which I don’t know how to stop.

300,depression,"I'm just going to get this out because I feel like I need to vent it out. I've been depressed since the age of 16. I was in high school and in a long distance relationship. Most people will tell you that won't work out. At that age it's hard to realize that, but I knew that not every relationship would work out. I was with a girl who had a lot of issues herself, and that is how we bonded. I never really flirted with her as much as shared experiences. I'd be lying though, if I didn't mention I was interested in her. Hard not to when you share personal information with someone that you haven't with anyone else. I don't want to get to much into this because there's a lot more I'd like to address. To sum it up we had a very deep and vulnerable relationship between the both of us. We both had shared a lot and depended on each other. Long story short by the age of 18 she wanted to move out to where i lived and start a life together. Being 18 and not out of high school and a part time job worker, i thought this wasn't a good idea quite yet...But the main reason would be because I had a very strong feeling she would fall for one of my friends over me very quickly. She was an ambitious person, and although I was very smart for my age, I didn't show much ambition or purpose. I was a lost soul. Fast forward about 10 years(we remained close friend) she was coming off a tough divorce and asked if she could come out my way. She lived in Arizona and I live in Michigan. After all i know about her and the relationship she got out of i really wanted to be there for her. I'd be lying if i said that i still didn't have feelings for her too. Well my worst fear came true and she fell for my best friend and they took off to Colorado to live a life. From what i hear that didn't work out(financially) and they're, presumably, back in Michigan. This doesn't bother me now but it has a lot to do with my underlying issues of emotional trust. 

Then there is the life I lived at home. My parent divorced when I was 6 years old. I remember it very vividly but to be honest this didn't really effect me much. I don't think i was able to fully comprehend it at the time, but i still had both my parents and saw them frequently so i was happy. That is until my mother(who was my primary caretaker) felt she needed another father figure in my life. She married a man 10 years younger than her who off the bat said he didn't want to deal with kids. Should have been a red flag for my mom. Lets be honest though. My mom had dated several people, some were great, some not so much. Never the right balance of good character and physical attractiveness. Now my step-dad is a smart person, but also very close-minded. This is a dangerous combination. He was also 10 years younger than my mom. She was 50 and he was 40. He also had a daughter that was 3 years younger than me. To shorten this story both parents we unable to agree on parenting techniques. Now both of us were not perfect children. Lets be honest there are very few children that are. I had caused a lot of issues with my long distance calling to said gf above. My step sister was just completely disrespectful and insulting to both parents and myself. Not to say I was a beacon of perfection. The problem lies with how my mom and step-dad came across punishment. My step-dad would like to punish me more and my mom would like to punish my step-sister more.  My step sister was much more of a problem than i was as far as being disrespectful and obscene. She would constantly curse at my mother. I would constantly call my step-dad ignorant because most conversations with him would come down to insults. This caused a hell of a lot of toxicity and issues within the household.

That was all just between the ages of 16-18. There was more also but this all lead to me moving out asap. my step-dad even made it clear he wanted me out asap. Not a real issue with me because i wanted the same. 

Since then I've been cheated on twice(both with my best friend to boot) and I lost a lot of trust with people in general.

I had a great life overall in my 20s as far as partying and making great friendships. I pretty much made my friends my family. I'd do anything for them. There are a hell of a lot of fucked up stories i can tell you that happened but nothing has messed me up more than the toxicity that was my household and the first two relationships i was in. I had such a huge identity crisis at my formative years. A lot of people have this issue. I took a lot of the positive traits from my friends and tried to instill them into myself to form an identity that could help me prove to myself that I was a good person and deserved good things. That never happened though, because it was all fake, or at least that's how i saw it.

I'm now 30 years old and I've always tried to look back and improve on my problems. I have in my mind the most perfect girlfriend I think anyone could imagine. She's so thoughtful and loving and supportive. Everything i needed when i was younger and more so now. However, i still can't help but feel like I'm not enough. I was never enough for my first two girlfriends, who i gave a lot up for, but ended up with them cheating on me with someone who either has the support of their parents to help them through any strife, or someone who was more physically attractive then me. I completely understand them wanting to leave me for something else, but at least tell me that and break off the relationship before you go and fuck the other guy and i find out from other people. that's just fucked up.

I feel suicidal almost every day, although i would NEVER commit it. I can say this for a fact, because i've witnessed my mother attempted it 2 times. One other time was when she was at work and apparently overdosed on some medication. As far as she thinks i only know of the time she tried at work. The other two times was from carbon monoxide poisoning in her car(back windows were open) and the other was an overdose in the bathroom that didn't work out. She doesn't remember any of these situations. She doesn't even remember when i told her i wanted to move out to my dad's because of the chaotic environment. She then said she wouldn't be able to make it without me and implied suicide. How the fuck as a 16 year old was i suppose to abandon my mother and live with my father at a more stable place.

I'm now 30 years old and have more trust in my gf and her family then my own. I've only shared bits and pieces with my gf's family, because i'm scared they might tell their daughter i'm a lost cause. We've been together for 4 years and it's the strongest relationship I've ever felt. 

I'm not really looking for advice but i will read and consider everything. I always try to keep an open mind about everything because I've always strive to improve myself. I only hope that this may enlighten others and show that no matter how bad things get. Never give up! I'm so lucky to have found someone that supports and believes in me. There is someone out there that can help you. They may not be relationship material, but they could just be a close friend. There are a lot of people out there that suffer from other issues.

Continuing the trend of being met with little to no response on this sub, I'm feeling more and more comfortable unburdening myself by sharing my depressive thoughts and experiences here, thanks to the relative anonymity offered by my favorite social media site, Reddit. 

Depression seems like it's boxing me in more and more with each passing day. Every hobby that used to bring me joy, every TV show or video game that used to satiate my emptiness, any day dreaming that brought goosebumps to my skin and warmth to my heart, now grants me little to no emotion. 

I can still see a light in the distance, albeit dim. I feel as though I'm not completely lost, not just yet. I feel as though my screams are as close as ever to breaching the surface. Close as ever to breaking through and coming into the light, screaming *HELP! HELP! I'm being consumed! Get this parasite away from me!* All the same, the dark cloud grows ever thicker, crushing my voice and filling my lungs. It eats away at me, eating nearer and nearer to my core.

I feel stronger and more determined than ever, yet simultaneously completely hollow and vacant. Perhaps the beast is running out of things to feast on, leaving only my ravaged husk to be tossed to the wayside.

303,depression,"I’ve been in this depressive episode for over 6 months. I’m 25 and unemployed with a bachelors degree. Before this moment, I’ve worked and gone to school since I was able. I’ve been seeing a psych doctor, trying medications, IV Therapy, Fisher Wallace Stimulator. 

I do feel better. I don’t have anxiety anymore. I can’t say I feel hopeless and worthless. I don’t feel like crying all the time. 

The problem is I sleep in every day till 4-6. Really depends on when my mom comes home because I can set an alert when she leaves work. I don’t even get up to eat lunch. 

I removed basically all responsibility’s I have other than take out the trash and occasionally do the groceries. My mom doesn’t charge me anything for rent/utilities/groceries and both my parents occasionally buy me lunch or dinner. My parents are also helping me massively with costs for medication and doctors. My expenses are car insurance/gas and any meals when I eat alone or with friends

I know I’m imposing heavily on my mom and being a leech. I know I need to get a job. My friends and family tell me this basically every day. That this is the next step to getting better. They’re slowly starting to judge me for not having one. Telling me to get my shit together, that I’m feeling better and need to put in more effort. 

But I’m terrified of getting a job. I’m scared of feeling every morning like I have to drag myself out of bed, be miserable on the drive over, and suffer through the 5-8 hour shift doing whatever. 

They’ve suggested getting a night shift job so I can sleep in. A part-time job so it’s not many hours. Working for Amazon, or UPS, or a restaurant. 

But every time I think about applying, I remember how it feels every morning when in wake up under the sheets. How at that point, I want nothing more than to close my eyes for a few more hours and forget everything. Any phone call or text I receive to hang out or help someone with something feels like such a huge inconvenience. 

I never used to be like this. I used to love helping friends. Love going out. I mean, I liked to sleep, but never like this. Sleep has taken over my life. It’s my way of escaping.

either way, this feeling has completely destroyed the way i live life, and has affected my decisions a long way. the horrible thing is, no one around me seems to realize it. (trigger warning) i spent a few weeks so down i did a number on my left arm using scissors and just played it off as a cat scratching me and everyone looked at me, joked that it looked like i actually self-harmed, and didn’t question it once. after that, confiding in anybody didn’t exactly seem like an option given everyone around me treats depression as a joke. 

the worst part is that i have absolutely NO CLUE why i feel this way. i’m not exactly what you’d call a textbook failure. i have decent grades, just acquired a scholarship and have a good circle of friends. but on the flip side, whenever i achieve something good, i can’t help but feel as if i don’t deserve it. it upsets me almost as much as when i fail. and when i DO fail, it affects my mentality in several ways, i can’t pull myself out of the house no matter how hard i try.

my low self esteem has led me to making decisions to paths that don’t let me fulfill my potential, because god FORBID i try and fail again. whatever decision i make torments me and essentially doesn’t really help me in enjoying life at all. being an introvert probably has to do with this, but i feel lonely all the time, even when i’m with my friend(s), and the fear of missing out is basically with me 24/7, even though i don’t even LIKE social activities all that much.

327,depression,"Hello, sorry for any grammar mistakes since I don't speak english quite fluently.

My depression has manifested my mind for about 10 years now. (I'm 23 years old now) I know the reason why I'm depressed, but I don't have any kind of way out or atleast it feels like it.

I got an extremely abusive father, sickness ain't nothing compared to that amount of physical, verbal and mental abuse he has done to me. Basically I got beaten up for absolutely anything I did ""wrong"". For example if I slept, and as soon as I woke up in the morning and the sheets were just a little bit on the floor or not right exactly where they were before heading to bed, I would get beaten up, grounded or humiliated etc. His sister (my aunt) used to say that he shows love in a different way, but what kind of a love that actually is?

I don't have the answers to overcome this hate towards my father. I'm noticing some kind of a anger issues on me also and the worst nightmare is that some day I will become just like this monster which made my life hell. I know these are quite harsh words towards him since his my father and everything but, still.

I feel so weak and vulnerable every time I'm in the same space as him (due to ""family gatherings"" etc. I have to stay in contact with him.) My mind is going on overload all the time, since I feel like **I need to hate and stay loyal towards him** at the same time.

I've been in therapy for past 3-4 years or something like that. I had an problem with alcohol, but I've successfully quitted drinking. (hooray for that!) But it seems like the therapy doesn't work or the cycle of depression wont go away unless I forgive him in my mind, but how the heck I could forgive for all the tears, scars, pain, nightmares and mental issues he has done to me?

This year has been the absolute worst year for me. I've tried to kill myself 2 times this year due to these mental issues my father caused. My father doesn't know, and somehow I feel like he doesn't give a sh\*t if I told him but my mother knows since I tell her everything.

Contrary to popular belief, depression is more than just being sad and unmotivated. If a person has a hard time getting out bed, someone else may assume that they’re lazy. In reality, that person’s biggest hurdle of the day is waking up to see sunlight.

333,depression,"Hello all, I'm hoping you could help me out with this conversation. 

Backstory: 

I've(25) been dating my boyfriend(27) for about 10 years now, we met in high school. I knew early on he had struggled with depression and anxiety as he communicated this with me very well when we started dating. It was never really an issue in our relationship as I am close to many people who've also struggled with their mental health and understood it would take a little extra support and understanding on my part.

Fast Forward:

In the past year I've noticed his attitude shift more than normal. For example, he has always had really terrible teeth but would make the effort to go to the dentist a few times a year and get whatever work done he could under his insurance. This year, he pretty much refuses to make an appointment with the dentist. I mentioned going to the dermatologist with him (I have to go) and he again, refused. In short, he doesn't seem like his health is a priority. He also just seems disinterested in being around friends, his job, ect. His job is a big stress factor in his life right now to be fair.

As far as our relationship goes, he seems disinterested in me. He'll continue to joke with me and be with me, but he's expressed no interest romantically or intimately. We've gone through periods like this before, but right now I feel pressure like I need to pull us out of it. It just feels like he is not emotionally invested in me right now.

The Main Issue:

Now, I know the issues he has with himself are to blame for almost everything I've said above. When I've casually discussed his mental health with him he flat out refuses treatment and feels it's just something he will have to deal with for the rest of his life. He doesn't want to take any sort of anxiety medication or antidepressants and he doesn't want to seek therapy. I understand that this isn't something I can control. It doesn't help that he has always had a very dark sense of humor and the ""end it"" jokes everyone spouts off, hit very differently when he says them. It worries me sick. He also takes jabs at his physical health saying ""I probably won't make it past 30 anyway"".

Recently I've have a big problem with him not caring about his physical/mental health. We are at a point in our relationship where marriage is being thrown around and eventually, a family. I worry about having a family with someone who won't get the rotted tooth in his head removed, or swears he won't make it past 30. Let alone someone who doesn't seem romantically invested 

Because of his anxiety, there are hobbies I enjoy alone (we do share many together, aside from a few more social ones). I've been meeting new people out and about and it's so hard to not wonder into a ""what if"" situation.

With all this being said, I love him to death. He is my first real relationship and I've never regretted that because I love the man I have. We are perfect for one another and our relationship is (usually) full of laughter, love, and support. I just want him back in the headspace he's had up until recently. It's been difficult handling the extra pessimistic attitude and It's difficult to look to the future when I'm stressed about our day-to-day relationship now. And I feel that this needs to be a serious conversation so that we are on the same page moving forward.

So people of Reddit, please give me some advice as to how I can approach this conversation gingerly. Are there things I should mention or stay away from? Any advice or speculation helps, I really feel like I'm going through a quarter life crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year my aunt called the cops on me while I was at work and I was suspended from work than subsequently fired. I have gone over every detail of every thing about what happened. It wasn't my fault. My aunt called the cops because she has mental issues. I was suffering from anxiety and depression and I was venting to her. To become closer to my family I needed to understand more about my dad, because he died when I was 12. He was abusive towards my mother and no one in my family spoke to me about it. I was suffering to get by in life, to stay disciplined, and to not be distracted by things like my mom's failing health and my uncle's alcoholism and depression.

&amp;#x200B;

I was constantly worried. So I reached out to my aunt and felt like I needed a family member I could vent to. Not a therapist, not a friend, not a friend's family member. I just wanted one person I could talk to. My aunt and I had set up for me to go to therapy. I had gone to a psychiatrist in the past. I didn't take the depression and anxiety pills the psychiatrist prescribed me long, maybe a month, because I felt like covering up my feelings with medicine without addressing any of the underlying issues was a waste of money and time.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I got fired, I had worked at my company for almost 5 years. I worked very hard over my final 2 years, and accomplished a lot. I'm not someone to toot my own horn because admittedly I am not confident enough to do so, but I felt proud that I had done so much. My accomplishments weren't rewarded, and I was struggling financially. I don't live in a great area because I never thought I could afford anything else. Looking back, I think I should have put myself in a better area to live when I had the financial means to do so because the stress of living where I live has affected me negatively in more ways than I can count.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted a promotion so I could move to a single bedroom apartment closer to my family and friends, and so I could afford to get a dog to love on. It sounds stupid, but I felt like that was what I needed. When I vented to my aunt the day she called the cops, I was so frustrated at myself for not trying harder. While dealing with everything I was going through, depression and family issues, I thought just maybe the effort I put into work would be enough. But I have never been good at the corporate ladder climb. My text to her said ""I'm so upset I feel like I could hurt someone right now"". If you know me, as I expect family and friends do, you know I was volunteering with kids at the time, you'd know my father died when I was younger, my grandmother who practically raised me died when I was 17, and that I understood the concept of death. I own no weapons, I have refused to fight back several times while being assaulted...I just don't like violence. My feelings that day cost me my job, and the ability to get another job because all companies check with my former company...they know I was discharged.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago I saw a girl walk by from 25 feet away. I saw her dress twirl as she rounded a corner. For the first time in a while, I can't explain what happened to my heart, but I felt it. Another year went by after that, I thought about her from time to time. But I never thought I should reach out to her because I didn't think I was lovable, or that anyone could love me, and that if I were to get into a relationship I wouldn't be worth the investment for them...and ultimately I would be depressed when they would leave. I was afraid of being hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time I felt like reaching out to my aunt, March of last year, I was also speaking with this same girl I was enamored with. She was an intern, a few years younger than me, at the company I was fired from. I felt like I couldn't say anything to her because of that reason too. It's not like we were born in a different generation or anything, both of us being born early/mid 90s. It was just another excuse, that and my depression, that stopped me from giving it a shot, or talking to her...

&amp;#x200B;

One day an intern I was training came back and said ""some girl is passed out on the ground by the break room. I think they may have called an ambulance for her"". When I asked who it was, it was her. I started to panic, I wanted to do something, anything. I went to the break room and acted like I was getting water and I saw her lying there with people surrounding her. I wanted to rush in and help, or get everyone to back off and let her have some space. She was fine, and I still felt the need to say something. I felt so selfish afterwards because she was fine but I still wanted to be there for her.

&amp;#x200B;

I messaged her on Skype and asked if she was okay. I thought I was being super creepy. I didn't know how else to express my feelings at the time. I was too shy to come up to her and ask, and I didn't want to cause a scene or anything. I felt she would want her privacy. She ended up thinking I was nice for asking, and after that day we would talk daily. One day after my birthday weekend, I felt kind of down and stressed so I took a Monday off from work. She had been wanting to wish me happy birthday, and I couldn't understand why she even cared. I still don't understand why she cared about me.

&amp;#x200B;

The job never mattered to me, she did. I always imagined getting to know her, slowly, at a leisurely pace, becoming her best friend. I wanted to do things with her, listen to her, communicate, sing songs together. I imagined making love to her. So when I was fired, I felt that all the things I wanted couldn't be anymore. I was now financially unstable, severely depressed...a complete mess. Our relationship was just beginning. And to top it off - she was also going through her own life challenges, graduating college and seeing how challenging the world outside of school can be, while also challenging her own faith in religion and trying to maintain her relationship with her parents.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks went by after I was fired. I looked at the way I was texting her recently as I forced myself to go through the last year, recollecting every moment that occurred, like friend's getting married all the way down to random group chat messages with my best friends. The way I was texting her those first few weeks after being fired were without emotion. I don't remember much about that time, because I don't think I was even there. And to some extent, all of last year and the beginning of this year I don't think I was there. During the first two weeks of me being fired this girl and I started to become a lot closer...and I was afraid of that. I knew what I was going through already, and months later I came to find that she was going through a lot too. I tried not to hold her hand as we laid in bed one night...and she felt hurt by this, as did I. This moment was something I imagined in a dream and it was happening. I was so afraid of hurting her that I didn't show her affection, and that lasted all the way through our relationship that ended last December.

&amp;#x200B;

After the hand holding issue, I decided I wasn't going to let anything get in the way of how I feel about her. We kissed the following week, and things were amazing for a short while. I was never truly myself around her. I was never happy even though she made me happy, and I squandered an opportunity to restart my life by being depressed all the time. The way I was let go by the company was somewhat messed up, legally I mean. I got a lawyer and received a severance package that got me through a year's time.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost on a weekly basis last year she would try to do something to get me to get up in the morning and try to move on. She was this strong even while dealing with her own issues. She hid the fact that we were together from her parents while living with them, 50 minutes away from me and from work, under a curfew, and to this day her parents don't know about me. One reason was that I wasn't religious, and the other was that she had issues with her parents and her last boyfriend. She was dealing with a new full time job at the company I was fired from and struggling with working for a big corporation. She has always wanted to help people and make them happy, rather it by being there for them or making yummy food. When I was real depressed in March last year, she made me a pie. No one's ever made me a pie.

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend's ex girlfriend passed away a few years ago. It was an overdose but she left a note on her stating it was because of my best friend. I know he loves her to this day. I'm so afraid now that I will never be able to be who I want to be for the person I love. I worry about my mom and her health a lot too. She is having brain surgery next week and it's very serious...she could die. I have no money, no job, and I am barely hanging on.

&amp;#x200B;

I squandered my opportunity last year to go back to school or do SOMETHING. Everyday I got up, made myself coffee, told myself everything was okay and did nothing to better myself. Everyday the girl I love came to see me like this...and I just wasn't truly happy with myself. I never grieved about my old job, I never tried to fix my relationship with my mom, or my aunt. I didn't try to do anything. And now every day I cry before falling asleep and wake up so saddened by my reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I dream about the girl I love on a weekly basis. Sometimes the dream consists of a challenge I have to solve to get to her, and at times those challenges are impossible to solve and I never get to her. Though we broke up last December, we began talking again in late January. Eventually we began to kiss again, and talk on a daily basis, but I knew it wasn't going to last and it hurt me the whole time. I never wanted to move on from her, I never want to move on from her, but I know she was hurting the whole time too. I don't know how to let go of love, because love is all that matters to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to go to therapy last year, but it was going to be expensive and I couldn't get health insurance. My psychiatrist I saw that prescribed me depression and anxiety pills had written in her notes I was an alcoholic, which is undoubtedly a lie, but carriers would not insure me. That alone was enough to make me give up on trying further. Any obstacle was enough to get me to give up last year. In many ways I had given up on myself. My girlfriend was my crutch and kept me going, like a broken vase held together by glue.

&amp;#x200B;

Only recently have I shattered, and I am shattering while seeing her exit my life. I began to face everything that happened to me head on in May of this year, an entire 13 months after it all occurred. And at the beginning of June, the girl I have been talking about told me we need to stop speaking. At this point, the severance is gone, my savings are all gone, no job has been willing to hire me, including jobs at places my best friends work. I barely eat, and I am a burden on everyone in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

When she told me we should stop speaking, I was having issues breathing. We both have gone through so much together, including things like me absolutely believing she had pancreatic cancer and having a complete mental breakdown about it, only to find she is a hypochondriac. We've shared so much with each other, but I've never really been there all this time - I want so badly to be a healthy version of myself with her. I couldn't handle what she was saying to me...she told me about how she handled losing her ex in the past...and I handled it similarly last month. I told her I couldn't do this right now, I begged her to not do it. I shouldn't have put her through that.

&amp;#x200B;

When I felt my weakest, I told her I was a loser, that I might as well jump off a bridge. She texted my best friend's wife, and not until last week did anyone tell me she had texted her. My best friend's wife, who is my friend, helped her process what she was going through, because this girl I love wanted to call the cops on me. The second time in a year that someone would have called the cops on me, only this time it was warranted. She didn't call the cops on me, and I reached out to her last week to tell her she did the right thing. The right thing being to talk to my friend about it, but if she had called the cops, I would not have blamed her. Life is something you cannot replace, and death is absolute...I've learned this throughout my life. That's why I know I couldn't ever go through with jumping off a bridge, because until the day I am forced to die, I refuse to give in to an absolute certainty, or to make my loved ones cry over my grave.

&amp;#x200B;

Every day I think about my other best friend (not the one with a wife) and his ex that passed away. I love him with all my heart, and I cry about it because he deserves love and thinks it ended with her. I cry because I want the chance to be with the girl I love, without everything weighing me down. I'm afraid she will move on to someone better than me. I look at her belongings that are still in my apartment, and the gifts she's given me. What once gave me strength tears my heart apart, yet I don't think I could live without them.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to go back to college this Fall. I graduated already 5 years ago with a bachelor's degree, but this time around I want to learn about something I think I am passionate in. All the same, I don't know how to go on without her. I have always been so emotional, and so stubborn. I have kept all my feelings inside for a long time. I am just now seeing a therapist at the help of my grandmother, my aunt's mom. I am just now reaching out to my aunt about what she did to me, and she told me I deserved it all, and she never apologized. My aunt said to get another job and move on...but no job will hire me, and I know that, but I haven't stopped trying. I have to face my reality. I have always blamed myself for how I handled getting fired, and not my aunt.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what else to say. I am worried about my mom's health. I am worried that I won't find a job and I won't be able to support myself. I am worried about my mental health. I am worried about college, that I won't be smart enough. I stopped learning from 6th grade to my junior year in high school because I couldn't see the chalkboard and I was depressed, and this has affected my opportunities in life because I don't know a lot about math. Some days I try to get on Khan Academy to teach myself and end up getting too depressed or I procrastinate and never get anything accomplished.

&amp;#x200B;

More than anything, I just miss her, and I feel selfish all over again, just like I did when I reached out to see if she was okay after she passed out that day at my old job. She is alive still, going through her own hardships, and I still just won't let her be, at least in my heart and mind. We are not speaking or seeing each other but I see her everyday in my heart. I'm tired of being sad, but I love her. I mean I really, really really really love her. I love her so much that I feel stupid trying to explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know so many other people have life worse than I do. I also know that it's all relative, but I know I need to be stronger. When I think about getting my degree, and getting a job from that degree, and eventually moving to a place closer to my family, friends, and getting a dog to love on years from now...all of that doesn't motivate me. I think I need a lot of therapy and medication, but I don't think it will come soon enough. Because I think about her so much, and the last thing we talked about was how she couldn't be my crutch any longer. I told her no one was my crutch, and I don't want her to hurt, but she was my crutch. I was helping her go through her issues as well, and I know she didn't want to be alone, but I know you can't be someone's crutch forever. Without her I just don't feel like I can ever be the person I want to be. I want to hug her every day of my life and never let go. I miss everything about her, and I wish I had the clarity I have now last year while with her.

What will become of it and where will we be 


I need something to set me free


Perhaps a drug 


Perhaps a hug


Maybe a needle 


Maybe a knife 


Maybe some pills 


Maybe a hill 


I find myself focusing on my hand 


Trying to keep it steady as it shakes 


Another tear rolls down my cheek 


I’m standing in the dark 


A flight of stairs before me


How many stairs are there?


I count thirteen 


Will I throw myself down them


Will I walk away and leave that for another day 


I look at the time 


A bit past twelve 


Cars still ride the road outside 


And streetlights are on 


I step out of my body for a moment 


Say hello to the stars


Say goodbye to the cars that pass by 


I look towards my parents room 


They don’t see me 


Slowly walking towards my doom


They’re fast asleep 


In their own dreams 


Far away from me 


In my mind 


I’m slipping away 


Each and every fucking day 


But that’s okay 


I never wanted to stay 


I go and look in the mirror 


Tryna and give myself hope 


My eyes are red from crying 


There’s bags from not enough sleep 


There’s acne from caffeine that keeps me awake


There’s the grease in my hair 


I haven’t washed for a month


Can’t get myself to do it


It feels like too much 


I look myself in the eye 


Say it’ll be alright 


A tear falls and I wipe it away 


Tell myself I’ll see another day 


Resist the urge to go back to things 


Like cutting my wrists 


And hiding with sleeves 


Walk back to my room 


Sit on the bed 


It’ll be alright 


I get under the covers

That changed with this one girl, I really felt like she was perfect, I could talk to her about anything, and we would have late night conversations that would go on into the early morning hours, on top of this she was so unbelievably pretty. The one thing that irked me though is that she had commitment issues, which she even admitted, despite this I was head over heels for her. One day I mustered all the courage I had and asked her out and she said yes but then canceled. Meanwhile through all this I was talking to my only closest friend, who was helping me with everything. We had hung out as a group a couple times and he really was trying to help us get toghter. I guess my friend had convinced her to be honest and say she didn't want to date, and honestly as much as it hurt I appreciated because I knew to not try anymore or get my hopes up. But then I noticed that they would hang out so much, just the 2 of them, she would talk to him even more than whenever did with me. And one day my friend said he couldn't keep this from me anymore because he said I was still his closest friend and he didn't want to keep secrets and told me that they had hooked up and had sex recently, I can't tell you how much it hurt, it may of been because she was the closest I ever got to finding a significant other, but I think it was the fact that it was my closest friend who had done it, he was the only person I have ever talked about my deepest problems, my deepest insecurities to and now as much as I want to forgive and forget, I can't I just can't. He was basically my therapist he would always help me when I felt like shit. I feel like any of this wouldn't of happened if I had never introduced her to him and that really bothered me so much.

My depression has hit an all time low since I've been home for the summer and away from my college friends and my therapist, who graduated. I've been having some really bad thoughts about dying and cutting/self harm in some fashion. I'm too scared to even ask my Mom to take me to see a doctor to see if maybe some medication might help because she'll either yell at me or just totally ignore me. I also have a family history of mental illness and addiction so taking any medication has always made me anxious. I'm pretty sure the only 2 things holding my life together at this point is my boyfriend and this subreddit.
 I don't think I want to commit suicide because I want to die specifically, but I do want the physical pain and emotional/verbal turmoil to end. I just get so frustrated at myself for even considering it because that means that I'm giving up on my ambitions, and that makes me want to self harm to get some control back in my life. I haven't even started the habit of cutting or anything else and yet I somehow crave it. I've tried everything I can think of to make the urge go away. I've tried prayer, listening to music, painting, drawing, writing, social media, crocheting, reading, talking it over with someone, etc but none of it has really worked to quell the desire to hurt myself. The only thing that seems to keep me at bay is that fact that I don't like pain in general but I'm worried that soon I'll get over that and I won't be able to control myself anymore.
On a side note: I have a really bad recent back injury that triggered a lot of my feelings right now, and my family act really hatefully to me whenever I mention that I can't do something ""normal"" or healthy people can do. I'm just sick and tired of being told from every corner of my life, ""you should get that weight loss surgery so boys will like you"" (they don't know I have a boyfriend already) ""you don't have depression, just stop making yourself sad"" ""why don't you just give up and file for disability since you're too lazy to even try to get a job"" (my family thinks I don't have a job because I don't try. The reality is that no one will hire me around here and I don't even have a feasible way to go anywhere. No car, no money, and no Uber/Lyft in the area).

It's hard for me to talk to people, very hard, even people who I'm close with. Even my parents. I can't imagine talking to them about any of this. Starting off with school and friends, school is so stressful and I'm a mediocore student, at best.

But most the time I can barley muster the courage to talk to them. I think I look like shit, and my nervousness makes it hard to talk to people. After this recent incident I feel like I'm over the edge, I've lost interest in everything I've liked, video games, YouTube, going outside, excersize, talking to friends. I just so badly want to take my revolver put it against the base of my skull and pull the trigger, but I can't, I can't imagine putting my family though that unbearable pain. I also noticed I've been involuntary dropping weight, I've lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks, I just don't feel hungry for days on end and don't eat. I'm always exhausted but I can never sleep. I want to turn to bad drugs so badly I'm so desperate to feel better but I won't let myself. Another thing i with talking to my doctor is that I don't like the idea that it's just antidepressants making me happy, I want to actually feel and be happy because something not bad happened in my life. It really feels like my world that was already been coming crashing down on me is even worse. I just want to feel happy again, or at least not feel so sad it's all I want it seems like such a small thing, but I learnt the importantance  and significance of it.

380,depression," 

I feel like giving up.

I am alone and no one gives a fuck about. I mean, I care enough about myself but if I died, nothing would change. I'm in my mid twenties and unemployed. I'm not upset about being unemployed because I chose to be. I'm not broke or hungry, I just didn't want to be stuck in the previous job. I live alone (with housemates). I'm in somewhat of a relationship.

I feel defeated. I feel like my life is waste. So, cyclical and mundane. I'm just the result of a random egg and sperm cell, who has to bear the burden of carrying on my existence... Just living to pay bills and stay alive.

I'm in my room thinking about offing myself -hanging or slashing.

I think about how inconvenient it would be though for who finds me (probably through the smell of my decomposing body) and who has to do the cleanup and rummage through my things.

Sigh.

I think my parents will be fine. My brother would be fine. My youngest brother is young enough to not understand. He'll just know I'm not around so it wouldn't be a loss. My boyfriend wouldn't care. He'll have enough things to occupy him either way. I'll just become an after thought.

Anyone who's actually overcome their battle (well.. do you ever really?) is probably laughing at my naivety and recalling a time when they may have felt the same way. 

I'm an early 20s male for context. Yet I eel like a child still. Afraid I always will...

I've had dark moments. The darkest was certainly collapsing on the sidewalk of a road that crossed over a small stream, feeling embarassed and invisible as cars drove by in the night. I was leaning against a short wall of concrete made cold by the wintery night, feeling the frostbite consume my ungloved hands, as I called my friends crying that I felt like jumping over or just staying there and waiting for hypothermia to claim me. 

A few weeks later, they briefly stopped communicating with me citing the overwhelming pressure of being my only outlet. Was it the best way? I don't think. It will forever hurt not having friends for a month. But it's been three months since, and I just hung out with them yesterday. Had a lot of fun for half the day. Was feeling normal. Was feeling that *they* thought I was normal. Was feeling like one of the guys. I love my friends and always will. Then one of them made a comment about a hang out they had while not speaking with me. Instant mood shifter (I thought I had that shit normalized). 

I shut down for the rest of the night. Became a recluse. I guess I was waiting for someone to just hug me and tell me it was gonna be okay. I always am waiting for that. I get the feeling I'll be waiting 10 lifetimes.

Ended up crying in front of one friend at the end of the night. Some jazz about nobody loving me, about how I'll never be loved by anybody, and how I'm pathetic. Looking back on it, hey, I feel pathetic! Was clearly afraid that this would show them that I actually hadn't made any progress and that I couldn't be trusted to not have a breakdown and make them feel uncomfortable...feel the pressure to turn my day around like always.

My friend told me there was nothing to fix. Not to dwell on this. And next time is a clean slate. Then he gave me a hug (with a small prompt; a few minutes after I suggested a slew of things that would make me feel better). He gently rubbed my shoulder. I don't know why, but that small detail is engrained in my head, and has helped calm me down all of today. I felt so connected to him right then. And most importantly, I felt loved without the words having to be said. Is that just my own wild interpretation? Does it matter? I felt it. I felt like someone who mattered.

Yeah, I had a setback. But it hasn't ruined everything. And I'm still going.

385,depression,"So I’ve been going through a difficult time recently, I was sexually assaulted in December last year and didn’t get support at the time. My work was also going through a restructure at the time and I felt my job wasn’t secure, I stopped sleeping and eventually after a couple of months became depressed.

I’ve started seeing a counsellor to try and improve things for me. Yesterday was the 4th session. I’d had a better day, been out and had coffee with a good friend I hadn’t seen for a long time and had quite a nice day. I told her this and she said that you can distract yourself but you’re not dealing with your real issues. Then she wanted to talk about a dream I had had. She said that I was all the people and objects in the dream and her interpretation of the dream was that I was running away from my issues and not facing them.

I left feeling much worse than when I arrived and I can’t see how this is helping me at all. Today I’ve been really confused and not sure what else I’m mean to be doing.

389,depression,"Two weeks ago my psychiatrist gave me a scrip for an MOAI, after years of bad reactions on SSRIs, then went on vacation with a phone appointment set up (for today). When I went to fill the scrip the drug info sheet the Rx provided had quite a few points of concern that the psychiatrist had neglected to mention (diatary restrictions, problems with known family medical history etc). I didn't get it filled and made some notes to bring up when we were going to talk on the phone so we could address these concerns.

The psychiatrist called today, way outside the time window she had given me so it was a rather groggy answer as the call had just woken me. She asked how things were going on the new med. I told her I didn't fill it. I talked with the pharmacist for nearly 45 min about things she haden't mentioned and I wanted to talk- she inturupted me going into a rant about how they had no right to talk to me about the medication and how she was going to call them and chew them out. I interjected that **I** decided not to take it until we had the oppertunity to talk and go over a couple points to which she hung up on me rather forcefully they way only old cord phones, like the one in her office, could achieve.

Five min later there is a blip that I have a voice mail (direct to vm so the phone wouldn't ring). It's her telling me that not taking this medication is a huge mistake as *I* need to be taking something even though I always react badly to medications.

413,depression,"I've been debating whether or not to post this but decided why not. Might as well get it off my chest.

About six years ago, i made a friend in school and we immediately hit it off. We were best friends for two years until my grandma decided to uproot my whole life and move us out of town 7 hours away because she thought the city was to busy. Those two years i had that friend (I'll call him J) were the single best years of my life with no contest. He had this aura around him that made it so you couldn't help but feel happy and uplifted by just being near him. He never knew about my condition but was still as nice to me as anyone else. (Sorry I'm starting to ramble. Basically, he made me happy for the last time i can remember). Fast forward four years and i had finally had enough of my grandmas shit and left. At her house, i just felt like she only kept me around cause she had too. I came to live with my dad instead and life was so much better but that's not the point. I've been here for six, no seven months now and just been overall better. No one in my life knows my condition but it's been getting better. My only issue is that i am not even 15 minutes away from my old friend but can't say hello. I freeze up or chicken out any time i go near his home. When i left it was sudden and I never got the chance to say goodbye or even tell him.

Two nights ago though, i had a dream and though i don't remember much from it, i do remember him being in it and us having the best time ever. I woke up from it and realized just how much i miss having him in my life. I layed there in bed for a good solid hour before i even considered moving and getting up. It was Canada day and i had to go downtown later to watch the fireworks with my family and for some reason, i only really focused on the crowd of people hoping to possibly see J among the hundreds of people there. I knew I wouldn't and in the end I didn't but I couldn't help but hope. I came home and just layed in my bed for half the night. 

As I'm writing this I'm realizing just how stupid it all sounds. Seven more days and it will be a full four years since i saw or spoke to him last. Sorry for wasting your time. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading to the two of you who did.",Had a dream and woke up feeling horrible.,1562130015.0
414,depression,"It's so bad and there is so much stress trapped in my head but I don't know how to get rid of it.

&amp;#x200B;

It started a week ago. I started school again. The first day went pretty good. But the next morning, I wake up, with a total mental block and the inability to leave the front door. I did everything else. I got out of bed. Managed to get myself ready...But when I went to open the door, my hand just froze before the handle. I ended up not going, and the guilt ate me up, saying that i'm lazy and just don't want to do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

It all comes down to social anxiety...Before going back to school I was and still am an introverted person. I can only manage going out once a week otherwise I will drive myself crazy. I am constantly frightened people are looking at me, and think negatively.

&amp;#x200B;

If something bad or shitty happens, I constantly analyse it for weeks and weeks and weeks. What could I have done better...How much better it would've panned out if i'd had done it this way...e.t.c.

&amp;#x200B;

And today someone attacked me and called me worthless on facebook. Which hasn't helped anything.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, here I am, up at 2AM, unable to do sleep or do anything about the constant battle with my own mind. I could go for a walk, and it would feel ok because there is no one around, but then there is the anxiety of it being dark and also worrying the hell out of my parents, which I don't at all want to do. I feel so frustrated and wish I could smack something really hard, but I can't because i'd make a hell of a noise.

416,depression,"Long story short, I kind of had to raise myself and I didn’t do a good job—ended up very narcissistic and selfish and had very low empathy or consideration for others. Happened all while depression was getting worse and worse (ages 10-17). 

I kept losing friends, which was done more purposely by myself as I got older because I didn’t believe anyone even genuinely liked me; that they were going to leave me when they got too tired of me like many other people had done before. I was very content with being a loner and in some sense preferred it that way, even though deep down all I craved was some actual intimacy. 

I would always think of myself as some pitiful victim. I could never learn why so many people didn’t like me. Being how arrogant I was, you can imagine why I never self-reflected. Yes, my life in general has never been very great at all, and I’ve been quite unlucky with friendships and relationships, but it’s no excuse for being so intense with the way I behaved and thought. 

I’m 18 now, trying to get out of this bottomless pit known as “major depressive disorder” with not much luck. Only within the past month or so have I come to terms with just how shitty of a person I’ve been for a very large portion of my life. 

The biggest issue for me now is that I desperately want to change, but all these terrible behaviors are habit, and they’re what I instinctively turn to in any problematic situation. Hell, I stress my boyfriend out to death with the borderline-abusive ways I act towards him. I want to stop. I realize what I’ve been doing and I feel so fucking bad for it all. I’ve been trying my best this past month to become a more reasonable and better person. 

If any of you have tips on changing for the better, I’d love to hear them. I’m very, very done treating people like this.

I had been dealing with these issues for some time, and managed to get better last year, and apart from some anxiety attacks I was really doing well. 


Until now. Due to my insecurities and fears I always try to give 105% of myself. I was involved in some volunteer work with the organization I found really cool, their people amazing and smart, and it really helped to stabilize my mental health.


I was happy, and when they offered me an official job position, it really felt great and accomplished. But two months later I feel overworked and not being able to get all the tasks within the deadlines. 

The job is ok, people are still ok, but I'm just tired. It's still an 8-hour job, with rules and guidelines, the pay is not great, and my personal life suffers.

432,depression,"Tl;dr- I pushed away my friend in a depressive episode, and she has left me, most likely for good.

Last night I was talking to her, and my anxiety promted me to ask her if she really wanted to be my friend. She was honest. She said that she couldn't support me and lift me up the way she could before. And that was fair. But then she told me how proud she was of me with how hard I was working to get better.

... then I got incredibly self-destructive. I began telling her I haven't gotten better. A med change is all that has been done for me. I don't know why, but I'm resistant to getting better. To prove this point to her, I told her I was discharged from an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) because my therapist said I wasn't listening or taking her advice. She told me she was incredibly dissapointed and that I broke her trust, since she was only staying my friend because I had promised her I worked on getting better. 

This is when most people try to make things better. But I... kept pushing her away. I told her that I would never change, and that I would just keep dragging her down. And that if she blocks me, she better do a good job, since I'm bound to come back.

Here I am now. Three weeks without suicidal ideations, and they're back to being regular. I could've said nothing, and she would've stayed. Not only did I speak out, I made things so bad, that she made it clear she never intends on talking to me ever again. Shes blocked me everwhere, just like I told her to. 

I don't know why I do this. Despite what I told her, I *was* getting better. But I went out and destroyed the most important reationship in my life, and I will probably be miserable every single day until I move on from her. It feels like a fucking breakup, except platonic. 

I genuinely don't know what I need to get better. I don't know how or if I'll ever get better. I don't see an end in sight. Maybe I'm correct, I'll never change. I'll hit rock bottom, and then just keep crashing down below it. I've already been on psychiatric hold once, and hospitalized twice. Getting better doesn't seem possible to me anymore...

440,depression,"When this year started, I had no clue that life was going to change this much. I expected another normal year with me trying and being depressed like the last few years have been.

In January, a few things happened and I decided to give my life a last chance. One year, that's all I gave myself. To be positive, to think positively, and no matter what happens, I'll keep moving forward to where I wanted to be in life. 

I started taking care of myself, mentally and physically. My health has significantly improved, and eating habits, exercise habits, sleeping habits have all gotten better. I didn't start all this from day one, I did them one by one. I have lost over 40 pounds since I started working out in February.

One of the things that motivated me was the perfect plan I had laid out for the year. I had failsafe plans to keep me going, incase one thing failed. I had things I wanted to do, things that I had to get over, the things that killed the person in me and started this whole downward spiral over half a decade ago.

Being mad at myself, no matter how unhealthy also helped. Mad at myself to not be able to speak to people, for not being confident enough, and for failing my younger self and not doing the things I loved. 

It's been fun, I've been the happiest I've been. The plan obviously didn't work out the way its supposed to be. 

Met the girl I liked and a few weeks ago told her I liked her. She was one of the reason that kept me going, even though I shouldn't have confessed to her until the end of this year. Things changed, we became good friends and well shit happened.

She likes me back, and last few weeks have been I have been the happiest I have been in years. Things were not all good, they got bad as well, but I kept going. Yesterday she decided she needed some time off to think and deal with her problems. Not the first time she brought up the topic, she kept suggesting we continue being friends because she didn't want to hurt me but I knew she liked me back and wanted to be with me. I told my good bye to her yesterday, giving her the space she needs. 

One of the reasons I am writing this post right now is to remind myself that life has its up and downs. My plan maybe fucked now, but I don't need the perfect plan to keep going. She might come back, might not. Thinking about it is scary, hoping for it will kill me.

My parents would be really supportive and give me all the help I need, but I already have a gifted but troubled little brother and I don't want to give them any more worries. That's why I'm writing this.

I could find myself a  psychiatrist, but I don't have the willpower to. I have a really ugly, clearly self inflicted scar on my forearm. It makes me so ashemed that it's unbelievable. I feel like every people sees it and thinks...well, it's obvious what they think. I want to remove it so badly, I found online a good surgeon here but in a whole year and a half I never managed to convince myself on taking an appointment. This, alongside with the study thing and what's on the next paragraph, is what makes me the most disappointed in myself.

I can't help but feel whortless, a useless being not even capable of doing something that will for sure make him much happier (like removing the scar). And the worst part is that I feel like I'm wasting a life that someone else could have appreciated way more than I currently do. I really feel like a waste of a spot in a good family, a waste of time for my friends, a waste of a place in med school. There are so many people that deserve my life way more than I do. Or rather, that would make a way better use out of it.

I was complimented when I was younger for my looks, but around 12 years old I became a recluse, developed terrible depression, and became an outcast in society up to even now (I'm 21).

475,depression,"Throwaway in case someone finds this 

A little background, I’m 19, on sertraline/Zoloft since I’m 15. Both of my parents have/had depression (one lost the battle). My other parent isn’t a great help. I did cut myself quite some times, but now I’m up to something... different...

I did ketamine the first time roundabout a year ago. A small dosage, nothing too special. 
However, every time I did it (4-6 weeks in between) the dosage became higher. A month ago I got to the point, where I could ""detach"" the part that hates me from the rest of my consciousness and talk to it... it was a really interesting way of dealing with myself. 

However, this is ABSOLUTELY NO ENCOURAGEMENT TO DO THIS. Simply because of (a lot of reasons. I can’t really recommend anyone getting into this. But especially) the next part: 

a week ago and said month ago I did the mistake of taking ketamine while I had a pretty hard down phase. 
It did made the down more bearable, but that’s what I feared. 
The last week was kinda fine, but the last days were terrible. And every time (even in the okay-ish week but especially for the last few days) I’m feeling even a bit down, I have the urge to do a lot of ketamine. Like, I don’t even care if it kills me. I just want to dissociate from my body, my life. Nothing like ketamine made my feel that way. Well, at least not that easy... I don’t think I’m really addicted (yet). I can survive without it, and i dealt with quite some stressful situations without it... but it feels so relaxing to not feel my empty body... my empty head... and I really want it...

My psychiatrist gave me some stuff to take instead when I’m feeling suicidal, but those are all terrible (not like ""in comparison with ketamine"", but even before I tried ketamine, I hated those)... so it seems for me this is my only escape from my miserable reality. Even though I know it’s not good in the long term... 

Anyone got experience here with getting addicted to drugs (especially ketamine) during depression? How did you get out? What medication could I ask my psychiatrist for, to get something to ""imitate"" ketamine (to get away from the illegal substance)? How do I not get deeper into this? Because I don’t think trying to resist will help for long...

In my field this position is highly coveted and in a sense leads to competitive placement in further training or job offers. But the year was a disaster. Overnight I became a social outcast for reasons I couldn't understand. A whole department of people treated me like a pariah. Later in the year it came out that one (possibly more) of my co-workers seemed to have been subtly turning people against me. Would say things like I was making fun of her husband for his medical issues (which is ridiculous and a fabrication). But for some reason, everyone got their pitchforks and socially ostracized me. I moved on to further training after a year.

Since then, I've found myself extremely distrustful of people. I get very anxious in mild social situations to the point I withdraw/avoid. I no longer talk to friends, hang out with anyone, play basketball, or text/call. Fast forward another year, finished first year of training, everything is worse. I enjoy nothing anymore. I avoid going home, but also avoid doing work. Coworkers think I'm a joke. I'm bullied, made fun of, told to ""fuck off"" at times, used as the end of practical jokes where I'm the one who gets in trouble. My wife left to go on a trip with her friends on my birthday, which happened to fall on the first day off I've had in weeks. I've become someone that everyone doesn't care about kicking around.

488,depression,"This is one instance, but it upset me greatly. We (my best friend, my second eldest brother, my eldest brother, and myself) were playing Uno and having fun, and my eldest brother (who is about eight or so years my junior) kept calling me school shooter throughout the game. I ignored it initially, not easily, but I did. But he just kept calling me it. It got to the point where I was already frustrated with the game and sick of getting called school shooter, so I just said ""Stop calling me that. It seriously isn't funny."" So, what would any good older brother do in this situation? He called me it again. So I said ""Dude, it's not even funny."" Then my second eldest brother chimed in and mumbled ""School shooter"". I was severely upset at this point, so I layed my cards down on the table and said ""I'm done"" and walked away. That's the end of it, right? No, of course not.

My best friend is the only person I can usually feel solace around, knowing I don't have to fear the possibility of my feelings being crushed. This just proved that it isn't the case. He made fun of me with my brothers. It really, really hurt. I feel so alone right now. Nobody was there to defend or make me feel better. It was all just calling me names and stuff. For all I know, my best friend talks about me behind my back all the time. At this point, I wouldn't doubt it. My eldest brother eventually came in the room and said sorry, saying he wouldn't do it again. I said ""it's ok, just please leave me alone.""

Fast forward to today, turning 23 real soon, I finally got my life together and have been getting my medical stuff done, last year I had to to extract one tooth due to it being broken since middle school, failed root canal for one time my parent finally took me after days of pain and crying, and begging. Now, I have to get two more extracted. I am so heartbroken, I've always religiously brushed my teeth but none of that helped since the damage from childhood was far too great. My teeth are too weak for cavities from sweets so that's another thing I have to give up even though I don't always eat. They have to sedate me after I figure out when they'll schedule it, extract two teeth then finish up the rest of cavities from when I continuously vomitted for a good 3 years due to illness. ☹️ 



TLDR; 
1 tooth extracted, now 2 more as adult despite religiously brushing, flossing, and mouthwash. 
Most of the damage from my teeth were from how sick I got and my parents failed to take me to get better back in childhood that now as an adult am suffering from their negligence.

493,depression,"I ask myself every day.

Why am I even doing this? How did it even get this bad? Why can't I have the same passion as I did back then? Who am I doing any of this for? 


More questions. I wish I could go back. It's been 3 months since I started working full time since graduating high school 4 years ago. In that time, I've met dozens of people, making many temporary friendships. I've traveled hundreds of miles, and spent time with friends I'll never see leave my life, all over the states. I've learned new skills, gained new hobbies, and spent a lot of time learning about myself and what I don't want to do after I get out of school.


But most importantly, in those past few years, I've failed. Failed miserably. Completely, and utterly, bombed the chances I had of floating my way to my degree. Now I live with my parents, work a full time job making $10.50 an hour, and have no time to pursue my hobby. No time to pursue my career. No time to invest in meaningful relationships in real life. No time to properly discipline my mind so I can properly take care of my body.


I failed for the last time last fall, when my grandmother passed away. I didn't recover academically, and lost access to financial aid. Technically I can get it back, but not all of it. I've been failing before for 3 years but am 70% complete with my degree. I am 30k in debt, and owe $400+ a month in loan repayment until I go back to school. But I don't know how I can afford to go back when I've failed so hard. 


I failed because I didn't have the will to stay the course. I delude myself that if I wasn't killing my will to live and thrive and achieve my goals by grinding myself into this full time job I hate, I wouldn't have any of the problems pursuing my goals. 


But I failed before without the 50+ hours dedicated to my job. I failed before I finally found a fulfilling hobby that made me feel happy and gave me a purpose and reason to get up in the morning. I failed to keep my passion for that hobby alive while working the job and trying to stay positive.


I do nothing but fail. I have my parents as witness as they see me break down over simple things every month and scold me for not appreciating how lucky I am and making the most out of a shitty situation like they have their entire lives. 

I have my only real life friend as witness as he works next to me every day at the job he got me hired at, trying to act like I care but doing the bare minimum in hopes that I can squeeze on by until I can go back to school in spring.(another delusion I have)

I have my dozen or so friends I used to DM for weekly as witness ask constantly cancel sessions and stress to them about how stressed I am, and how little time I have to dedicate to the hobby.

I have every person that enters my life as witness as they see me go through these moments at random and unfortunate times and simply disappear because they don't want me. 

I have myself as witness as I waste away my free time laying in bed or playing videoganes, motivationless, until it's time to drag myself back to my stressful and draining job, pretending that if I just Survive long enough things will eventually sort themselves out. 


I fail every day and ask myself: what am I even doing anymore? Who am I even surviving for ? Will they even accept my failures when I find them? When they find me? 

When will I stop failing? When will the passion and motivation come back? When will I wake up every day and perform every action with purpose?

507,depression,"I know, atleast for me, this is one of the hardest things to rationalize and justify doing, but I can't ignore the obvious effect it has on me when I do. I couldn't begin to tell you how it makes things better because I don't know and it very legitimatley does not. All I can say it definitley does is serve as a fleeting distraction from mental pain, making you focus on the physical. But that doesn't explain the genuine euphoria and relief I feel when I do those things. I don't know if thats how other people feel but I've finally found a real substitute that gives you everything you want out of self harm without any violence towards yourself. Im very probably not even the first person to say this here but you just need another physical diatraction that over stimulates your senses. Specifically for me, every time I've wanted to hurt myself for the past month I've just thrown myslef on the ground and done push ups and sit ups until I literally can't continue. Use any exercise you want, as long as that shit starts to burn. It very much is still hurting yourself in the most literal way, the pain youre bringing on yourself however is productive and benificial. And I can whole heartedly say that the euphoria I feel is so much stronger and deserved. Get down and physically use your muscles to climb out of the psycological hole you're in. You'll recive your catharsis and better yourself in the process. Like a controlled burn in a forest so it can come back more lush, youre doing less harm to yourself for more with a clear goal in mind. Instead of just razing the place and hoping to get what youre after. So when you want to ache for whatever reason, just push yourself past what you think you can do, and there wont be any room for bullshit in your head.

So it all started with overdoing it on eating an edible about 3 week ago. I took a 30 mg edible which by the way I hardly smoke so it’s very rare.

513,depression,"I can't connect with people. I always thought that this was bad and unusual and strange, but once I broke down and talked to my other depressed friends, I found out they felt the same way too. When I say this, I mean that I feel hollow about my friends. I don't care about them much and if they died I don't think I would be very affected (of course until the day that it all hits me in the face and I can't repress it anymore). It was just information for me when my depressed friend said to me that she didn't care about me either and didn't expect the same from me. She said that she would support me and she knows I would do the same but the connection is not there. We stay together as ""friends"" because we need each other sometimes when we are unhappy and we know that having is friends is what you are supposed to do. I know I'm repressing the emotions tied to when she said she didn't care about me, but I can't really stop so I just roll with it. In case you think we aren't friends in the traditional sense, it's all the same except the emotional connection. We hang out, help each other, talk to each other daily via text and call, and try to have good times together. The problem is that we are doing it all with no emotions for the other person. It's the difference between loneliness and being alone. We aren't alone, but we are very lonely. We thought being with other people would lessen that, and maybe it did and we just don't realize.

I have emotional connections with my family, but maybe that's because I'm around that so much that I just got used to them always being there. I love my brother and my sister and my aunt I think I love my mom and I know I love my dad. That last one is an issue because he's a depressed autist and we can't talk or communicate for jack shit.

This brings me to the point. I want to find a guy who I'll make family. I'm gonna marry this guy and we are gonna have sex every day and travel around and cook for each other and have a lot of cute little babies and be each other's best friend. I want to fall in love with my best friend and then I want to make him family. But how do I have an emotional attachment with a friend at all? How do I make them my best friend? How do I progress to a point that makes me want to have them join my family? I'll love him if he's family but I want to love him before that point, and even if I didn't care about that it would still be important to sustaining a relationship with him.

And if I get that far, what will he think of my mental illnesses? That phrase by itself is just bad news brewing. It's a writing prompt for a horror story-- ""what will [romantic partner] think of my mental illnesses?"" That opens the door for violent schizophrenia or strange bipolar disorder when in most cases schizophrenics aren't violent and bipolar people just have very very quick and intense mood swings. And that stigma just sorrounding the phrase demonstrates my point. What will he think of me? Will he fetishise my depression and anxiety like those fuckers on the internet or just think I'm joking. What's he gonna say when he sees my antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. What's he gonna do if the mom of his kids can't get up in the morning to help his children get ready for school, much less kiss them on the cheek? What's he gonna think if I tell him what it's like? He would leave me if he's sane. Maybe there's a guy out there willing to put up with my shit because he loves the rest of me so much (but why would he even do that?) but this is 2019. Realisitically, unless he wants to give himself a pat on the back for marrying a crazy lady he, this is fictional man who sounds so good hell get a pick of anyone he wants, he won't marry me.

What I really need to understand is how to be independent again. How to feel like im able to be alone, but not be lonely. 

Ive talked to multiple close friends and theyve all said that I should just drink, smoke, party. I really dont want to fall down that path because I know the moment i come off that high the moment i become sober the moment the party is over? Im gonna be the same if not worse. Im not in it for a short term recovery, I want to be able to improve myself and better myself not only for whenever I meet another lover, but in general for myself, my family, my future. 

Im going to be honest the way I am right now I dont necessarily fear being alone, but I also do. My close girl friend asked me why do you not want to be alone? You’ve always been the type to work perfectly fine alone, be alone, and do things ALONE. Then i thought well really I dont want to be left alone with my thoughts.

But im sacred of the fact that when i start to try to fall asleep my thoughts will keep me up. (Please feel free to leave any thoughts and advise on how to overcome that feeling) 

I really do want to get better. I really do want to be able to wake up everyday to say that im independent and that I really dont’ need another companion to make me happy. It all starts with self love, but how do I start to love myself? I really have been boosting my own confidence saying that Im the best she’ll ever have, its her loss, im a great guy she took me for granted, etc all the self loving boosters you can think of. But i still feel like it isnt necessarily helping so thats why im reaching out to all of you to wake me up and realize that I can get through this, and that I am fine all by myself and that I dont need another person to make me feel special. Trust me i do understand that its all progress, and that I wont be able to just say im fine and then be fine, but does repetition truly help?

537,depression,"So I’m on my summer break from college. My mom was comparing me to my school’s students who are oreintation advisors after she saw an FB post about them. She went and said how they’re doing something with their life and I’m not. During the summer the school employs students for the new student oreintation. Its a leadership position. And to get most leadership positions you have to be known or a favorite. Which isn’t fair because there could be unqualified people in this job. 

Anyways, I’m going into my junior year and I am majoring in cyber security and my minor is in computer science. I work at an IT help desk at school. I love my job there and I feel like it’s my second home. I have such funny coworkers who make my day.   

I’m not saying that these orientation advisors are unimportant because they are important, but being an IT assistant at my school is a much more harder and demanding job. We deal with professors and students. It feels like no matter what I do to help others, I never get a thank you and I can’t be put on a pedestal since I’m no “student leader”. Starting next semester I’ll be a club officer for my school’s cyber security club where we learn ethical hacking skills.  So that’s at least a leadership position that will be helpful to me. 

I struggle with depression from day to day. I feel insecure  a lot and i feel ugly. At times I don’t even feel appreciated. I went to vocational school for IT and I was put down there a lot for my choice into going into the IT shop simply because I’m a very feminine girl and still am. Since then, I’ve always had this sense of worthlessness that no matter what I did, I would never be important or do anything big enough. 

I often feel like I won’t do anything big or important enough in my future. I want to work in the aviation industry or the government for cyber security work. Right now I work at a dollar store for the summer and it’s the worst place ever. It’s hard finding an IT job at my age unless it was like an internship or an entry level job, unfortunately none are around me at the moment. I do have a certification that’s good for an entry level job. I’m considering leaving my dollar store job because i feel like I do not have the brain to be in retail. I’m around so much negativity I feel so bad about myself. 

What hurts is my mom telling me how I’m not doing anything with my life. My major is one of the hardest at my school and so is my minor. I have a dead end part time job at a dollar store.

After years of treatment after meeting a really good psychiatrist when I was admitted to a hospital I was able to pursue some of my goals.

I applied to university and got accepted to a really good science program as long as I finish the courses I'm taking with a certain average. I am doing well in the courses and will pass with the average I need so I found an apartment to rent near the school. I planned a time table so I had one evening off a week so I could continue working part time at the vet clinic. Things were going really well and I was excited for September.
There was problems with enrolling in my classes though. For some reason the site won't let me enroll in a mandatory class that is only offered first semester. I've tried reaching out to so many people at the university but no one responded to me emails and I got hung up on when I called. I planned on going down tomorrow to get it sorted out. Almost all the labs for the class I'm enrolled in are full. My schedule is so fucked now that there is no way in hell I'll be able to have an evening off.

I have dealt with depression for a majority of my life. Up until about a year ago I was resistant to seeking help because meds did not help me when I was a teenager, and in general seeing someone is costly and time consuming. 

A year ago I started on an SSRI, and it really seemed to help me until a month or two ago. My anxiety has stayed under control for the most part, but my depression is coming back pretty bad. I have contacted my doctor, and am now on a 5 month wait list to see a psychiatrist. I am working with my doctor and my work's HR to get approved for FMLA to not get in trouble time off due to doctor's visits. However I am not sure what to do in the meantime. I don't want to exhaust my friends talking about the problems I'm experiencing, and things that are surfacing after I thought I had worked through them in the past.

I think this may be due to me reducing my activity, and also some personal relationship issues. I have tried to start walking more and push myself to be willing to talk about what upsets me, but it doesn't seem to be letting up. I am afraid that if I don't seek help it will just continue to get worse and 5 months seems like forever to wait. I tried finding someone from my insurance by searching 'accepting new clients' but when I did find someone it was the same story (long wait list).

I realized towards the end I should have dated the girl who liked me and that would have made my senior year great.

My mind always thinks, ""in ten minutes you won't be here"", and then it seems like 10 minutes comes too early and I'm wishing I could go back to 10 minutes before. Nothing feels real to me.

Maybe that's just a disorder. But another thing I feel is just...nothing. Sometimes I just get this really weird emotion that I've been thinking of as just feeling ""gray"". It's not that I don't care about anything, it's that I feel, like, no emotions.  I don't feel tired, but I don't feel energetic. It feels like I'm moving through syrup sometimes, and other times it's like my mind just isn't in the right place at the right time. Feeling gray for me can last from a couple minutes to at most an hour, a couple hours if I'm on my computer or watching TV or something. The first time I felt gray was during an orchestra practice at school, and I went into this zone where I didn't even feel the strain or weight of the violin or the tiredness of my hands. I liked feeling gray then, because I didn't feel tired. But now I don't like it.

I keep fighting to improve myself, trying to get my life in order so I can work again, deal with bullying issues in the past. 

Anyway, introduction aside,

I’ve just been hit by what feels like a massive wave of depression. I’ve never ever experienced something like this. I mean usually it’s a build up.

This is just intense. I’ve been in tears. Normally I just go downhill because of thought patterns. I’m also a bit shaky, I developed a headache. My depression thoughts went into overdrive. When it hit me I just wanted to throw up. It’s stopped being as intense now but it’s tired me.  It just hit me but I did have some kind of little panic attack a couple of days back. But that had a trigger, this didn’t. It just randomly came on and doesn’t feel like my panic attacks. 

My normal depression goes up and down in waves. It’s been a long struggle. I just don’t want it to get worse again.  

Please no discussion about medication. I’ve always reacted badly to antidepressants and I’ve tried all sorts. I am currently receiving therapy, have been to counseling and I use CBT. 

I’ve had depression for years but this is the first time this happened with no prompting (I was seriously ill and nearly 5 years back and was on a lot of meds at a time).

I have no money, no motivation to work, no time to do things that I used to love doing because I am in this small boat and the only thing that I am doing is paddling. I feel like the paddle is slowly wearing off, and eventually I’d have to use my hands until I have no energy left. 

I used to write, keep diaries, have a beautiful body, I had friends, my family was together, broken apart but at least they were all in the same house. I used to go  therapy, I felt like things were going to be okay, always. I had so much hope, so much passion, so much going on in my head. Times were rough but at least I had a routine; I was productive. I did something. Now? I do nothing all day. I had a little hope left thinking I could make it into university with nothing - how delusional of me. 

I’ve gained a lot of weight due to taking antidepressants as well as bingeing. I’ve always had a shit relationship with food.

some brief, basic info on me: 

&amp;#x200B;

since i can remember, i have had anger issues. luckily, my parents both in their own ways have helped me to deal with anger in relation to violence, as i was definitely prone to be violent, growing up. i've learned many effective techniques to deal with my anger, in general, but that doesn't address the root of the anger. while i can have a bit of a temper, my probelm is mostly pent up pissed-offedness (however, my road rage is unreasonable). i have anxiety, and have panic-attacks from time to time, as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

all of this to say:

my wife has always dealt with depression, and i've learned a lot from her over the past 12 years. but, i've never personally experienced the symptoms or signs of depression that we commonly hear about. for the some time now i've wondered if maybe depression is just manifested as anger in my life, so i am here to see if anyone can speak to their experience(s) in this regard.

that was because i met a girl. she wasnt good for me at all. but she made me realize that i was bi and i have a huge emotional attachment to her now. she hit me, forced me to do drugs or else she would break up with me, she cheated on me twice, and constantly manipulated and lied to me. but there was something about her that made me wanna start caring about myself. for the year and a half that we dated, i took care of myself. i brushed my teeth and took showers and worked out. i went back to the student i was before it all started, i made all A’s. i cleaned my room and kept it clean.  i had actual plans for the future instead of accepting that i would be dead by the end of high school. i did more things that i wanted to do. my parents started to become more at ease with me. 

then, she broke up with me. because i was upset at her for cheating on me. she started dating my ex best friend. and for about nine months after, i was okay. i was sad that i didnt have her because i love her so much but i was okay. i still took care of myself. i forced myself to eat even though my body would reject anything i tried to eat for a while. i worked out. i did my schoolwork. (remained a 4.0/4.0 gpa). i kept working towards my dreams. all of my friends told me that this was the best that theyve ever seen me. i kissed who i wanted to and went to parties purely to dance. i got sober, completely :). i got my license.  my room stayed perfectly clean. life was so good. 

but now, ten months later, im sitting in my room. like i have been for the past week. ive been sleeping all day and staying up all night to watch youtube (minecraft videos lol bc thats what i used to watch whenever i got sad when i was young or whenever my parents were fighting). my parents yell at me for being lazy. i started to clean out my closet but i gave up halfway through and now my room is messy again. i have old plates and bowls up here. i dont remember the last time i brushed my teeth or washed my hair. and i keep torturing myself by thinking about her and thinking about how it would be if she would take me back.

I grew to realised that they are not as opened or accustomed to such topic from frequent conversations that touch the subject. 

So, right now, after many months had passed since the day I quit Uni, I have made up my mind that I’m finally ready to start all over again. TBH, I don’t even know how to write out all of the jumbled messy thoughts in my mind. So here it is:
 
My family told me that it’s better that I don’t  continue my degree and help out my brother on his F&amp;B retail business because start-up business is really fragile and need a lot of monitoring and support. Before that , they told me to just made up my mind to go to study any course I wanted , they reassure me on that. Now, they tell me straight in the face that it’s better that I don’t continue my study so that they can use the money or save up the money to invest in the business. I’m confused? Do I even matter?

I spent months and months trying to figure what I want after what you told me before, and now they twist it around? When I confront them about this, they’ll always say ‘things change in life, not everything  will go according to plans’ .

620,depression,"  I'm sorry for my english and syntax, I'm not from England, america, etc. 
  First of all, I created new account so my past lover can't read this. You will soon know why.
  I've been in love with one girl, she is from another country, 7 hours by train away, I know her for 3 years now, I really tried to make her love me, but she loved another man, and she got in relationship with him. After a year of us two chatting I quit and told her to get away from my life. Next year was the worst year of my life, a year of remorse, a year of insane depression. On january 2019, she texted me, said she is sorry and that she was thinking about me all the time. She told me her relationship with him was torture and abusive, he told her she is bitch etc. I helped her to get out of it, she got out and started to call with  me. But her mom is thinking she is bitch 'cause as soon as she left him, she started to call with me and wanted to meet me next month. She said I was helping her through her depression for those 3 years and I was kind to her all the time, even tho it had to be hard for me. We were flirting for a month now.
 ...
  Last week her ex was with her to grab his things and get out. I told her I am worried that she will come back to him, she told me ""don't worry, nothing will happen, never.""
  Guess what happened, last sunday she wrote ""I want to give him another chance, last one, I don't want my mom to hate me, sorry."" 
I'm destroyed, I can't think straight, I hate her, I told her to fuck off and go fuck yourself.
  You feel me? 3 years of me trying and being honestly kind to her and when she starts to love me, she comes back to her abusive ex who doesn't allow her to have friends.
  Yesterday, 1. July 2019, I decided to kill myself, she was the only thing holding my mind. I bought sleeping pills and ate like 20 pills on a shot of vodka. I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye to her. I wrote to her ""If you want to say something before I pass out, do it now"" 
  She freaked out and started to tell me not to do it, that I have something to life for, I didn't care. She told me she is calling my sister, I didnt want my family to know I have suicidal thoughts so I told her I'll throw up those pills, I did. She saved me this time, but I want to try it again today or tomorrow. 
  Should I help her again or should I leave her be? I mean she came back to him so her mom won't call her bitch every time she comes home.

626,depression,"I don’t know why I’m venting here, I guess I won’t get much replies anyway but I just need everything out. I’m 24, I have a daughter plus I’m 7 and half months pregnant with another baby. I’m thinking of committing suicide and been restlessly searching for what overdose would give me a cardio-respiratory failure. I want out. I love my daughter to bits but I’m useless to her and my whole life is a failure. I’ve been thinking about death since I was as little as 6 years old. I guess I had some traumas during my childhood I can’t remember, besides the ones I can tell. My mom was (still somewhat is) an anorexic/bulimic and her constantly throwing up even in front of me left me with bad emetophobia and anxiety plus she was very nervous -probably due to nutrient deficit in her system- and hit me constantly, I remember sometimes she would pull my hair so strong it hurt for days, or she would drag me around the house by my ponytail and it was hell. My dad was often away for work and when he was at home he was abusive toward my mom and me too, for example one day I was like 11-12 and went out with a friend, it was summer and we were wearing a mini skirt, when I got home he started calling me a slut, kicked me until I was on the kitchen floor lying and kept kicking while my mom was washing dishes. He never had/has a good word for me. My character is somewhat bad, sometimes I’m hypercritical and aggressive , I don’t want to blame others for my behavior but I guess I never received love so I don’t know how to give it. I had dreams and ambitions, like acting and stuff and all my relatives always made fun of me still thinking I’m psycho. I was bullied since the first day of elementary school, I have olive skin and facial/body hairs and was called with male names/ made fun of so I hated school too and had very few friends. Sometimes classmates would ask to sit near them and an hour later be like “I was drunk (?) I don’t want you near me”. I’ve always been the spare wheel, the third choice not even the second one. Same for middle school, bullied, treated like crap, I had to hid under teachers desk during breaks to prevent bullies finding me, one day during an event in the school yard a class mate pulled my pants down, when I told my parents they laughed. I was traumatized. I could go on and on for days. In high school I started changing my appearance by wearing colored contacts, dying my hair blond etc and that only attracted the wrong people. I was promiscuous, dated much older guys, got a boob job at 15, pregnant at 17 and had a late term abortion cause the baby’s father left me and told me he won’t ever date a girl who already had a child (his own! Mind you). He was abusive, hitting me, spitting in my face and so on, but so was every guy I had relationships with. From high school psychology classes I think I can tell I chose guys resembling my father. At 18 I was working in clubs, got nose jobs, met a new guy and pregnant again by 20. I miscarried and the guy left me blaming me. I suffered but was back in the game shorty after, worked in night clubs (or basically as an escort), changed my appearance completely with surgeries and fillers, moved far from home, had money, lots of it, friends , was out everyday and night and it was for the first time in my life, for the first time I had everything, I was appreciated, I was not alone all the time, I was one of the top girls in clubs, everyone wanted me in their club and had lots of clients. Had my own home near city center and could do whatever. Until I met a guy, a guy who seemed genuinely interested in me and not only for sex, my craving for love came back. But he was a mess, he did cocaine, used my money, made my boss fire me from work, dated other girls. I was so in love it was too late to walk away, I tried cocaine despite being against drugs, just to demonstrated he could be with me, I worked less and less, I tried so hard to be loved by him, until I succeeded. I moved in with him at his parents place, we had plans. We returned together in my hometown at my parent’s so he could find a real job and detoxicate from drugs. He was violent, one time he even stabbed me with a knife in my shoulder, scar is horrid, but I loved him. He stopped drugs, found a job, got me pregnant. When our daughter was 7 days old we visited his hometown and he disappeared for a day and night, coming back all stoned from coke. I forgave him once again. He found a new high paying job, we stayed in with my parents, sometimes fighting, he even hit our baby by mistake when she was 2 months old, leaving her with a scar. But life goes on, I had a major uterine surgery due to hemorrhages, thought I was infertile and had no more period but then got pregnant again. He was happy. I suffered, and still do. He is out working all the time, I’m at home, he doesn’t care about me anymore, everyone in the house treats me like I’m shit. I can’t seem to keep friends anymore, im nice to people but they walk away so I’m alone all the time. My father almost hit me yesterday cause my mom told him I need to take a flight to go to a clinic for giving birth , he said I’m a spoiled prick, insulted me, almost hit me. Then my bf came, hit me in the face as I was replying to my father and dragged me to “our” room. I could go on for days, I’m tired of surviving. I never killed anyone, never been an addict, never had problems at school, but always been treated like crap since birth. I’m dreading the traumas my daughter will suffer from seeing her mother constantly hit by everyone.

627,depression,"I’ve been depressed ( knowingly ) since I was 11... did normal stuff a maladjusted kid would do- sulked a lot for years until I discovered drugs and alcohol, which eventually got me into lots of trouble ( I know, shocker!)- at 18 I was hospitalized for the depression... all it really did was start a cycle of overmedication and now, I can’t shut my damned mouth ( when I used to keep pretty much everything in)... that’s a double edged sword.. being open had gotten me in trouble too.. anyway- I was rotated through different meds through the course of a year or two ( after the hospitalization) and they all seemed to make me worse. I stopped... returned to bad habits because, well shit, at least I felt better some of the time and when I did feel bad- it made sense, too. 

Eventually tried Wellbutrin again since it was the only med that didn’t make me crazy AF.. eventually I ended up on Wellbutrin for years and quit using party drugs...got a job in the medical field after I quit partying for a while... helping others! Maybe that will lift my crippling depression! Alas, that didn’t work... I work for 4-5 years in my field and eventually I landed a charge at 28 after some family tragedies and hitting a hard(er) spot in my life.. 

Fast forward a bit- I’ve been thrown into double probation because I’m in the medical profession and obviously they want to assure public safety, and a dui charge as a professional is bad news.. so the state monitors me from the POs office and from the medical professional board’s  side.. medical professional probation is way more intense than the criminal side, provided you don’t screw up; obviously jail is a worse place to be than the board adding a few more months to a monitoring agreement...( I haven’t been drinking... I’ve been completely sober for over a year now, not even a glass of wine with meals or a beer after a rough day)... maybe that would lift my depression? You’d think, since alcohol is a depressant, right? 

NOPE.. tried viibryd at a very low dose, half the minimum therapeutic dose, in fact... ended up suicidal and the depression went off the charts.. worst it’s been in years ( taking Wellbutrin with it per my shitty medical probation- appointed shrink ) in all fairness, I warned her SSRIs made me batty. Anyway- that lifts, a few months later, I quit the Wellbutrin- maybe I don’t need meds, I think. Well, that was actually a fairly painless med to stop. Maybe a few days angrier than I felt okay. I mean, I use more nicotine now and I’m not super focused... but all in all, not a bad withdrawal like I’ve gotten from SSRIs . No more depressed than before. It’s been months since I stopped- 

I still feel depressed but now my therapist wants me to work on some sexual abuse issues from my past, which I’m frankly afraid to get into since any sort of alcohol or drug use could compromise my freedom and I don’t really wanna go back to that.. I’m afraid digging into that will end me, since it turns out I’ve got some fairly recent issues with a sexual assault  that I somehow smoothed over in my mind as an accident on his part? Don’t ask me how my brain works.. ugh... anywho- I’m pro pot, but I can’t really do that as it’s not permitted and I am not willing to lose my freedom or license for any substance on this planet.  

I just want to feel better. I don’t. I keep telling myself when I’m off all of this probation, I’ll feel better- but I was massively depressed before I was on probation. It’s been an issue for 18 years. It’s caused me a lot of heartache and traditional treatments have never worked. I got the gene site testing done but my psychiatrist won’t share my results- so I’m getting them sent to me directly from the company. Don’t have them yet..but yikes! What on earth kind of life have I lived? I’ve lived like- 3 different lives in the last 18 years.. all crippled by depression. I’m 29 and I just want this to stop. I’m good at my job, hence I’ve managed to keep it despite my little blip with the law man. People also seem a bit more forgiving with alcohol related crimes since a lot of people have broken laws relating to alcohol, just not gotten caught.. so I am thankful for that... but damn! I wish I could just be normal! Anyone else with treatment resistant depression? What worked, what didn’t? Depression has ruined my life and I desperately want out... all I want is contentment!

I have had other crappy relationships in my life and some of them weren't so bad to get away from, others sunk me down into a deep hole. Through all of them, and several other personal crisises I have been alone.


It has made me lose trust for most people and has put me through a lot of pain.
Though when it comes to her, I fully trust her and have never had any doubts about her cheating or any of that.

Last weekend she planned a trip and didn't invite me, went there with a bunch of guys, I was naturally upset because she said I wasn't invited, and I have been so called friends with these people. We have had our rough patches, but I always believed we would get through them.

Now shes coming back and telling me that she had a connection with one of them and that she wants to be in an open relationship and sleep with him.
I know some people are into that, and that's fine, but I'm absolutely not okay with it. She's telling me she wants to leave because she won't be able to live her life the way she wants to- in an open relationship.

Now I know what that means has to be done...
But stupid me, I decided to try and talk her into staying with me, and that she could be satisfied with me again I told her I would try to stop being such a slob, and it's true, I have been kinda shit, I accept that, ever since I started my job in an assembly line (4years now) I've been more uptight and not so energetic, but I've done nothing but care about her and give her everything I had to give and made promises that this job would pay off one day and we could have that little house in the woods that we always wanted.

He suffocated himself with plastic (maybe the day before, no one knew). He was the kind that believed in reincarnation (he was Christian in name but not in faith ig? If that makes sense). This gave me the feeling that he was living some sort of fantasy of his? Because he watches shit and reads novels with like reincarnation and in most of those, the main character would reincarnate but redeem themselves in the second life. This was my theory but there were also thoughts that he was depressed etc. 

My friend was crying so I invited her over to my place (we weren't allowed to change seats but whatever). The news was shocker already to me but my friend cried and through the cries managed to whisper to me smtg like: He left, he left me....a watch. His watch.

Every recess, she would ask him for his watch before heading out for prefect duty. This was what he left her. His watch.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety back in high school (about 5 years ago). Recently, I decided to start tracking how often my anxiety and depression occurs so I could write it down and see if there were some lifestyle changes I could make. While doing that, I noticed my depression has a somewhat cyclical nature. It shows up in short bursts; usually lasting up to about a week or so, then disappearing for a couple weeks, and then returning again. In those weeks of not having depression I feel fine. I’m energetic, active, positive, and can function normally. But, in those short bursts of depression I feel remarkably low, fatigued, and almost like the world is completely crashing down on me. I feel completely numb and detached from everything, and these changes in mood don’t typically come with any kind of trigger. It just feels like they switch on and off.

649,depression,"So I was dating this girl for just under 2 years until we broke up in Feb last year. I ended it because I didn't feel good enough for her. Since then things have been bad. They were bad during the relationship and before it but because I'd developed a dependancy on her my mental health just took a dive for the worst. I was confused and insecure throughout the relationship. Whenever I tried breaking up with her she would jump on me and forcefully perform oral sex on me. And before that she'd ask me a multitude of questions. It became a pattern. The confusion came when we broke up for 3 months and the middle of it got into a fight and she told me ""why would i want your small useless penis"" I haven't been able to get over the abuse that took place and this combined with my low self esteem and self hatred has put me in a really bad place since the relationship ended. Not to mention the fact that up until last week she would call me or text me from time to time but I wouldn't respond. And when I wouldn't she'd start getting verbally abusive and make all kinds of threats. Speaking of threats she once told me that she would make me ""never want to go back to school again.( We were at the same uni) She was my first relationship and I've been tryna tell myself that if I pretend we were never together it  might help me get over it but it's not helping.

651,depression,"What is thinking? Something inside tells me something negative or I'm dumb. Ugly. Not dateable. Any future partner will be using me  I have to spend mental effort to oppose it and reason or tell myself that I'm not. It's like my brain just naturally inclines towards self loathing in a passive unstimulated state. It's the worst at night in bed or walking to places alone. 

I feel like I torment myself by trying to put myself down. If I step out of my view I know my life is in an okay spot. I have potential and things can get better. I just don't feel confident at all. A lot of self doubt. It feels somewhat existential too. 

I feel like I have to do so much to reach a point where I can consider myself an adult or human. I feel useless because there's so much I don't know. Life skills. Future job skills. I compare myself to people my age or younger and they got their life sorted. They look great. Great job. Etc. 

Yet rationally I know I shouldn't compare. I wasted my life earlier on games. I didn't sacrifice for that. I'm planning on learning things. Like the other part of me knows it's just a matter of learning things. Building confidence. 

But one part of me is trying to reach a robotic ideal where I am maximally useful or reliable. I can do everything or know how to help I'm every situation. I'm fully useful and reliable. This view is less about emotion and just being good. Optimal. Has experience in everything.

But in reality that's impossible. I'm too emotional of a person. I guess because I'm conflicted about that I self loathe. For being stupid. For not having much life exp. For not being able to help people as much as I can. I feel useless. Like I'll just become a walking cashgrab of a person (read: cuck (though I'm gay) tool or daddy) in future. 

It's like two sides of me are fighting. A depressive and negative influence against the side that sees a bright future ahead. Basically I know what to do and what mindset I should adopt. But I don't do it. Feels like an infectious mental curse that corrupts my thinking unless I actively internally rebuke it. This ends up taking a lot of mental energy sometimes. I dunno. 

I don't even know if it's depression. Maybe a sign or weak form. I know compared to others I haven't had anything terrible happen to me. Or maybe just being a passive observer is that terrible thing? I just feel like I have no reason to feel so bad. It's guilt in a way. Guilt that I'm doing well at least career wise but I'm still mentally still so weak. Like these feelings are invalid and should not be. I don't show anything or have anything to warrant it. 

Maybe I'm just afraid of pain. Both physical (for physical development and trying new physical challenges) and mental (for trying new social challenges and failing or being super awkward).

End of thoughts / vent. 

Tldr - bad inside voice telling me I'm stupid. Ugly. Won't ever be anything useful. Logical brain knows objectively I'm in a good spot. Just have to progress with life.

I don’t really know how to start this so here it is. 
Struggling with depression and suicide can be really hard. You might have known someone who has went through it or you might be going through it yourself. It hides it’s true face to everyone around you and can cause serious life and work related issues that you never knew were going to happen from that first day 3 years ago when you just said to yourself “I’m a little sad today”. Everyone told you that it was just a phase and that you would get better if you go outside or go out with friends. The truth is, you don’t even know why you’re here anymore. So doing any of those things is the last thing on your mind. I’ve been struggling with depression for 3 years and I’ve tried to kill myself twice. I’m not making this post to make anyone feel sorry for me or to come send their love and support. I’m making this post because I want people to understand that you can’t put a bandaid on emotions and expect it to just go away. This post is something that helps me and I know most of you don’t care, but I need to do something for myself. I’m drowning in my own mind and this is the only way to get out. My depression is suffocating and the unending itch to just end it all never goes away completely. It’s always there. That little voice in your head that tells you everyone hates you and no one would care about you if you were gone. Always nagging. I don’t need you to post saying “I would miss you” because if you understood you would know. A million I would miss you’s is nothing compared to an I love you from someone who understands you’re in pain and wants to be there just as an emotional support. Just to know that this person is there, no judging, no criticism. They just are there. That’s what someone going through depression needs and then it just takes time. It’s not an overnight process. I’ve been in therapy on and off for almost 6 months now and I’ve gone up and crashed back down hard. Just be there for that person. If you know someone who’s going through a hard time. Call them on the phone and tell them you love them. It honestly means the world to someone who is sad to hear they are loved.

658,depression,"Hello everyone,

I'm using a throwaway account as this is an uncomfortable and private subject for me to address.

I measure at just over 5 inches with not a great girth, and while this could be deemed average, depending on what research you look at, this has affected my general confidence and has left me lonely and generally unhappy in all facets of my life. It doesnt help that I'm 6ft2in, with a big frame... things dont exactly look proportional.

I'm 31 and have been single for the past 9 years with very few sexual encounters during that time. The reason being I dont feel good enough or adequate enough due to my size. I'm not a bad looking guy and my friends dont understand why I've struggled finding a relationship, but it's not exactly a topic I feel comfortable discussing with them. I can explain that I'm sad and lonely to them for support, but the underlying issue never gets bought up.

The trigger for this particular post is that I saw a joke memey thing on Facebook, that was directed at women, that said something along the lines of ""The more I'm single and the older  I get, my opening line for guys is ""Hi nice to meet you, how big is your dick?"", I havent got the time to be messing around"". Its got 30k likes and all these women saying ""Me!"" Or tagging their friends saying ""lol you""... and it defeats me. So what you're saying is I can't, and will never, be good enough. People like to say ""Penis size doesnt matter"", but those 30 thousand ladies didnt seem to think so, with no one saying otherwise. I'm not exactly experienced enough to ""motion of the ocean"" my way through.

I'm finding it hard to talk to women, chat someone up on a night out, because if it leads to anything I have to through the psychological torture of removing my clothes at some point. 

Its fucking me up, I'm so lonely and miserable and it all comes down to this feeling of inadequacy. I dont know how to deal with it. The misery creeps it's way into my normal life and theres no way of fixing it aside from fixing my brain, but I've spent half my life agonizing about it, so I dont see how my mindset changes.

I've taken a couple guitar lessons and also a few singing lessons along the way, but mostly I've just been slogging along by myself. I can play through some songs, once I learn them, but it still takes a while for me to really pick up a song. In the past I've dealt with social anxiety issues, so for me to be able to sing/play guitar in front of people has been a huge, lifelong challenge. One thing that I've been really proud of is that I performed at a few open mic nights. My boyfriend is also a musician who has been performing solo and in various bands for over 20 years. 

I feel like I should quit. I feel like music shouldn't be for me. I'm a 35 year old woman and I'm just now learning to play. And I'm not very good at it. In my heart I feel like I can sing.

I hate that I'm so old and not very good at anything. My boyfriend and I have tried to play together, like an acoustic duo type thing, with the intention of doing some open mics together, but every time we try to do it, I feel like shit and we never get anywhere. Last night, he took me to a rehearsal studio because he wanted me to have the experience of playing and singing with real professional equipment in an environment designed specifically for the purpose of making music. He thought it might help me feel better about myself and that it would just be fun. It was fun. We did practice a lot of stuff and I sang. But, after I just feel terrible. Like, so embarrassed that I even tried to sing like that. I'm sure it sounded horrible. My boyfriend says it sounded great and he even recorded me singing/playing a song because he wanted me to hear how good it sounds. But, I don't believe him. 

I love to sing and play guitar, but I get so depressed that it'll never amount to anything. I just feel like there's no point to it. I'll never be good enough to play with other people.

They didn't. They said it sounds like this illness and made an appointment with a psychiatrist so they could properly determine what I have.

I recently went through a horrible break up...a break up unlike any I had ever experienced before. Part of me feels lost, like it left with him. I don't think the same, feel the same, see my surroundings in the same way. Everything in my life just feels foreign and lonely. I have already been struggling with severe depression/anxiety nearly all my life (since I was 9) and I CANNOT, despite how much I will myself to try, see a healthy and happy way out of this depressive episode. I can't possibly manifest enough positivity to bring myself out of it this time....and I'm scared. Im legitimately worried about my well-being. My stability. My mental state. I cant do this, not this time. Its too much. And I don't have a support system anymore.

I would be regularly kicked out of the house for long periods of time at a young age and would have to sleep on my doorstep.(one time neighbor saw me and my mom accused me of looking for pity and trying to make her look bad). 

I’m 21 and never had a girlfriend. I’ve fucked one girl , my freshman year of college who broke my heart and made me realize how needy and insecure I was. I haven’t been with a girl in 3 yrs now and every attempt I now make ends in vain. All girls ghost me and it destroys my confidence. I’m a freak. I’m mentally destroyed now. All my friends have girlfriends or have game/can Pull and I hate going out w them and being the only one who has to be alone. 

I really want to kill myself. I’ve been depressed my whole life and suffered so many social embarrassments. I’m not bad looking so I’ve always gotten decent female attention but people I met would eventually realize how weird I was and it would become a talking point.

I don't really think this person knows what real depression feels like, nor is willing to listen to my advices.

hello, i'm throwing a SOS here as doctors in my country were not able to help me... has seen a bunch from several specialties (endocrinologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, immunologist etc) for 3/4 years without any amelioration, result or proper diagnostic.

i will try to make it as short as possible, let me know if other details are needed. 25 female, caucasian, europe, 1m60, 52 kg, currently no medication other than topical steroids for my eczema.sorry for the english.

I basically would like to know if what i am experiencing is ""normal"" and it's indeed something 'psychological', that i'm not the only case in this world, a confirmation that is depression/anxiety/stuff of this kind

p.S

Basically i've been through a quite rough period of my life a few years ago (a bit bullied, not comfortable at school etc), nothing that serious but i am a quite sensitive person. I developed some anxiety after it.

1. 3 years of my life, i stuggled to live and done everything with lots of effort. I basically forced myself and my body to keep up and be able to study etc. during those years my eczema was really awful (not sure if it was indeed atopic eczema or something else, but there was hives/itching and chronic flares up and scars).
2. 2 years of my life were in bed. going to the doctors to see if there's something wrong, blood tests positive, mri fine, sleep test fine. living with parents, being financially supported by them.

my main symptoms: you know the feeling you have when you have temperature (40 celsius degrees)? the feeling in the head? i had that (head feeling unwell). sometimes like someone had hit me on the head on different places. sometimes like there's something ""empty"" in my head or missing.feeling like someone had put a metal bar in my head. not migraines. feeling like i do not get enough oxygen. can describe more although it's difficult.

body weakness (not muscles weakness), as in no energy, feeling like i hadn't have sleep for ages (also i was sleeping more than i should), sleepy frequently, having long naps during the day.

superior members (arms etc) mainly feeling weak compared to the legs.

overall feeling very very unwell to the extent to not being able to do normal stuff (shower, etc). symptoms very physical NOT psychological (wasn't feeling sad or having dark thoughts). the head was the most awful thing. not migraines, not headaches. a bit hard to describe.

appetite quite normal.

really awful feelings, daily basis, even when just laying in bed i was feeling them and suffering.

I get really annoyed at myself for wasting the day and sleeping during the day and it brings me into a circle of having very low mood and feeling hopeless.

I am super anxious around them, like I just freeze and behave childish. I feel like an entertainer, listen to them. Always say something that makes them happy.

I drive her to college (the drive takes 35-45 mins home-college-home), About 1 hour later, I drive my brother to his institution. Then I try to sit and study, my sister calls, I pick her up and later my brother with some gap in between. I am totally exhausted. I am not talking physical. I can't stand eyes of so many people and the paranoia that I am jobless driver for my family. I have very low self esteem and get used most of the time. I talk to my family with low voice tone. I never went for diagnosis but I am sure it's scopophobia. It is hard getting past people and walk. If I sit somewhere and am thirsty, I won't stand up and fetch water as it grabs attention. In the earliest of my memories, I remember in 9th grade my teacher stood me up and asked me a question I couldn't understand. I felt awkward and wanted to sit down so badly. My eyes watered as teacher was looking at me.  
 It was religion and studies that kept me going. Highschool was so easy for me that it made me have more faith in God. I honestly believed that I was chosen one or something like that.

After nana died in 2010 she was very depressed and had to see psychologist. She recovered but she has anger issues. My older bro is a piece of shit. He always got respect by defaming me infront of my relatives. That's one big reason I have anxiety from my relatives. I don't talk to him anymore. My parents always liked him cause he can keep a conversation for an hour. I am shy. I realize now that I didn't say things even when they were right things to say.   
 Everybody thinks it's ""my duty"" to drive my brother/sister. Pick relatives up and drive them to their homes. Fetch this, that, bring things. Look after your 18 year old brother. I don't expect any appreciation, but I need little room of trust and privacy where I can do things for my own. I don't expect any affection or appreciation and also think I can't change them anymore.

Made my month! We had a gorgeous time out, a date night. So wonderful just to get out of the house and share some quality time together.

755,depression,"I’m really trying, but everyday is just another day I feel like i’m wasting. I’ll be 23 in a week, and since high school i’ve done nothing but fight with myself over what I want to do with my life, and the question of if its even worth the effort. I’m a disappointment to my father, and that is maybe the hardest thing for me. The shame that eats away at me constantly somedays is almost crippling. I’m not proud to admit but I did have a slight breakdown a few days ago which left me a sniveling sack of shit on my bedroom floor. I was just thinking about what to do that day and then I just fell off my bed and curled up on the ground. I felt pathetic, but i suppose its just because I am.

I had a job for four years, lost it three months ago because I just thought I was above the rules I guess. I was fed up with my job (which was a manager at pizza hut) and started drinking at work. Then I’d drive home shitfaced going over 100mph. I liked the thrill of it, but thinking it over I know there was a few nights I was half hoping I’d be a second to late on something and just fly off the highway. Ahhh the good days. I’ve been struggling to find a job since but I know my resume is just half a joke, and I don’t have a linkedin or anything like that. I’ve dumped all my social media since then besides reddit, but I never used it before all this. I’ve kinda started to like reddit (as impossible as that sounds) because in a sad way, I guess it makes me feel less alone about it all, which I know is horrible. I don’t gain any satisfaction reading peoples turmoils, I genuinely wish I could help... but as I remind myself all to often “How can you help anyone when you can’t even help yourself?”

But I do want to help myself, it has just been hard to figure myself out. Since I was rejected by the military (on the account I have a disease I didn’t even know about until they told me) I just shit down. I stopped caring about everything. I went i to a deep mental state of depression, but I didn’t call it that. I preferred to call it “being apathetic” same thing though. I retreated into video games to find solace, but as the years went by they all got so boring until recently i just uninstalled everything. I let my dreams die with my emotional state until I almost convinced myself I wasn’t even a real person, but just a shadow that could walk and move on its own. I tried so hard to detach from my problems, but we all know the harder you run, the harder it hounds you.

I want to get my life straight, and I don’t care what it takes. But I’m as unmotivated as I am determined. I can’t seem to give myself a break, but my life (filled with as much inner turmoil as it is) isn’t bad. I just don’t know what I want for myself.

My parents are homophobic, racist, hypocrites, and extremely closed minded. They don't understand that depression is a disease that anyone can have, even if they have everything anyone could ever want. They laugh at other people who have depression because they think depression is a joke. They think everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community is insane, mentally ill, and evil. They sneer at the homeless. Even when I try to show them how insensitive they are being, they don't listen to me. 

I, unfortunately, am everything they seem to hate. I'm depressed. I'm pansexual. And if I ever come out of the closet, I will be kicked out of the house and left to die on the streets. 

However, I've been staying quiet. They occasionally comment on how I'm still a failure, even though I try my hardest to impress them. Even though I try to smile more; even though I try not to have a crush with another cute person, regardless of whatever gender they are, I can't help it. Sooner or later, they're going to find out. I'm going to be kicked out to the streets and become another statistic. 

Even though I hate my parents... I still love them. They still care for me, even though they only care for the person I pretend to be. They give me food, water and a roof above my head... Yet even though they would hate the real me, I still can't hate them back. They've sacrificed their well-being for me... shouldn't I be able to sacrifice my happiness for theirs?

I would never wish them to be ill. I want them to live a long and happy life. In the end, they want me to live a perfect life that they never could have. 

I can't be the perfect daughter they wanted, and I feel awful because of that. I feel like a constant disappointment, and they remind me that I'm not good enough. I can no longer list a single positive trait about myself. I'm fat. I'm ugly. I'm stupid. I have no talent. I'm not special. I'm just a mistake. 

In the end, I'll have to tell them. They're going to be disappointed in me and themselves for raising me better into the perfect child they have always dreamed of. In the end, I'm most likely going to see the last of my days on the streets, just how the statistics forecast. 

But as for today, I will stay quiet. Tomorrow, I will wish I was different. The day after that, I will hate myself for thinking that I'm suffering more than anyone else. The cycle will continue until the tire runs flat. But by then, no one will care or remember me. By then... it will all be over.

When a darkness falls,
When all seems lost,
When the fear of the unknown calls,
What will be the final cost ?

When, a ray of hope,
you finally see.
You grasp at it,
but it is not to be.

When, you had it all,
At the start,
Why and how you ask,
did it all fall apart?

When your life
appears to be in trouble,
All problems, big and small,
seem to double.

When finally you think
it can’t get worse,
It feels as if life itself;
is the curse.

When given a pill,
it’s hard to swallow,
For it’s in self doubt, pity &amp; guilt,
That your mind does wallow.

When you think about
what might have been,
Where happiness once was,
Now only emptiness can be seen.

When emotions run wild,
deep in your heart,
Despair begins,
Dark and Dangerous thoughts start.

When drugs and or loneliness,
become your only friend,
Your silent wish is
for it all to end.

When all you seek
an end to your pain,
You don’t care;
if a child’s horrific loss, is your gain.

When at its deepest and darkest,
it all becomes too much,
It’s too late you feel,
for that loving human touch.

When you are in that hole
and you want it to end,
all you need to do is

I was doing better for months until I had a series of unfortunate things I mostly caused happen all at once.

I moved out at my parents house, i miss having someone close to talk to and who are actually happy to see me.  I only know one of my roommates well enough to somewhat talk to about deep stuff bothering me, and even him it goes in one ear, out the other.

My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me, but I need to get back to that.

My drug habit has gotten to the point I’ve lost my sense of who I am.  For a month now, I haven’t spent a day sober, I’ve tried, but by the end of the night I somehow have gotten hold of either cocaine or percocets.  I don’t even remember how I get them, theyre just there in front of me crushed up, about to go into my nose.  My roommates think I’m a degenerate, and I don’t blame them, thats all they’ve seen my do since I moved it.  

Now back to this ex.  I dated her for 3 years, she was the girl I had always dreamed of.  Loved indie music, an artist, short, goofy, but deep thoughts, amazing sex and open to what I liked.  I did everything for her, I stuck with her even after only seeing her 3 times in 3 months due to an eating disorder.  I gave her a place to stay after her dad disappeared for 3 days threatening suicide, I bought her and her brother food whenever.  

But then things changed within a few months, she told me it was just stress and I gave her the benefit of the doubt even though she wouldn’t even try to be intimate with me like she used to.  But the day I moved out, she decided to tell me she had lost sexual attraction for me, and left.  I tried telling her its a common thing in long relationships (right?) and we can work on it.  She wouldn’t budge.  Yesterday her friend sent me proof she had been talking to this guy and sending him nudes pretty much a few days after we broke up.  I knew the dude, I called her out for having a snapchat streak with him before since she would of gotten mad if I had one with a girl and she told me it was just a friend she met in class.  I had my doubts but I trusted her. 

But now she sends him everything I had ever wanted and had to work for forever.  It doesn’t bother me she moved on, I get it, it happens.  Its that I believed her was someone uglier than me, and now my self confidence has taken a huge drop.  

On top of all this I realized I hate every moment of my job, but it is the only way I can afford rent. 

TL:DR- I’m hanging on by a thread.  I’ve dug myself into such a deep hole and won’t take advice from anybody.  I hate my job and standing alone in there for 5 hours drives me insane,  I’ve lost all interest in any hobbies, I haven’t been sober for a month since I’ve moved out, my ex had been flirting with a guy after 3 years of me putting everything in.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am 1 of 3 children I have never stood out my mom likes my sister best and my father likes my brother best (although they would never say it, its fairly obvious), and then that leaves me just the odd one out. I'm treated just fine which is why I hate that i feel so shitty, like why can't I just be happy with what I have. I think the real issue I have here is that my life has no positive effects on them i'm sure they would be ""sad"" if i died, but honestly I can't think of one single bad thing that would happen, but the lists of benefits goes on and on. It's weird that suicide was ever on my my mind in the first place, but its just a normal thought at this point, and i'm ashamed to say I think about it almost daily.

A few years ago I lost my grandparents (its kinda complicated but they aren't dead however they might as well be), when I did I never cried about it, not once. I was very close with my grandma, to the point that I basically lived at her house and now I haven't seen her in almost 4 years, i didn't even have the chance to say goodbye, and yet I never cried and I find it hard to even feel sad about it. This is the main reason I think there is something seriously wrong with me, because I remember being a kid and when kids said their grandparents died I got scared just thinking what if my grandma did, and yet now that she is it really hasn't effected me at all. 

Last year my dog died, and this is the dog I had since I was in kindergarten, I would sleep with her every night, and the same thing happened when she died I didn't feel sad, and I didn't cry. I remember seeing every other member of my family cry or act sad in some way, but not me I just kept going same as always.

Everything from my speech to my movements are weird, its almost as if i'm a different species and I know others can see it too. Sometimes I feel like everyone knows to avoid me before they ever see me. The worst part is I wasn't always like this, I can remember early elementary school being a normal happy kid.

I'm in college and yet I have never had a girlfriend, and I feel that hurts most of all, I try to forget about it, but no matter how hard I try I cant. I guess you could call me a hopeless romantic, but I feel like thats a generous term I feel more like a creep cause anytime I get any sort of attention from a girl I ""fall in love"", this has lead to me being a sad and desperate person. I see kids half my damn age talking about their ex girlfriend and I cant take it I feel like such a loser. I also hate it when people say ""why are you so worried you will find someone eventually"", its like no you don't understand some people just don't. I don't know why I want a girlfriend so bad, but when it gets really bad I tell myself there is a person out there waiting for me and if I die then she will be left alone so I have to live for her sake (i know its dumb, but you know it is what it is). 

When I started college I was happy i thought I can finally get away from the person I once was, these people don't know who I am, and I can be better, not act like such a weirdo. For the first semester or so i felt good but now its all coming back and its hitting harder than ever, I just hate, like why the fuck cant I blend in I don't get it  I feel like i'm marked and I will forever be this way no matter what I do or where I go. 

In college the parties were fun but at one I got really drunk and I woke up with a huge scar on my arm. I just wore a hoodie for about a month (there is still a faded mark but its basically gone now) no one noticed I assume its because they just didn't care enough to notice, and why would they care about someone who doesn't even care about himself.

I recently got really into weed it was nice it kind of made me forget everything, and i know that people say don't use drugs to cope, but honestly its better than the alternative. 

I find my very existence is contradictory I wanna be unique but I wanna fit in, I want people to stop pitying me but I keep giving them reasons to. Its like there is a war to decide every decision I make and every time I feel like I made the wrong one. I don't want people to know how shitty I feel, but I always allude to it, weather it is in my musical choice or the expressions I make, or the fact that I flat out tell them i'm depressed when i'm drunk, but they never do anything, I assume they just don't care but honestly what do I want them to do?

I have this wish that one day I can go back in time and do it all again, or maybe that this was all a dream and I don't actually have to be me. I don't know what is the point of hoping for that though its like hoping ever did anything, if it did I wouldn't be like this because I pray and wish everyday somehow that I can be better, but it never happens because I don't really put in the effort I say I am unable to and I know that is just a lie I can I just chose not to and I hate that, why am I just sitting here typing a damn essay about how depressed I am instead of doing something about it, maybe its because everything I try just fails.

I have been depressed for years now, and I always told myself I was just making it up, so I never told anyone. Now I feel so alone I lie on a daily basis (for a variety of reasons), which is why now I feel like no body knows or understands me, but how could I expect them to. 

I know I am my own worst enemy and I cause all these problems, there have been periods where I don't even leave my room, not even because I don't want to because I have no where to go, I used to put in the effort I would just walk in a circles just to not feel like I was locked in a prison in my own room but it really just made it worse I always felt like people saw that I had no where to go and were judging me.

All in all I really only feel shitty when it comes to myself I'm starting to realize I don't care about others and I know its fucked up but I cant control it. I ask myself sometimes why I don't just kill myself, and if i'm gonna be honest, I don't know a lot of times I just find dumb little excuses not to (like I mentioned before), none of them are actually good enough for me to live for, so why do I keep living I really don't know. I think if i died tomorrow would I wish I was alive and the truth is i couldn't say I feel no real attachment to this world, but if that was true I probably would have killed myself by now.

785,depression,"I think that when I was really young, about seven to ten years old, I was sexually assaulted by someone who used to be a friend of mine.  I am going to call her Olivia (not her real name).  We have not talked in years.

So, like Olivia, I am female and we are also the same age.  I did not know anything about the LGBTQ+ community.   
However, I now recognize myself as bisexual and I have had relationships with both guys and girls.  My parents don't support the LGBTQ+ community, however, especially my mom, who says a lot of negative things about the community.  She does not like gay people and she calls trans people things like ""its"", etc.  I feel like my family would not support me if I were to tell them that I am bisexual.

Looking back, I think that Olivia may have liked me or something.  I don't know how I felt about her though, she was a friend to me.

Anyway, Olivia took all of her clothes off and she made me get undressed too.  I was at her house the first time that she got on top of me and started to kiss me and all that, I didn't know what was going on and I don't remember what I did.   
We were not girlfriends or anything though and this continued.  A few years later, I was ten and Olivia went into my room and started to take her top off and stuff.  I was not comfortable with that.  She told me to take my top off, and I said no, but she said that since she did so, I do too.  So I did.  Olivia wanted me to kiss her but I said no and made an excuse not to but we kissed anyway.  Olivia started to talk at school during lunch about this stuff when other people were around, which was really awkward and made me even more uncomfortable because it was not funny and it was really personal.

We were never together or anything.  I do sometimes just randomly think about it.  Doesn't matter where I am.  It has definitely effected the way that I think about sex though.  I'm not asexual or anything, I do get turned on and I do want to have sex.  But after a short period of time of watching pornography, I stop and regret it.  Like, as if it is wrong or something.  I've never really told anyone about this except my boyfriend and my ex.  I am scared to seek proper help about the it though because it happened so long ago, even though it does still effect me. 

I know that this probably is not serious as I think it is, and I'm just a dumb teenager overreacting or something, which is why I want other peoples' opinion on my experience.  I feel that my experience is probably insignificant compared to others, because other peoples' stories involve things that are worse than just unwanted nudity and kissing, like rape and stuff.  Other people have had worse problems than me. 

I've had other experiences with girls my age that made me uncomfortable like this too.  Not too long ago, I went to Disney for a band field trip and this one girl was making me really uncomfortable.  She knew that I am bisexual and that I have a boyfriend, but she would not stop telling me to break up with my boyfriend and to be with her instead.  I said no and told her to stop.  She kept asking me, and I said no.  I told my ex (who is also in band and is still a really good friend of mine) about her.  

I didn't tell my boyfriend about her though.  To be honest, I do feel closer with my ex than my boyfriend.  My ex knows that I have a boyfriend, but we still talk about certain things.  I might still have feelings for my ex.  I was the one who broke up with him and I don't even know why.  I really, really miss him, but I also really, really doubt that he still has feelings for me.  My boyfriend never talks to me and he always says that he is busy.  

A couple years ago, I cut myself and my mom noticed and she just thought that I was doing it because other people were doing it or something.  She doesn't know anything.  I didn't have it in me to talk to her about it though, I didn't want to make things worse or to make her sad.

786,depression,"I always get this feeling that I call the kernel. Its the best way I can think of to describe it. When Im feeling okay and having a good time, sometimes I can feel the kernel being planted in the very back of my head. I still feel okay, but I have this overwhelming sense of dread, anxiety, panic, sadness, nausea, everything. Its like I feel okay but I know that a wave of dread is about to completely crash over me and it makes me freak out. Its one of those feelings where you want to lie down and cry but even if you did the tears wouldnt come out. It happens at completely random times and it gives me major anxiety because I am just waiting for it all to hit me. Sometimes it does, and other times it goes away after some time and I wonder why I was even feeling that way to begin with. I think it often has to do with my substance abuse and being an overly nostalgic person. The kernel in the very back of my head is telling me to move backwards rather than forwards. To indulge in my past experiences like my old video games, tv shows, daily activities. It keeps me stuck in a recurring cycle of doing the same thing over and over. Its like being happy and reminiscing makes me sad rather than happy and when I am happy the kernel reminds me that I am actually depressed, and my mood changes in an instant. Ive read a lot about how the human mind filters out bad things in the past to remember all the good, but I honestly dont think I had bad things happen to me when I was younger. I was just overall a happier person without the realization that there was nothing ahead of me. I actually do have aspirations and dreams of the future but it feels like they are unobtainable and I would rather cry and even die than actually pursue anything important. At this point I am just tipsy and rambling but I just wanted to know if anybody else feels the experience of this “kernel”. 

TL/DR: There is a kernel in the very back of the head that reminds you that you are about to be hit by fear, sadness, and anxiety but there is no way to tell when its going to hit. Its like you want to rip it out of your brain.

My bird “buddy” died in front of me and I remember laying on my bed with him for hours, staring at his lifeless corpse, learning what death is for the first time. This darkness enveloped me and began eating away at me day in and day out, thinking how pointless it all is if that is all it leads to. 

Years passed and I tried to adopt the mentality of “live for today” to dig myself out of that dark pit and all it lead to was a series of bad decisions which cemented my place in hell to this day. I’ve fallen in love, and been discarded as toxic three times for being my true self. I’ve had flings with a lot of women, which didn’t make me feel better at All Because I have no ego and generally that’s what one does to appease it. 

I’ve tried what I considered to be a fulfilling career as a tattoo artist, gained popularity and made my money that way for 8 years. but my art was dark and twisted and people who grew close to me eventually realized how toxic I am. I always held my friends to such high moral or fabricated ethical standards to the point that it understandably made them leave. 

I stayed isolated after about age 24. I lost all ambition to pursue relationships of any kind, lost ambition in art, career, fun, everything really because I feel unworthy. I feel like a chemical reject. Like something is deeply wrong with me and no matter what I do to hide this darkness, it sticks to my insides like cancer. 

My 32nd birthday just passed and I realized it’s been 8 years since I’ve felt close to anyone or have even been touched by someone. I live in my room in filth, barely able to muster the energy to watch tv. I only leave the house to get money for survival, I’ve gained almost 100 lbs, I’ve lost all my teeth in the front and my life has passed me by.

When my mom dies I won’t even be able to afford a funeral, it will be just a box in the ground and I’ll probably be the only one who cares because my brother and sister could care less if she died.

I took a break and focused on work and managing my mental health, finally getting to a place where I thought I would now be capable to try again.

817,depression,"Hi. It’s the first time i see this subreddit and it gave me courage to write this. Excuse me for my written english, it’s not my native language.

On the past couple of years I have experienced a full downgrade on my life expectancy. I had a really cool job at a glass producing plant in Barranquilla, Colombia but they had a personnel cut and i was fired bc of that.

I’m an electronic engineer. My GPA was 4.1. Always good grades at school and at college. Parents proud. No bullying suffered. Everything came good. 

The day they fired me i was dirty, they called me after i fixed a glass tempering furnace. There were rumors on the company that maybe engineers would be cut off (i don’t know any synonyms of fired). I was the youngest of my crew only had 23 at that time. It really crashed me. I thought it was because of my experience. I had never received an attention call from my boss or anybody. Always did what i had to do. 

I guess that moment is important. Since then, august 2017: I have never work in the career i chose and i love.

I went to Panama two weeks after that in order to help an aunt with being a parking cashier, and to explore opportunities here, i didn’t mind doing it, my father went here too and got a well paid job, he didn’t got any in colombia, things still are tough. So it was the two of us. 

I wanted to work on my career and the only thing I needed was a work permit. After a year and a half, and a lot of money spent i couldn’t have the work permit and i was obliged to quit my job as cashier and to go back to my country. I was devastated. I couldn’t do anything. Time and money wasted all over. This all happened last december. 

Came back to colombia on february in order to get a job of my career. Things are tough. Companies want to hire a 25-30 year old worker with 10y experience. On minimum wages. My dad told me there was a chance to study another thing here in panama. Marketing and Advertising. I started in may. Im getting good grades, everything’s good. He tells me i need a job here, he can’t pay this. I don’t have work permit. I don’t have anything else that my passport. I’m ‘illegal’. I can study and graduate but i have to leave the country every three months in order to renew my status. 

I don’t blame my father, he paid me a career. I just don’t know what to do. I know work dignifies man. I just don’t want to spend my life being the adult i didn’t want to be as a kid. A loser. I can’t find any job now. I don’t know if i chose well. I can’t find any job here. I was trying to teach kids here to make some cash but no luck at that.

818,depression,"So first for context, Im a 400lb or 181KG (for the rest of the world) male, 5""8 or 176cm, 20 YO

I dont really know how to express my feelings but this is my best try. The beginning will be ALOT of context

 For my whole life I have managed to convince myself that everything would be okay eventually. My weight has been a problem for a long time, it severely impacted my self esteem but I considered myself intellectually skilled so I used that to remain afloat. I think have a supportive family when I share my concerns or emotions but it just doesn't come easily to me. My mother means the world to me and some, and i love my sister almost as equally. My mother is very sick, when its not one condition making her ill its another. I am a roman catholic, and am now in the summer before my last year of University. 

I am constantly having episodes of ""emotions"" (its what i call it) but i can usually am able to move past it with some sleep and convincing myself everything is going to be alright. Recently everything is failing to help alleviate my suffering. Due to the exposure of the catholic church's crimes I am distant from the church, which used to be one of the things I looked towards when feeling down. I make a point to try and not dream  (about trivial things such as vacations or stuff like that ) due to the fear of disappointment, i had learned from experience that it hurts more to have hoped so I prefer not to. 

I have thought of self harm before, and my sister studies medicine so im familiar with how to go through with it if i wanted to. However, the thought of the damage I would cause in my household (my mom would die of a heart attack and everyone would die inside from having lost my mom) and my religious beliefs have kept me away from any attempts. 

Academically, I have underpreformed in college due to procrastination, which I contribute to laziness or simply the fear of actually trying and failing as that would destroy the little self esteem I have left (i dont know but i read about the second one and it could be true) . I have somehow made it to this point and had a fairly decent semester. I was within the 385ish range of weight for the last about 6 months and paid for a overpriced but good gym subscription (since i felt money motivates me)  and for a few months it was going okay, lost a bit of weight but when the semester began it became complicated. I dont have a license to drive yet and my sister works so our schedules became difficult. As a result, our time in the gym has diminished to basically nothing. 

The reason why this is important is because I feel myself slowly losing sight of all things good in my life. 

Recently, I reach the big 400 pounds. I can still walk and take care of myself at least. But when I read the scale I became unable to ignore the elephant in the room. The real reason I avoid any social interaction with people, and prefer to spend all day at home. The same reason i dont attend classrooms if they are in a lecture hall, and the same reason I haven't tried to get (and keep) a job. I feel my life is limited by my weight. 

I cant sit in the same position for a prolonged period of time before my limbs begin to go numb , im always out of breath, i cant sleep in one position for long because it begins to ache, I am afraid to go out because im not sure if where i go will be fat friendly or if the chair will feel as if its crumbling under me. I really want my drivers license but im afraid of trying because last time i practiced my limbs were going numb from sitting and my arms dont reach the steering wheel in any comfortable position. I recently turned down a vacation opportunity because the last time i was on a plane i was uncomfortable and crossing over into my neighbors chair space. 

Usually this would be just fine but I have come to the realization that I want to live my life but cant. Im tired of acting like i just dont want to go to the movies, im tired of acting like i dont die inside every time I enter a store and cant find anything my size, im tired of convincing myself i dont want to date so that i can ease the pain of being as attractive as jobba the hutt. Im just so tired of being in my body. I was always able to keep hope that one day with hard work I would get to an okay weight, but its been 15+ years of hoping and im out of hope. I feel guilty for being so tired of life when my family tries so hard to fill me with love, but its just not enough. Everything is going numb again, stuff isnt as funny as it used to be and honestly life feels like its just passing me by. Im increasingly upset and bothered by my own existence. Everything sucks and I dont want to continue living like this (i have no intention of committing suicide ever so that is not a concern) I want to be happy and laugh, I want to breathe and run and jump. I want to feel warmth when my mother hugs me, but recently everything is so bland. I read books about people who have been depressed and described everything as gray and until now i never knew how true that could be. I am not diagnosed so I do not believe I have depression but my emotional state is just making me miserable. I have tried everything to lose weight but have had no luck, even if i did try i just cant motivate myself to do anything anymore. 

 My parents have noticed my change in mood and I believe my mother is beginning to fear something is wrong with me as she was overly affectionate and reassuring today.

Hello people of r/depression, I wanted to talk a bit with you tonight as I can't sleep, I am a very anxious person and if there was a way to remove any physiological need, that would be ~~anxiety~~ sleep. 

It came in my mind that I wanted to learn more about depression, but instead of doing a boring lonely research on Internet, I would really like to hear your personal point of view on depression and how it is actually impacting your life. 

I have a lot of question I would like to ask you but I will pose them after I tell you a little story that happened to me a year ago...

For the first time in my life, I seriously thought I was depressed and it all came up because I slowly realized how bad my life was and how bad I wanted to modify it. For a month or so, everyday was like the others. I am not talking about the daily routine, but the thinking process that permeated them. 

I would get up, get at the mirror, watch my tired face and realize, that would have been another day closed in myself (even if I live with other three roomates), because of my fear of confrontation. I lived those days thinking constantly how bad I was in social contexts, and all I wanted was to isolate myself, and cuddle myself in tears of hope. It was the cry of a man that wished had tried love other than the natural kind your parents are always willing to give. I was dying inside to have somebody honest to talk to, somebody I could trust but I knew I could not find it soon or later, because the problem of my social anxiety was only me and myself, nothing else. Those were days of extreme isolation, playing even alone on my PC, not even willing to speak to my usual online friends. 

I would cry almost two times at day, mostly because I wanted a partner in study or simply a partner in life. 

I seriously thought about suicide for one time and how I would do it, but being the instinctively optimist person I am, I quickly erased those thoughts and replaced them with hopeful sadness. 



Now, I know some people suffer of real depression, meaning there is a kind that you can get after following certain habits for a long time, but there is also a kind that comes naturally installed in your brain when you grow up. 

I wanted to ask YOU, the person who is reading, some personal questions and opinions about your actual living state and how life has changed after you got daily depression striking your mind. 

Here is a list of questions I have for you:

1) How old are you?
 
2) What triggered your depression? 

3) What do you miss most of not being depressed? 

4) What do you think could help you in completely remove depression? (it can be anything, I want you to be completely honest here. A better society? Somebody that really understands you? Expecting something from people? Expecting something from yourself? Wish you had or did not have something in your body, or mental ability?) 

5) How is your day? Can you see a routine in your life? 

6) What are some things you instead like of depression? For example the calmness after a whole day crying in bed, or taking a med. 

7) Could your depression be cured if the kind of person you always wanted to meet randomly joins your life? (The teacher/son/partner/SO/lover/friend you always wanted in your life. Even, dunno, a person that every morning would show up at your door and shout ""Ehy bro come on let's do some bullshit together this morning"") 

I don't want to sound childish with these questions but I always thought depression is a state of the mind where it locks itself in a boring and never exciting experimentation of life, even new things don't excite you anymore, not because you don't like them but because probably nobody is willing to listen you speaking about them, if not your therapist. 

I hope this post doesn't get deleted. 

And I really hope I get some answers to read. 

And I repeat, as an anxious person I have a huge respect in people that struggle with major disorders and still find the strength every morning, to get out of bed and hoping to find joy someday.

843,depression,"Just venting. 

I'm 32, going on 33, and I've missed every major milestone in my life - no first kiss, no prom, no best friend moments, no first roommates, no college experiences (I commuted to college from home). Mostly it was because of my weight and the social anxiety that came from that, but even when I dropped lots and lots of weight when I was 26 for work (went down 100 lbs to where I was actually happy enough to take photos of myself for the first time in my life) it didn't do anything. 

Fast forward to now and I'm back up to my old fat self and working at a boring job as an adult. I signed up for a gym a few weeks ago and I've been going steadily and I've decided to get back down to the weight where I was happy again, but does it matter? I've missed every milestone in my life and nothing changed like I thought it would. I didn't magically get friends or learn how to be a socially-functioning adult. And I didn't want to - I wanted to be a teenager again, but I couldn't do it. 

The very few people I've ever oppened up to about this have said stupid, insipid shit like ""milestones aren't real"" or ""everyone lives life differently"", but that's complete bullshit from people who have had their moments. I can't get those moments back at my age and I've missed core personal development in high school and college that I can't just re-grow. 

I don't know what to do. I want to stop hating everyone around me becuase it's destroying what few casual friendships I have and sometimes it leaks out as pure venom that always throws people off (I do customer/technical service, so I just use my 'service personality' all the time). It's getting harder and harder to bottle it all up. And on the rare occassions I can look past the jealousy and hatred and just hang out with people, they always say I'm immature for my age because I'm just stuck personality-wise.

I always think to myself maybe it’s me? Maybe I’m just really annoying, idk. And I’ll constantly go from being happy for awhile to back to this pain and suffering in my head to where looking at one of my guns makes it all so tempting. Last year I went through a nasty break to top it all up and I feel like it was all my fault in why things becoming such a mess.

853,depression,"I don't even know how to start this thing because in my head its a garbled mess but I am just at a loss of what to do in my life as of now. I don't have the mental energy for anything anymore. I can't seem to find anything as engaging as I used to no matter what it is. I am all but apathetic about almost everything in life. I recently moved back into my parents house to try and get better after breaking up with my fiance. The idea behind it was to have the time to focus on working out and seeing a therapist. It seems like I blinked and all of the sudden I have a job that is basically full time, haven't worked out once and am nowhere near better. I didn't want a job when I moved here, the point was not to have one. When I asked my parents to move back they said it was fine and I didn't have to worry about anything yet once I got here they wanted me to make money and work so now I work 4-5 days a week even though that was specifically what I moved here to do.

Just the thought of trying to eat healthy and seeing if I can work out again sounds overwhelming. Now I don't know how I could possibly do that with a job and normal day to day stuff that is hard for me too (like hygiene and shit). Most days it feels like I am just waiting until the time comes when I have to do something else, like go to work, and then once I get to that next thing, I just wait until the time goes by on that so I can go back home or whatever is next. My whole life seems like its killing time until the next event that kills time until the next one and so on and so on. I don't ever feel like I have the mental energy to do anything let alone the motivation to get my shit together and get better.

Part of me just wants to start over again and move back to the city that I actually enjoy since this hasn't seemed to be working but neither did living there so...I guess I just feel trapped and lost and don't even know what to do. I am seeing a therapist but he had a family emergency and I haven't been able to see anyone for a few weeks now and even then, I don't know what good it is going to do.

I feel like I sound like a whiny teenager at this point and I don't know if I am making any sense in the first place, so sorry for the steam of conscious post as I sit here at work trying to see a way out of this.

I haven’t felt happy in years. I made probably what was my point 10th attempt at a relationship a week ago today. My best friend and I had gotten pretty close, and I started to want more than that. She seemed pretty into me, and told me she just ended her current relationship about a week prior. I ended up asking her out and she says she thinks she feels the same way, and to give her sometime to think about it. 

Over the next week she quickly gets closer to me. She tells me she’s closer to me than anyone else, that I’m her favourite person, that I treat her better than any other guy. We get a lot more comfortable around each other, to the point where she’s pretty much stuck to me like glue, always basically stood onto of me and hugging me all the time. 2 days ago I asked her if she had made up her mind, but she said she was still unsure. 

Yesterday she was a lot quieter than usual, and clearly didn’t want to talk to me as much. I gave her a bit of space and went on to go do some other stuff. Late that night she messaged me telling me she had to tell me something. It turns out she was still dating the other guy, and they were just going through a rough patch but now they are back together.

I feel like shit. It was the happiest I’ve been in years and it was her that made me happy. She was the one I would always go to when I felt depressed or anxious and now I can’t talk to her without wanting to die. I wish I could take it back and just go back to being friends, but I don’t think I can. I also don’t want to leave her completely because she’s was my best friend and also struggles with depression. I don’t know what to do, but right now I’m just trying to bottle everything up. I’ve officially given up on relationships, given up on happiness and slowly getting closer to killing my self.

862,depression,"With depression, I have always had this little voice in my head that would have nothing nice to say. It was the same voice that told me I was fat and ugly and lead me to an eating disorder where I lost 30 pounds in 3 months and still felt fat. It was the same voice that told me I was not good enough to be loved, to be happy, that I was not smart enough and that being alive was pointless. It was the same voice that pushed me to suicide.

After all this, I took a lot of time to reflect and did a lot of self CBT. During this, a new voice came round and it was magnificant. It was kind to me. It helped me lose weight in a positive, slow, and healthy way with encouraging words like ""You are beautiful."" ""Great job today!"" ""Don't feel bad for having a cheat day/rest day, we all need breaks!"" As a result, I gained a magnificant new body and felt confident and pretty for the first time. I enjoyed going out. I could socialize and was more enjoyable with my family and friends. The voice became my best friend and anytime I was sad or had a bad encounter, it was always there to reassure me that **it was ok**.

Lately I have been so overwhelmed with life that I had no time to listen to it anymore, and slowly the dark thoughts began to arise. I gained weight and because I have been struggling with securing a job and progressing, my outlook began to look bleak again and the voice kept edging me to ""give up"" and ""end it all"". The thoughts were scary and so familar and I could feel myself sinking into it once more. Until today.

Today I found my strength to find the positive voice again. Today I told myself instead of how ""much weight I gained"" that I should be proud that despite the weight I gained, that I still made an effort to exercise and eat right everyday. Despite my current unemployment struggles and how much of a bum I am, I told myself how strong I was that I never stopped for a day to email/call/and apply to every job I could. Despite how ugly I felt in my photos, the positive thoughts came through and pointed out how how they are all pictures of me outside, walking, and not locked up. The thoughts reminded me I wasn't as ugly as I felt and I should take the time to cleanse my skin and brush my hair before sleeping. 

I know this might sound weird, but there is a happy voice in all of us. Don't lose it.

I was able to explain to her how much medication was able to change my perspective and that it might have great effects on herself as well.

The hardest part now, is convincing her that medication and therapy are two equally important halves to the treatment, and that their positive effects with each other are multiplicative, not additive.

In choosing courses for college, in choosing a profession. I've tried everything from college computing, worked 2 years with e-sports, tried government jobs through tests, now I'm in the financial market. Never, no one, absolutely no person in this world, never supported me, believed me.
And when I finally thought I'd found someone who might be a special person, she'd start to treat me like crap overnight.

I tried to ignore it, I thought it might just be a few days and then she would see that she had been a bit of an idiot.
So today, I had a panic attack on the street, I was very disoriented and luckily I made a call to my sister who came to pick me up and take me away (besides that too, besides saying that it was because she got pity of my parents if I died and did not want it in her conscience).

I went and told the person that I thought would be special.
I told him I had been ill on the street and that my sister had rescued me.

Then she turned to me and said: You are a stupid! Why did you go out on the wrong street? I'm not going to put my hand on your head, no!

And I kept trying to tell her that I did not leave because I was feeling bad, I left because I had to solve things on the street and I had a bad time on the way, and yet she continued to offend me, minimizing me.

I’m a 22 year old male college student. The past few months have been really rough for me. I have struggled with anxiety for years but only lately has things really started to get a lot worse. Now even when I go out to a bar with my friends i seem to have a panic attack randomly, where i feel like I can’t breath and get light headed.  I have to go sit by myself for like 10-15 minutes to calm down and resume. I only get these while at the bars but I’ve been doing this and having fun for a couple years now so I don’t understand it. 

I’ve been especially depressed lately so that may have something to do with it. I’m going into my last year at university of Georgia with my major being electrical engineering and I’ve maintained a 3.2 gpa. I’ve been told that I’m doing really well but it’s like I don’t care anymore. I just force myself to keep going. I don’t have a passion for anything that I know of and even though I don’t hate my major I just feel so lost. 

I’ve never been in a relationship or romantically close to anyone and thus sometimes I get really lonely. This has always been tough as my anxiety gets in the way along with my terrible self esteem. Part of me has already given up finding anyone to be close with.

The only thing keeping me going is my family and friends. I’d rather rot in a dungeon for the next 50 years than have them go through something bad happening to me. I wish I felt like that about myself but I dread having to live the rest of my life especially if it means working all day and living alone with no passion or purpose.

I have been lonely since after middleschool when we moved to a new town. I had great friends in middleschool and was very social. When we moved to a new town in my freshman year, everything went down hill. In my freshman year i got a terrible nickname and couldn't make any friends because of it and i started spending weekends alone and im in senior year now and nothing has gotten better. My nickname has disappeared though because everyone has forgotten about me and i became the quiet kid in school. My social skills has gone down and i cant even make friends outside my school or keep my old friends and now my mom is constantly telling me how disappointed she is because i cant find a date for prom and she also keeps telling me to get friends to hang out with during holidays as all i have to do with myself during these times is to play video games.

She looked like queen margaery from GoT as i fell in love with her while re watching the show and couldn't stop thinking of her(ik its wierd). So while i sat playing games and imaging myself with such a girl i snapped back to reality and realized how little i actually have and how i may probably miss out on this experience of loving someone so much you'll do anything for them and spending time with that person and going places with her and laughing about stupid things.

I am scared that i will never experience this beautiful side of life and never meet someone like this. I also dont experience any love from my family.

I have tried to quit drinking, r/stopdrinking has been unbelievably helpful. It has been moderately successful. I stopped drinking during the week altogether, despite the cravings. 

However I failed today. It’s Monday at 6:30pm. I just left the bar after work. Today was one of the most stressful days in recent months and I needed an exit and so my commitment to not drinking broke. I am so fucking sad.

I started with the drinking because it exacerbated the others. It makes sense to me to start there. But here I am. On a Monday at 6:30pm writing this while half drunk.

I had seen the signs of this coming on but I drowned them all out with hobbies and alcohol. And so now we’re here.

So I’m a 24 year old guy living in the northeast. Ever sense I was a kid I’ve had a very muted outward demeanor. Meaning, I don’t talk much, don’t have a lot of expression and don’t party a lot. I was always kind of okay with it, because I knew that I had a lot of other strengths and I am good at talking one on one. But this past year, it’s been rough. 8-9 months ago, my long time gf and I broke up. One of the reasons was that I didn’t really want to go out and party with her and socialize very regularly like she wanted. At work recently, I’ve been told that I’m too cold and too serious. Sometimes with my friends, I stay so quiet because I don’t feel like I don’t have anything interesting to say but then I get anxious because I feel like they’re confused about why I’m not talking, and thinking that I don’t want to be there. 

 I basically feel dull and boring. I also have chronic depression for which I’m on meds. But I just feel like I’m the most boring person alive and don’t understand why anyone wants to hang out with me.

I could have the best day of my life, and the moment I lay down at night I tell myself that I'm tired, that it's OK to give up, that people would miss me, but then they'd move on with their lives. Some days I need to lie to myself and say that my death would directly cause the deaths of people I love. I lie and say that people need me. That my friend (who is also dealing with depression) couldn't continue without me. That my mom would be broken, and would wither away. I tell myself the truth that my death would set a bad example for my young niece, who has been battling depression herself.

Then, sometimes after hours of wrestling with thoughts of life vs death, I fall asleep, and the next day is a whole lot brighter, right until I lay down and turn off the lights.

Every night is a battle, if I slip, if I give up even an inch of ground, I'm another inch closer to death. Honestly, I don't know how much longer I can keep fighting. I tell myself that when my mom is gone, when my dogs are gone, maybe then I can rest. Some nights that seems like it's too far off.

I try to be a light in other people's lives. I'm not feeling the light in my own, but if I can brighten their day, encourage them, compliment them, lift them up, then I can maybe drift off to sleep without wondering if I have a purpose in the world anymore.

I know that people love me. I know that I improve the lives of people around me. I can metaphorically be the big spoon and provide comfort and shelter, and reassurance, but some days, i just need a big spoon. I need someone to hold me, and tell me my fight is worth it. 

Growing up, I knew three things, they were just built into me, before I could even understand them. Call them dreams, visions, premonitions, self-fulfilling prophecies, I don't know. What I knew was: I would smoke. I would fall in love with a dark haired, dark eyed woman, and I would die by my own hand.

I started smoking when I was 17. Then I fell in love with a blonde, quit smoking, and wondered if all three things were bunk, but after 10 years things fell apart, she no longer loved me, and I realized that maybe I never loved her the way I thought I did. That maybe I'd been lying to myself to fill a void. Now I smoke again, and have feelings I've never felt before for a dark haired, dark eyed woman, and I wonder if the third thing will happen too.

Some people could read this and assume that I'm suicidal, but I'm not. I'm tired. Every day I fight for my life, I have a will to live, and want to continue. I'm just so tired of fighting. Some days I just want to let this terminal illness win.",Life feels like a terminal illness,1562002165.0
