6,Anxiety,"3 years ago I wouldn't go to the bathroom without my phone primed to call my SO or the emergency number.

I was always kinda anxious-ish as a kid, particularly when it came to my death phobia... I refused to go on a class trip to the museum because there were mummies, I was traumatized by children's adventure movies like huckleberry finn because I hated seeing the skeletons/human remains, cried at 5 years old when I was told I too would die someday.

It all simmered down more or less as I got into my teens then twenties - and I was otherwise 'normal' albeit  a little shy/vigilant for a couple decades... then it all came to a head when I found a guy my age (late 20s) deceased in a public bathroom from natural causes - panic attacks, hypochondriac tendencies, googling heart attack symptoms and generally much more on edge. 

Luckily things have gradually improved with a few hiccups... panic attacks are very few and far between, I've gotten gradually more relaxed about being in a saveable situation should something arise, but I'm still not back to 100%.

The other day I saw I had 4 days off so I decided fuck it, I'll book a last minute trip to budapest! A few days later and here I am, at a bar as I type, drinking local craft beer after being to the outdoor hot spring pools with public changing areas, various restaurants, making small talk, and staying at a hotel - all by myself. 

A lot of my friends do the same and it's no big deal to them but for me it's a milestone in my anxiety management/recovery, I always admired their attitude and fantasised about doing the same but it was of course in an abstract idea of the future without a deadline, and wasn't pressing.

8,Anxiety,"Hi guys,

Hope you're all having a happy pre-4th of July, or happy pre-pre-Friday for others outside the US that are reading!

So I've been out of work for about 9 months (6 of which I was in a trade school for). I'm a bit of a job hopper due to what I now believe was anxiety and paranoia of my perceived performance and what others thought of me. Each job I tried to stick out for at least a year, then I'd quit because I thought I wasn't suited for the role, that my boss wished he or she had hired someone else, and that my coworkers thought I was weird and/or unlikable. Outside of traditional social anxiety and paranoia, I had insane performance anxiety that made it impossible to stick around at any of my jobs. Unfortunately the jobs I took required answering phones or performing a task in front of others, and each time I did it (hundreds of times throughout the day), I would get this mini panic attack before-hand followed by intense shame and embarrassment. They were the only types of higher paying jobs I qualified for that didn't require a degree, so felt stuck.

I couldn't take it anymore and quit to go work in a warehouse. I liked how anti-social it was and they seemed to value me despite a few poor performance reviews at first, but I got better and I seemed to shine a bit there. The only issue I had were the hours (inconsistent) and that I worked around a bunch of highschoolers and college students. They all assumed I was a college student too and it was embarrassing when I had to explain I was doing nothing else. I was a few years older than everyone which led me to pursuing a trade so I could feel proud of my job. I also got injured quite a bit there so I don't think my body can handle very physical jobs.

Pursued said trade, dropped almost $10,000 which became non-refundable after a month, and realized after a few months into it that I didn't like it. It required a ton more sales and social interaction than I thought it would, since it's a job that's more hands-on, and I wasn't a natural at it at all. This isn't my social anxiety talking, I was the worst one there. I finished everything last, my performance reviews were awful, they told me towards the end that I would be fired if I performed that way on the job, and they were considering not certifying me at all. They ended up giving me a pity certificate that didn't include a diploma and I was on my way. Applied for a job in that industry and just as I had suspected, they were pushing me to upsell and basically be a receptionist combined with my actual role. I quit after a week and have been jobless since.

I refused to take meds for a long time and tried getting better naturally, but it's been 8 (almost 9) years since I was diagnosed with performance and social anxiety and I finally went on meds yesterday. I'm hoping this helps and would really like to hear others who also have on the job performance anxiety and how you deal with it.

But I feel guilty. I feel like I shouldn't have done that, I shouldn't have broken up with him. I always check his Facebook and Twitter accounts. I feel like he's sad and going through existential crisis because I feel like I made him feel like he's a disappointment. I want to help him get through whatever he's feeling. But again, I'm scared. 

The last time we saw each other, I thought we were fine. I asked him where he was and went to meet him only to see the disappointed look on his face. He left me with his friends so I felt really embarrassed. Later that night, I told him I was sorry. He said he was sorry too because he only felt uncomfortable. I endured it because I wanted to help him. But the whole thing scarred me, I would only cry every time I remember it.

15,Anxiety,"My girlfriend of 3 years has anxiety. I've known this since we started dating. It's difficult at times, but it's also part of who she is; her over-attention to every relationship she has (friends, family, me) makes her the most caring person I know. Her extreme attention to detail has helped her excel professionally. I could go on... These are all things I love about her.

This summer, I had to relocate for work for 10 weeks. I'll be done this project in 5 weeks, and moving back to our home city shortly thereafter. But these first 5 weeks have been rough. We talk on the phone 2-4 times a day (feels like a lot to me). She randomly gets afraid that I'm going to leave her (every time she hears that a friend/acquaintance is recently single, she freaks out that it could happen to her). We had phone sex last week, and she's all of a sudden freaking out that her parents know about it (they were in another state on vacation when it happened, so this fear is completely irrational).

I've also experienced increased stress over the pass year that has resulted in stomach problems. I've never had stress or stomach problems in my life. While the start of my symptoms coincided with me starting a new job, this job is far less work/stress than my previous job. I believe that her anxiety is contributing to my newly developed stress problems. Every time she freaks out about something, I find myself getting more and more stressed about it, and less able to just blow it off. To compound the anxiety (for both of us) my girlfriend and I had been planning to get engaged this year. All of this stress and anxiety is making me feel uncomfortable with the state of the relationship right now.

My questions for the community:

* How do I explain to my girlfriend (without triggering her anxiety) that her anxiety is causing me stress?
* What can I do to help her anxiety? I'm quite understanding, but I don't want to be a stress ball that she squeezes whenever something goes wrong; I want to help her develop the tools to cope with it her herself.
* How do I deal with my own newly developed stress problems?

Some other random things:

* My girlfriend has been on anxiety medication in the past, but hasn't been on it for the past two years. The drug made her tired, loss of appetite, weight gain, and just not herself. She was fine without the drugs and seen improvement with a healthier lifestyle (sleep, diet, fitness). But, the past 6-9 months have been difficult for me, and last 5 weeks have been rough.
* She has not gone to a therapist since we started dating. She's talked about it before, but I don't believe her current health insurance covers a therapist. My new health plan does have some mental health benefits. I have not yet taken advantage of them, but I fully intend to when I return home next month.",Dating someone with anxiety,1562171607.0

18,Anxiety,"I was supposed to recieve a parcel form UPS today but its led to me feeling so overwhelmed all because something has gone wrong. When I told my friend they thought I was acting crazy so is it normal for someone with an anxiety disorder that leaves them 99% house bound and unable to talk on phones to get worked up over something like this?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what happened in more detail. I noticed a black van pull up in the lay by outside my house, vans and cars always pull up there but because I was expecting a parcel I got up and started pacing around as I usually do waiting to get the ""alright mate, thank you, see you"" out the way with, but 5 minutes went by and he was still sat there in his van so I thought it must just be a random van, another 5 minuets passed and he drove off, then a few minuets later I was wondering if my delievery was close by so I went on amazon tracking and it said ""Delivery attempt, Stoke GB"" and then right after ""Delivered, Stoke GB"" But I don't live in stoke... Now I start to panic a bit because I don't know what to do and I'm going to have to take action that I'm extremely unconfortable with. I then went outside and forced myself to go into my neigbors yard to see if it was left there by a door but it wasn't, so then I did something that I've never done and kind of feel proud that I pushed myself to do it but I knocked on my neighbors door, there was no answer so I came back in and used the UPS tracking code in UPS's tracker on their site instead and it says ""you may now pickup your package at the listed UPS Access Point"", at first I thought okay well I have done that once before and I know where that is but then I checked the adress of the access point and its somewhere I've never been, I don't know where it is and even if I look on google maps I don't know the layout, I don't know the entrance and whether its obvious or not, its a sports center so I dont know if its going to be busy or anything. So now I'm sat here and I don't know what to do, I'm thinking of just spending another ¬£50 and hoping the next delivery goes better... People don't understand how hard the littlest things can be for someone like me, so now I'm just depressed really, the anxiety has gone down to a much more managable level because I'm not planning on going to pick it up, I'm not depressed because I lost ¬£50, it's because no one understands and the fact that a lot of things people do with little effort are really difficult for me.

I guess this was just a rant really, but like I said I'd like to know if you have simular experiences with deliveries?

22,Anxiety,"I don't know if any of you can relate to this, but ever since I have moved into my house last year I have had to put up with this loud, chav family that live 2 doors down from me. The worst of their behavior is usually during the summer when their kids are screaming or crying at the top of their lungs in the garden and the poor excuse of a Dad shouting 'which one of you shits has taken one of my beers, I swear I'll wrap this belt round your neck' and not to mention their dog barking uncontrolably. 


It is impossible to have a quiet day on my own when all I want to do is sit peacefully in the sun in my garden with no distractions.

25,Anxiety,"Hey everyone, I have had generalized anxiety, OCD, and agoraphobia essentially since I can remember. There is always something on my mind that I obsess about can sometimes take over my ability to function regularly. I have been coping fairly well with it for a while now and recently graduated college, but for the past few years I've been having these week-month long episodes where I can't stop thinking about how strange it is that we live on a planet just floating in space.

My recent bout was triggered by traveling to Mexico and freaking out how I was so far away from home and thinking about my family on the other side of North America is standing upright in a different direction.

26,Anxiety,"So FYI, Im going to a counselor in a few weeks because something is obviously wrong.

Not too long ago I started talking to 2 girls. One added me on snapchat and the other is a fellow youtuber. Both conversations were advice, talking about their job, etc. Just small talk nothing more. Now my anxiety has led me to believe that even this is cheating because I was doing it without her knowledge.

Well she found out, accused me of cheating and now everything is tense. I know in my head nothing happened. No flirting, no nudes, nothing sexual. They both know I have a girlfriend and I make it clear that I do. ""Oh yeah my gf and I should do that sometime"" ""Oh yeah my gf and I yada yada"" Like I make it clear. These girls know. The one is in a different country and has a bf of her own. Everything is clear.

But I still hid it from her and now naturally she is upset and I totally understand why. Idk if it's from my last relationship? Rooted into my childhood? Idk. All I know is I felt the need to actively hide it from her because I know she does get a little jealous and I just dont want to have to be put into a spot like that. She is the only girl i need to talk to but talking to other people is ok too, my gf knows this and says I shouldve just told her because now it looks fishy. Understandable. I should've. 

I just am scared of losing her and dont want it to be because I am uncomfortable being put into positions like that despite not doing anything morally wrong besides lying. It sucks because I literally screwed myself. If I was sexting or something, sure. But just talking and I was too uncomfortable to let her know? Ugh. The best way I found to deal with avoiding a situation like this is I deactivated my instagram and deleted nearly everyone on snapchat. I know this makes it seem like I'm hiding stuff but I dont care. Whatever keeps me far away from having this happen again because just thinking about it gets me anxious. It's boneheaded but I'm pretty sure I had this problem with my ex as well. Talk to somebody, delete, talk to somebody, delete. Delete all broswer history always. Delete everything. Idk if I dont trust MYSELF or what. ANy talking is cheating? Idk. She talks to guys and idc. I have alot to work on.

I never had anxiety until now. I'm 25 years old and literally have had a panic attack now and my anxiety is getting out of control. Idk why and I was in denial for so long. I just hope I didnt screw myself.

I live opposite a school in a cul de sac, so the driver picked their child up from school and turned around in the cul de sac which is when she hit my car. Luckily enough, the damage to my car is tiny, but what has pissed me off is that she knew she hit my car.

38,Anxiety,"Hi sorry I tried to keep this short but it was too hard. Basically I‚Äôm 23m and have been suffering from something my whole life. I was a hyperactive behaviour problem child, calmed down (held shit in) in high school then fell in a proper depressed state between 17-20 and never seeked any help, I got over the worst of it somehow.  

Now it‚Äôs 3 years later and I still hate everything about my life. Despite telling myself I‚Äôm better and got over whatever was happening in my later teen years. I struggle talking to anyone.

I‚Äôve been speaking to my old best friend who I pushed out of my life when I was in a bad way. He‚Äôs been having problems himself and I think speaking to him has made me realise it‚Äôs time to do something about myself. I missed him so much and regret everything I‚Äôve done to him over the years but just him seeking me out to talk about his issues really hit me hard. 

Like wtf am I doing. I dropped out of school, ditched him to go get high with this equally insane girl, deleted him from fb when he tried to reach out and never saw him for years. I fucked up my education and now work in a job I genuinely hate and dread going into everyday. 

Anyway speaking to him has convinced me it‚Äôs time to seek help. I was so hyped up for it yesterday and had planned to go tomorrow. Now I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to go. I haven‚Äôt been to a gp since I was 16, I don‚Äôt even know how it works. I‚Äôm scared to talk about myself and I don‚Äôt have a clue what to say. I always hear about people‚Äôs shitty experiences.

Or I‚Äôll go and it‚Äôll be horrible and still have to continue suffering. How can I convince myself to go?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post but it covers like 6 months of my life,  I guess I'm just kind of throwing it out there and hoping someone who is/was in a similar position understands. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26(M).  Just as some context, I have anxiety induced agoraphobia, there were entire years where I didn't go outside for longer than a few minutes at a time.

I became morbidly obese (275lbs, 5'10)  due to no exercise, the anxiety mixed with the lack of needing to be social in any way just made me eat to feel good because I didn't even care about the next day, I just wanted a short period of feeling good and had no reason to care about my looks because nobody would see me anyway.

I had a bunch of bad habits such as biting my nails/skin, not showering or washing for long periods of time, just generally not taking care of myself.

All of these things made me feel horrible, making me want to not go outside even more, and my anxiety would just raise further, and I'd then right go back to my ""coping mechanism"" of avoiding the problem entirely by pretending I don't exist... And then I'd further my bad habits again and again, each time just reinforcing the loop and making it harder to break out of.

This continued for 6 years, eventually adding up to ""I'll just kill myself if I have to"" being the main thing in my head every day, I'm not sure if I was suicidal, or I had just given up completely. I don't remember wanting to die, but I kind of accepted it as that's what I'd do. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm not religious at all, But I one day came across a random YouTube video on autoplay, and I just listened. 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aFQ5LIOnH4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aFQ5LIOnH4) 

It made me realise, if someone does look down upon me while I'm outside (maybe call me names, or laugh at me, whatever), it reflects horrifically on them, they're a bad person. I don't even want to speak with them ever again, why should I care? It says so much about them, but nothing about me, they'll just be throwing words at me, and I know that means they are dealing with their own problems, so much so they drown in it and throw them at me to try offload some hate.

I started going on this rabbit hole of self help videos, Jordan Peterson was another HUGE help making me realize things. 

One line absolutely slaughtered me when I heard it, I cried hard.

""There's no virtue in being a victim."" 

I was a victim, of myself inflicted depression and a rough early life, but that wouldn't do ANYTHING for me, nobody will ""save"" me, nobody will be able to magically fix it, even if  I pay them, no matter what, being a victim will not help me at all, no circumstances could possibly arise where me being a victim would ever solve this mentality I had that made me perpetually depressed. I was a victim because I was a victim in the past, and that was another endless feedback loop I had to break.

&amp;#x200B;

I  decided I'd start going outside, I bought myself a new pair of jeans..Size 42, I could BARELY fit into them and they were elasticated too, but it felt good to wear ""normal"" clothes for the first time in years.  I paired it with a hoodie, I figured it would ""hide"" the most.

I woke up at 5am and went out around 6AM, I felt insanely anxious the entire time, the night before I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. 

But I went outside, 30 seconds into my journey.. and I felt fine, like totally fine, until I saw other people walking towards me, I didn't even know what I would say because it had been so long. They said ""Good morning"" and I said it back, it felt SO normal, like I was just a normal person and everything was fine, it felt like I was ""faking"" it almost because it was so easy. I didn't even think, it just happened.

I went out the next day, the day after that, sometimes going in different directions, exploring a little. Each time, if I had to say ""Good morning"", it just happened naturally. 

Eventually I went out at a ""normal"" time, like 2PM.  There were cars this time, I had to use the traffic lights and ""deal"" with hundreds of people driving past me, but I didn't even care. 

This is where the ""third agreement"" really helped, I didn't make assumptions, I just walked and they were just driving past. They weren't judging me, because I had no reason to believe they were, there was no proof.  Even if someone did, they never said it to me, so I would never know anyway.

In all my times walking outside, I've never had a bad experience, all my anxieties and worries about people making fun of me never even happened, not even one person was even slightly rude. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started dieting too, working out and lifting weights (at home). Going out for a daily walk added something to a ""routine"", I had an actual **reason** to shower, a **reason** to wear better clothes, a **reason** to keep my diet up because I knew people would see me.

5 Months of this passed, I didn't go out every day, I didn't work out every day, I had some days where I didn't stick to my diet, but I tried to make sure I did at least one of the three in a day so no day was a ""loss"", but at worst a neutral day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started getting courage to go to the local supermarket, it was almost always busy with queues, so I'd often go in the mornings. Eventually I ""got"" it, I just hand them the money, say thank you, place the stuff in a bag and leave. 

Nothing bad ever happened, nobody judged what I was buying, questioned me or said anything. It just went fine every time. I even forgot an item once, I turned around and went back, the same cashier didn't even say anything, I just bought it. In my mind this was like the equivalent of climbing mount Everest. It was like admitting I did something wrong in public, having to admit it to someone, like I'd look stupid in front of everyone. But it didn't really work out that way,  I just had to be a tiny bit vulnerable, but for some reason feeling vulnerable made me feel stronger, like I could admit I was wrong, and that was okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I had to do something bigger though, I had to make myself an appointment in the city, where I'd have to go on the bus, talk to people, give my information, hand over some papers and then actually do the actual appointment, buy something and leave. 

I don't even know how I did this, but I just asked questions. Every single thing I did I asked questions. 

 I asked the bus driver for a single ticket, he told me an all day pass would be cheaper if I'm coming back, I mumbled a ""yeah.."" He said ""what?"" and I said ""yeah that's fine"" and I got an all day pass.

Eventually I arrived in the city like 45 minutes too early, which was lucky because I had no idea where I was going anyway.  But for some reason, with Google maps, it was all so easy? I just looked at the map if I was confused, that was it.  Someone even asked ME for directions, I  had no idea what I was even doing! I just looked it up on my phone and showed them, they said thanks and went off.

 I was trying to walk around with ""confidence"" with my head held high, shoulders back, standing up straight,  so maybe I didn't look lost? I don't know, but it made me feel so good that someone approached me. 

Eventually I sat in the city center for 30 minutes, it was oddly relaxing because others were doing it too, I then went in when they opened, answered all the questions, it wasn't even awkward! I don't get it? My heart the night before was literally about to implode, I had 3 hours of restless and sweaty sleep, I was seriously thinking of cancelling. 

I was a little confused, I asked questions..They just helped me? People were nice, they didn't judge me for being confused, they just helped. Almost like they were happy to help?  I just don't get it, it's like my nightmare to talk to people but for some reason everything is fine when I actually do it, and they're nice and understanding. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got the bus back, it went so well, everything just worked, I showed them my ticket, and got on at the back, checked google maps, got off when I needed to..It just went fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I had to prove to myself it wasn't a one off, I know I'm capable of being somehow magically okay with things when I have to, but I had to prove to myself I could go to the city again by choice. 

The second time I went during the weekend, at 10am, it was very busy. Around 10 people were queued for the bus.

This time went even better, I asked for the all day ticket right away this time, I didn't even feel slightly nervous during any of the trip, in fact I felt confident walking around, I went into a huge shop full of greeters and said hello to them, even the journey back from the busy city center was fine. I did kind of rush home after 45 minutes of exploring, as I had no real purpose to be there..But the main thing was taking the trip there and back.

Everything just felt so much better when I was outside, when I was actually doing it..It was just, easy? All the problems I possibly thought of in my head didn't happen, everything went so smooth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now we get to today, I had decided I didn't really want therapy, I knew therapy would lead to them telling me to go out more, I knew the only way was to just go out. It's just the only solution to my problems. Just meet people, even if it's so awkward I struggle, I just had to do SOMETHING to actually have a conversation with someone. 

I had to be vulnerable, I just had to be open and if someone asked I had to tell them the truth. I needed a place where I could say what I mean, and people would understand that I've had struggles, and I'm just there to try something new.

I decided a church was really the only choice,  I'm not religious, I've never even been to a church properly, I had NO idea what was going to happen. All I knew was I'd be forced outside of my comfort zone, I'd meet new people, I'd probably have to at least have a chat with someone at some point, about anything! Even a 30 second chat where I ask a question is more than I've EVER had with a stranger in the past 6 years of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The people were so welcoming, I mean really they seemed happy to see me, I can't even remember the last time I felt that.

They guided me through everything, were very polite and waited until I got it and let me read and follow along, even if I didn't join in. I was just happy to be experiencing something new.

I ended up having small chats with people, about the obvious things they'd ask (are you religious, what do you know about X) , some asked me about myself so I told them the truth, I was vulnerable and in public, I told them I had anxiety, I told them about some family problems and told them I had problems with my weight.

I was awkward, there was some awkward silences, some ""what sorry?"" times, there were even times I didn't pick up on some non-verbal social cues. But everyone was nice and understanding,  I just asked questions. I let them do most of the talking, and if they asked me a question I responded truthfully.

They even told me about some of their problems, one person said they had to have a surgery recently, another having trouble making friends. It felt nice to know I'm not the only one with problems.

When I was leaving everyone was waving bye, telling me to come again soon. 

I'll go again, hopefully to the Sunday service when there's more people.

I'm actually excited to go outside. I can't believe it.

54,Anxiety,"(First off: I'm currently on 150 mg of Wellbutrin and 150mg of Lamictal, and just recently got back on 5mg of Lexapro. I was hoping to wean off the Lamictal (assuming the Lexapro worked out) since I've always felt that particular med overly ""flattens"" my moods, but I guess I'll have to stay on it for the time being. 

Also, I'm not sure if this is the right sub to ask this question so please let me know if there is a more appropriate subreddit to post this in!)

I used to be on Lexapro a while back and took it for years. Lexapro was a godsend for my social and generalized anxiety but my libido was extremely low so I eventually dropped it. I then switched to Wellbutrin and WOW what a difference!! (I was horny pretty much anytime I wasn't sleeping)

The Wellbutrin and Lamictal are definitely helping with my depression/moods and aren't making my anxiety levels worse, but they also aren't decreasing them, so I got back on 5 mg of Lexapro in hopes that the Wellbutrin would counteract the libido-decreasing effects of the Lexapro. Now my mood and anxiety levels are better than ever but of course the libido is kaput again; I thought 5mg would be low enough of a dose to prevent this but woe is me :/

The thing is, I haven't found any other type of antidepressant save for SSRIs which effectively counter my anxiety. For those who had libido issues on Lexapro (or Zoloft), did you manage to find an SSRI which combated the anxiety while leaving your libido relatively intact? If so, which one? If not SSRIs, did you find any other meds which helped? I've also tried Buspar in the past and didn't notice an effect on libido in either direction, but I also wasn't on Lexapro at the time.

58,Anxiety,"This is a pointless story, I just wanted to vent out my frustrations, dont expect anything valuble.

Bottom line is, I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, pretty much all my childhood and teenage years and it has almost destroyed me, but managed to fight it off the last couple of years.

I used to be the scared little teenager that didnt really believe I could manage a life for myself, without any help. I couldnt even fathom the idea of taking an exam in school.

Then it all happened for me at once - I put anxiety completely aside, my confidence, that I otherwise only had in my internet persona due to anonymity - to real life.

I aced my exams without being scared, I moved out for myself, I got my drivings license etc. could speak with other people no problems, I finally became a normal person. All by myself. I used to otherwise be dependant on my family.

I felt great. I didnt care about anxiety anymore. I accepted who I am, and that's how my self-esteem got higher, my confidence got higher, I believed in myself and who I can become, what my potentials really are in this world, and with all those things combined, anxiety goes away.

Then it happened.. the thing that I feared. Losing control over my progress.

I started having a major crush on some girl I went to school with, and that put my control completely off. I started feeling the anxiety all over again. How am I supposed to talk to her, tell her what I feel, am I expecting a relationship now? etc etc. all this started going through my head, and before I know it.. I'm back to having those damned heart pumping anxiety attacks.

Feeling that kind of love towards a girl, made me lose all common sense and rationality.

Then my confidence came down. Then my self-esteem got butchered. She is definitely a tad above my league, or maybe I just overestimate her looks because I have a crush. (probably). but when you consider someone to be way prettier than you deserve, it automatically makes self-esteem to go down to shit.

Anyways, at some party where all my chances were, I botched them completely and ended up doing nothing, not even say goodbye even though I'm not going to see her again, because I was scared of the entire situation. I was scared of getting embarrassed. I had anxiety. Again.

Prior to that party + while it was going, we were texting almost all the time. I dont know if she knew I liked her, but I wasnt really good at hiding it either, she must have known something atleast.

A couple of days after the party, I fought through anxiety, and decided to confess that I liked her. But it was over text. Yeah... so she did not respond whatsoever, basically disappeard. Probably never cared for me in the first place - and thats fine. It's understandable, because girls mostly likes confidence. And I was confident when I met her, and that's what made me get her number in the first place, but when anxiety kicked in, that's where I got fucked. 

Either way, I can move on from her.

But what I can't seem to move on from is how much this situation has killed off what I thought I was.

It made me realise, that no matter how far I've come in my life, I thought I had cured my anxiety... it came crawling back, when I actually needed it to be gone. That one girl managed to make me second guess myself and hate myself.

Atleast I still have my progress in life. I still dont feel dependant on anyone else to be able to live day-to-day... but I would be lying, if I said this didnt take a hit on me, after anxiety basically fucked me up, once again.

Oh well... lesson learned, the hard way. If there is a next time, I'll make sure to fight through this garbage to actually get things done and not let it waste further of my life and time and happiness.

80,Anxiety,"I was on 3MG of Klonopin for 6 weeks. It was amazing. For the first time in my life I was able to control my anxiety, interact with customers, etc. I started off on 2mg and told my doctor ""This really isn't helping me that much. I think I'd have to take 4mg a day for it to last all day"" She bumped it up to 3mg and after a few days of being on it I felt great.

&amp;#x200B;

In the psych ward, the doctor wanted to put me on 0.5mg of Klonopin and did so for four days. I convinced him to give me at least 2mg of Klonopin because I told him the list of drugs I've been on and how I've been having panic attacks for 9 years (constant twitching, fidgeting, shaking, sweating, almost all day) and I finally found something that helped me after trying 15 different meds and 7 therapists, meditation, eating right, and frequent exercise,

&amp;#x200B;

My parents forced me to  voluntarily sign in to a psych ward because they were going to kick me out if I didn't go. They told the emergency room workers I said I was going to kill myself and left me there when I said ""no, I said I had suicidal idealations but I never said I was going to hurt myself"". I shook a bottle of pills in front of them when I was pissed off at them and said ""how many pills should I take today to feel happy"". They called the police on me. My dad got in my face and started yelling at me a bit later when we met up in the hallway and I said ""maybe I'll be gone forever then"". He called the police again. My mother told the police about me wanting to break a bucket I wanted to either buy a car and insure it this week and let them hold onto the keys, or use my brother's car to take my driver's ed exam, so I could get my license that week. (My doctor took me too fast off my Effexor and I was agitated during the days this was occurring which contributed partly to my behavior most likely) . Instead I spent 9 days in a psych ward until they decided they'd pick me up (I was only supposed to stay 2-4 days but they told the doctors all of these stories about me and then at the last minute said they couldn't pick me up on Friday and you can't get discharged on the weekends)

Now  I'm back home. I went to see my psych doctor. I've told her I've smoked pot before and taken mushrooms a couple of times. She won't give me back my anxiety medication because she said ""it's addictive"". I told her I have no criminal history and have never been hooked on drugs, and that people take up to 20mg a day of it. I asked her why she'd change a dose that was working for me. I couldn't get a response from her.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do because I don't have the time and money to visit a bunch of psychiatrists, to find one that is willing to give me back my 3mg dose of Klonopin. I don't know if there is some way I can explain the situation to one and say ""look, this is what happened. This is the drug that helped me. I've tried 15 different drugs for 9 years. I used to use pot in college but have only used it twice in the past few years, and I drink maybe 3 times a year. I'm not a drug addict. I don't have a criminal background. When I was on 3mg the constant state of anxiety stopped and people started treating me differently when I didn't have constant nervous twitches or a scared look on my face. I was actually starting to feel happy for the first time in a long time.

How do I find a psychiatrist that is willing to give me the dose back that's worked for me? Do I disclose my previous medical history to them?

My gut instinct is telling me that she's either keeping me on the 2mg because she doesn't want to take responsibility/lose her license if something happens to me while I'm on 3mg, or the fact that pot showed up in my drug test at the hospital because I had smoked for the first time in a year and a half so she considers me a 'drug abuser' now and thinks the Klonopin is just another way for me to get high.",Advice on getting my meds back?

However this has the exact opposite effect of what I want to achieve and my legs start trembling (sort of like how it is in extreme cold) automatically.

93,Anxiety,"I‚Äôve dealt with an anxiety disorder since middle school and unfortunately it impacts a lot of areas of my life. Certain things are triggers, including money, and from that, my job. For whatever reason, money really triggers my anxiety. Making it, spending it, budgeting. I‚Äôve always been a penny pincher, mainly because my mom instilled it in me. My parents never exactly showed away from making their issues known to us as kids, so I heard all about money problems and stuff as a kid. When I was in college, my dad was laid off. My mom had been laid off years before, but we were going off of my dads paycheck. So with no income, things were tight as my parents looked for jobs. My sister was in grad school, and my mom would tell me that I would potentially have to drop out of college and work full time to support the family. On top of other issues that made things worse. 

I‚Äôve loosened up a lot since then, but it‚Äôs still a huge stressor for me. I‚Äôm still a bit of a penny pincher, but it‚Äôs gotten better. I was laid off of my last job, and unfortunately the area I live in has virtually no job market for my field, so I had to take a job with a $13k paycut. My monthly pay changes based on how many field jobs I can snag, as I get extra money for that. So that also seriously puts me into anxiety mode, because I have to struggle against jerky coworkers just to make decent pay.

So this kinda starts from when I smoked weed in highschool. I'm 24 now, but at 15-17 I smoked weed, spice, and eventually salvia. After the salvia I couldnt smoke weed without having a severe panic attack that lasted for idk how long. I smoked cigs to calm me down (doesnt help really) and went to a counselor. That actually really helped cause my anxiety gave me somewhat agoraphobia so getting out of the house was nice. I started taking medication (4mg of alprazolam extended release.) I dont abuse the pills. What I do is abuse alcohol. It seems to be the only thing that ""cancels"" my anxiety. I know I've been doing am idiotic thing and I want to not rely on alcohol to fix my issue. I mean I carry a flask everywhere i go just in case. I feel shitty that I'm self medicating.

I've known for about two years that I have anxiety (before that I didn't know everyone enjoyed a more calm and normal lifestyle). 

But these are the irrational anxious thoughts I have everyday:

Am I spending my waking hours making the most effective choices, as if eating lunch at 11 or 12 matters. I should've spent my time being more productive. I could've started three new healthy habits today, but instead I just got by. What's wrong with my me. I'm wasting my time. 

Why do I have no energy. Am I anemic. Why didn't I use that money to buy vitamins today. I'm so stupid for prioritizing my wants over needs. Such an idiot. 

Am I slowly screwing up friendships because of lack of communication. Is it all just downhill from me and irreparable. Why bother. I feel like a fake for contacting old friends. I will make the same mistake again in the future. 

Am I spending too much money on X, Y or Z (even when I have all my money budgeted and it's not possible to overspend). You're a fucking idiot when it comes to money. You always do it wrong and you will never be ahead of the game. 



Everyday. And I never feel content. I will even block out things that I need to do and pretend they don't exist for just a bit so I can pretend to feel good about my situation and choices. 

I used to think I had such high confidence, and I realize the negative self talk I put on myself all day now. It's awful. I hate it. And I hate myself for doing it. But it doesn't stop.

127,Anxiety,"If I can help even one person with my post, or just find someone who can relate, I'll feel accomplished for the evening.

Anyone who's actually overcome their battle (well.. do you ever really?) is probably laughing at my naivety and recalling a time when they may have felt the same way. 

I'm an early 20s male for context. Yet I eel like a child still. Afraid I always will...

I've had dark moments. The darkest was certainly collapsing on the sidewalk of a road that crossed over a small stream, feeling embarassed and invisible as cars drove by in the night. I was leaning against a short wall of concrete made cold by the wintery night, feeling the frostbite consume my ungloved hands, as I called my friends crying that I felt like jumping over or just staying there and waiting for hypothermia to claim me. 

A few weeks later, they briefly stopped communicating with me citing the overwhelming pressure of being my only outlet. Was it the best way? I don't think. It will forever hurt not having friends for a month. But it's been three months since, and I just hung out with them yesterday. Had a lot of fun for half the day. Was feeling normal. Was feeling that *they* thought I was normal. Was feeling like one of the guys. I love my friends and always will. Then one of them made a comment about a hang out they had while not speaking with me. Instant mood shifter (I thought I had that shit normalized). 

I shut down for the rest of the night. Became a recluse. I guess I was waiting for someone to just hug me and tell me it was gonna be okay. I always am waiting for that. I get the feeling I'll be waiting 10 lifetimes.

Ended up crying in front of one friend at the end of the night. Some jazz about nobody loving me, about how I'll never be loved by anybody, and how I'm pathetic. Looking back on it, hey, I feel pathetic! Was clearly afraid that this would show them that I actually hadn't made any progress and that I couldn't be trusted to not have a breakdown and make them feel uncomfortable...feel the pressure to turn my day around like always.

My friend told me there was nothing to fix. Not to dwell on this. And next time is a clean slate. Then he gave me a hug (with a small prompt; a few minutes after I suggested a slew of things that would make me feel better). He gently rubbed my shoulder. I don't know why, but that small detail is engrained in my head, and has helped calm me down all of today. I felt so connected to him right then. And most importantly, I felt loved without the words having to be said. Is that just my own wild interpretation? Does it matter? I felt it. I felt like someone who mattered.

Yeah, I had a setback. But it hasn't ruined everything. And I'm still going. 

I'll have more setbacks. But I'll keep going. And so will you, wherever you are. I'll send you a virtual hug if you need it.",Realizing this is a much longer journey than I was hoping it would be,1562132644.0

129,Anxiety,"I don't know if this have ever happened to you. Have you ever felt all alone in this world with no one to talk to? You know no one will be able to help you. You cant help yourself because your anxiety is taking over your life. You push everyone away. Surprisingly, caring too much is extremely annoying to everyone around you.

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much going on in your head and so much you want to say but you always think whatever you say is going to be the wrong thing. Your anxiety and the art of your mind of twisting things and worrying you  before anything comes out does such great wonders that even the people who are supposed to be your support system cannot take it anymore and they give up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Family is just a shit show. No support from that area. Actually weirdly enough, you are their support system so there's that. Job sucks so bad every single day, you want to quit but you cannot because if you do, you wont be able to support your family for what they need.

You are obviously not capable enough to live on your own because duh u can not hold any friends  of your own and the only friends u have are your support system. It is understandable that they did not sign up for this and they do not need your shit so you decide to just back away and let them be but what will you do now?

&amp;#x200B;

Someone might say, ""Then why won't you try to find a partner?"" , "" If you have such an issue with staying alone, you should just go out and look for friends. "", "" Ohh, you are so upbeat and social when you are in a public capacity  but when it comes to your personal life you always say that you didn't know what to say  make an ""excuse"" that its your social anxiety."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Who will go and explain to them that in a public capacity, you know you are not going to meet that person again and so anything you say or do will not affect your standing with them and neither do you care. It's the people you care about, the people you like and want them to like you back that you worry yourself over. 

&amp;#x200B;

The more you care about or feel close to a person,  the more your head starts worrying and getting paranoid. At that point, worrying just becomes a vicious cycle and 90% of the time, you  end up doing the exact thing you intended to avoid and worried so much in trying to figure out a way on how to prevent. Something as small as a sneeze ends up in a full blown flu and you end up losing them. 

&amp;#x200B;

How many times, you must have heard "" stop playing the victim"" , "" stop making excuses and just take responsibility for your actions for once"", "" you need to learn how to talk you cant always make the same excuse"".  For everyone around, you are just a big fat liar who is flaky and fickle. 

&amp;#x200B;

People never believe you when you say that your intentions were pure and there was no malice behind them. But then again, why would they? It's not like this is the first time you have said something that completely voids the person you are otherwise.  Time and again, you have done and said things to hurt them or show them that you are not who you say you are. You are just a hoax.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all you have now finally pulled the last straw and the only kinda like a support system you had is also fed up and refuses to acknowledge you as anyone to them. They wont say it but you know its over. You cant go to them for support anymore. No family, no friends, no abilities of making any more friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

No loved ones whatsoever. This is your life and you have to still support the minds of three individuals namely your family. They should not find out what you are going through. 

&amp;#x200B;

So you lost them too. Only if you could tell them how much you actually loved them for being who they are and for what they do for you without sounding extremely creepy and weird , things might get better.

134,Anxiety,"Backstory: I (23F) have GAD, OCD, and depression. I‚Äôve been on medication since college, which has led to me living a basically normal life.

I got engaged a few months ago, and my fianc√© (23M)‚Äôs parents are making life very hard for us. They don‚Äôt like me and have been interfering in our relationship in various ways. First they tried to convince him not to marry me, and insisted he should go to my doctor to hear from the source about my mental illness, symptoms, treatment plan, etc. They claim they‚Äôve now given up on that and want to come to our wedding, but are trying to emotionally blackmail us into moving the wedding date. Whenever we talk to them, they yell and verbally/emotionally abuse us.

When they were demanding my medical history, I experienced a new level of anxiety. I felt as though I wasn‚Äôt breathing properly whenever I thought about them and the stress they were putting us through. It was almost like I forgot to breathe, or forgot to breathe deeply enough. It would give me an instant headache and make my heart race.

Eventually this led to my first ever panic attack, which was mild but enough to convince me to take a step back and take better care of myself. I went to the doctor, described how my breathing was fucky and my heart was racing (my pulse was 123 at the doctor‚Äôs, sitting still) and he prescribed me beta blockers. They‚Äôre great and have helped to ease my anxiety, but despite lowering our contact with my fianc√©‚Äôs parents and a couple months passing since the first incident, my breathing problem has not gone away.

138,Anxiety,"Hi there, I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember (I‚Äôm mid 20‚Äôs currently). It has definitely ebbed and flowed for my whole life, and was at its worst a couple of years ago. Luckily I got the severe panic attacks and other terrible symptoms under control with the help of therapy and meds. I‚Äôm doing pretty well these days but the anxiety definitely spikes in stressful situations, although not at all as bad as it was a couple years ago. 

Anyway, I have cried super easily my whole life and I hate it. It‚Äôs mostly the fact that I tear up when my feelings are hurt that really bothers me. I don‚Äôt mean someone being super rude to me or anything like that, but I tend to tear up even if someone just takes a snippy tone with me or gives me criticism. I have no problem taking ownership for mistakes or anything, but it definitely ignited some panicking for me. For example when I was a kid, I would tear up if a teacher simply just shushed me or told me to stop doing something, even if they weren‚Äôt yelling or taking an aggressive tone. I don‚Äôt think something quite that minor would make me tear up now, but I still tear up very easily in similar situations. Like if I‚Äôm at work and I‚Äôm made to feel like I made a mistake or someone takes an unkind tone, I can‚Äôt help but have my eyes well up and I just feel awful and tend to keep thinking about the situation. 

It really bothers me because the more rational part of my brain will tell me that it‚Äôs ok, you can‚Äôt control how other people feel or react, their attitude is not my fault, take this as a learning experience, etc etc. It just makes me SO anxious and I tear up.  It‚Äôs a stupid physical response I can‚Äôt help. My face gets hot and my heart pounds and I just feel awful and my eyes well up. 

I just started working at a new job and I deal with people much more than I have in my previous roles.

I believe I suffer from body dysmorphia primarily as a result of living in Los Angeles surrounded by impossible (and surgically altered) beauty standards as well as social media always shoving highly curated accounts of perfect looking women in our faces.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been the most confident person ever, but lately, it seems to be getting worse. I'm not sure if I've actually gained weight since the last time I felt comfortable in a bathing suit or not. Basically, I'm questioning my reality and if I'm seeing myself as I really am in the mirror. My friends, family, and boyfriend all think I'm way too hard on myself and tell me I'm beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a very normal weight, some may even say thin, but I just don't see myself that way. I do not suffer from any type of disordered eating. I try to eat as healthy as possible, but indulge fairly often and don't restrict myself much but lately I find myself feeling more guilt surrounding my indulgences and wondering if the women I see with the ideal bodies ever indulge like this, I think to myself that they must not and I should be more disciplined. I'm worried about going down a dark path when it comes to an unhealthy relationship with food, but I wouldn't say I'm quite there yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't work out nearly as much as I should and the fact of the matter is that if I did, I probably could easily achieve a body I'm more confident with, but I have the hardest time being motivated and just continue to hate on my body without doing anything about it. I definitely will start working out more just for health reasons and to manage my anxiety, but I'm sure if I got more toned, I'd still find things to be insecure about, so I want to get to the source and find out how to be confident with myself no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to the beach with a bunch of friends on the 4th of July and I want to just be excited to spend time with friends and have fun but instead, I'm panicking about being in a bathing suit. The last time I went to the beach with this crew, I didn't even bring a bathing suit and everyone else was in their suits just enjoying themselves and I was envious of that and not even paying attention to their bodies. I'm sure they all have their own insecurities and no one had ""perfect"" bodies. I decided this time, I want to join everyone else and wear a bathing suit and face my fears.

I notice that for a long period I would get so depressed I would be indifferent about my health, like who cares, my life isn't worth anything anyhow. 

But the more I've challenged this feeling, the more anxiety I start to feel. Now that I am willing to consider a better future for myself, now I see every possible threat to it. I become more like a hypochondriac and I catastrophize about everything. Trying to control for things I suppose.

If I give into the fear too much I dip back into depressive feelings of futility. And the cycle starts again. The only way I feel I can break it is to keep going despite how anxious I am.

I don‚Äôt want to live in fear, man.

164,Anxiety,"My anxiety usually centers around phobias or obsessions. These phobias usually stick with me for years at a time. The most prominent and difficult phobia I‚Äôve faced is a fear of going crazy, a fear of developing schizophrenia.

This fear/obsession fist emerged when I was 16. I am now almost 23. In my years dealing with this specific phobia I‚Äôve made some great progress. I‚Äôve seen some very helpful therapists and gotten on medication. Over-all, I‚Äôve been doing much better than I was when I first developed the phobia.

One specific event, though, has made progress very difficult over the past year. My best friend of many years developed schizophrenia last summer. His personality changed considerably, to the point where it is now hard to recognize him and connect with him as I used to. He‚Äôs become unpredictable, aggressive, and delusional. It has been a really difficult year for me because I feel immense fear when I see what he is going through and I also feel a sense of loss and grief because the friend I knew doesn‚Äôt seem to be there anymore.

I know this is a disease that many suffer with. It is not my intention to stigmatize those who suffering with it or dehumanize anyone. I know that my friend, and all those who suffer with schizophrenia, have value and deserve love. My wish is only to express my feelings, which are complicated.

It is hard for me to feel love for or kinship with my friend. Being with him triggers my fears and causes me a lot of stress, grief and anxiety. Being with him is hard for me, so I have begun to distance myself from him. I felt fear before coming home from school for the summer because I knew I would be in close proximity to him. I feel a lot of guilt for having these feelings and for distancing myself from him. I also feel guilt for not being there for his family.

We were very close. I had never considered the possibility of us loosing touch or becoming distant. I assumed we would be friends for the rest of our lives. It is hard for me to reconcile those facts of our past friendship with my recent actions and feelings. It is hard for me to believe that I loved him as much as I did because I have not acted with love towards him recently.

So I am in conflict. I feel both the need to protect my mental wellbeing, and the need to be there for my friend. I feel grief for the loss of a friend, but also feel that that grief is unjustified because that friend is still living.

Right now I‚Äôm sitting in bed and my chest feels like a witch‚Äôs cauldron of emotions; churning, churning, churning. It‚Äôs hard for me to process all of these emotions. I hope, though, that I have effectively conveyed some of the things I am feeling. It has been a hard year.

If you‚Äôve read this far I really do appreciate it. I‚Äôve felt isolated recently and I needed to vent. I‚Äôve dealt with this stuff long enough to know that good times will come again. I hope those good times come soon, for all of us.",I'm dealing with a loss that is somewhat unique,1562122239.0

The guilt side of things stems from a suicide attempt last year. I took an OD and the doctors at the time told me I almost damaged my liver.

When these thoughts intrusively pop up, I cry. I cry because I'm scared of not existing, I'm scared of the hurt that would cause my family. I'm scared of being without my parents or my sister.

185,Anxiety,"So I‚Äôve had an official anxiety diagnosis for almost 4 years now, but I‚Äôve always shown clear signs of it, even when I was a small child. I also have ADHD, and I‚Äôm not sure if this thing I‚Äôm experiencing could be from anxiety, ADHD, or something entirely different. I was hoping some of you guys could help me out by letting me know if any of you have also experienced this. 

What I am experiencing is sorta like a panic attack in the sense that I can‚Äôt control when they happen, and they can brought on directly by stressful situations, like exams or ordering food in a restaurant. They can also be totally random, though. 

But instead of going into, well, panic, I just sorta freeze. My mind goes totally blank, and I mean TOTALLY blank. As in I don‚Äôt even have thoughts (or I can‚Äôt identify them, I suppose). I feel like I‚Äôm floating, and like I‚Äôm in a dream. Moving becomes incredibly difficult and although it is possible, the slightest movement requires a stupid amount of energy and willpower. Sometimes I can go without moving for hours. And I don‚Äôt blink regularly either and my eyes start watering like crazy from being open for too long... I can here and see people talking to me, but I can‚Äôt process their questions and I just end up staring blankly at them, and they freak out cause they think I‚Äôm having a stroke or something.

I need to sleep or I‚Äôm going to collapse!! I. Need. Sleep. NOW!!‚Äù.

I‚Äôve asked all my psychologists/therapists that I‚Äôve had over the years, and the best I‚Äôve gotten is that this is the ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù part of the fight/flight/freeze response, which makes sense, but I feel so alone because every time I talk to someone (not a professional) about it, they don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. And does this trance thing have a name?? Other than The-Freeze-Portion-Of-The-Fight-Flight-Or-Freeze-Response?

I to the ER after spending hours convinced that I suffered from a stroke or aneurysm, even though I suffered from no physical symptoms. After a clean bill of health, I'm discharged with a suggestion to take better care of myself. However, as I'm leaving, I notice that I'm feeling a bit off. I shrugged it off and assumed it was recourse from the attack or the IV/blood loss from the bloodwork, but I still feel the same a week later.

Essentially, I'm much more apathetic and a little bit numb, but also much more focused and aware than I had been before. I also noticed that my balance, dexterity, and tension headaches have decreased. I have full strength and no signs of a stroke, but I do have a loss of appetite and occasional lapses in focus.

193,Anxiety,"I have been lonely since after middleschool when we moved to a new town. I had great friends in middleschool and was very social. When we moved to a new town in my freshman year, everything went down hill. In my freshman year i got a terrible nickname and couldn't make any friends because of it and i started spending weekends alone and im in senior year now and nothing has gotten better. My nickname has disappeared though because everyone has forgotten about me and i became the quiet kid in school. My social skills has gone down and i cant even make friends outside my school or keep my old friends and now my mom is constantly telling me how disappointed she is because i cant find a date for prom and she also keeps telling me to get friends to hang out with during holidays as all i have to do with myself during these times is to play video games. 

Over time i have stopped caring and just accepting  that i am lonely and trying to have inner peace with myself but recently my loneliness has hit me harder than ever before. 

You know when you sit and imagine yourself in situations that you'll probably never be in and act it all out in your head.. We all do it. Now i have recently imagined myself with a beautiful girl i love a lot and how my family and everyone sees me being happy with her(yes i know it sounds cringy). She looked like queen margaery from GoT as i fell in love with her while re watching the show and couldn't stop thinking of her(ik its wierd). So while i sat playing games and imaging myself with such a girl i snapped back to reality and realized how little i actually have and how i may probably miss out on this experience of loving someone so much you'll do anything for them and spending time with that person and going places with her and laughing about stupid things.

I am scared that i will never experience this beautiful side of life and never meet someone like this. I also dont experience any love from my family. I might sound ungrateful as i have a mother and father that are still married and i feel extremely guilty for being so ungrateful but i just feel that we never actually speak to one another and i have absolutely no relationship with my dad and i just keep disappointing him and my mother because of my loneliness and tourettes symdrome that they get annoyed at.

I came here because I am hoping this will help me put my mind at ease as I am too weak to actually talk to anyone about it. I am not diagnosed with anxiety and am not trying to self-diagnose or anything but this just felt like the most fitting sub for this. 

For maybe a year and a half now I haven't been able to shake the feeling that all my friends hate me and anyone who I respect is disappointed in me (with the exception of family fortunately). I first noticed it when playing games with my oldest friend. We would play online practically every Saturday as we live pretty far away now but whenever he didn't want to play or would respond I would start stressing out and lose interest in doing anything else. this persisted for a while. The next time I noticed it got worse was with my theater tech group and robotics team. I have always worked pretty close with the theater tech director but I absolutely hate talking to him despite him being extremely nice. I can't help but feel like he's disappointed in my recent work and thinks I don't show up enough. When ever I would see him walking around campus I would always do my best to act like i didn't notice him for fear of confrontation. I think this is in part because i was trying to balance tech with robotics which i had similar but different feelings. I was supposed to be leadership but showed up less than half the time due to tech (this has all been past-tense because I have recently graduated). This is about when it started to be a constant worry.

Things started to get really bad once the second semester started. Due to a collision of friend groups I made a couple of new friends that I like to think have become some of my closest friends. up until I met them I have never spent time with any of my friends outside of school or school extracurriculars. with this new, larger friend group we would go get coffee after school and hang out for a bit. Having never done this before I was always eager to hang out all the while convinced that they hated me. Now the 'the boys' included more said 'boys' I have been worried that I do not spend enough time with each individual while somehow also thinking I am too eager to hang out and come across as needy (if I am being honest I absolutely fucking am but I do my best to roll it back, fortunately this is made easier by the fact that I'm a pushover and when people don't want to hang out I don't them about it). I have this constant feeling that they hate me and its always there, I can do things to distract myself but not entirely. I still feel it like a giant leeches are sucked on my back, its an absolute physical sensation and it makes me want to melt into the floor and destroys any interest in doing anything at all. 

This feeling has gotten so incredibly, much worse in the past couple of days. Now that we've all graduated we don't see each other every day but I don't think that bugs me very much. A couple of my friends are working at our (now old) high school by helping run a robotics program for middle school kids and some of us would show up just to hang out when their shift is up. Three days ago, on a Friday, my friend 'M' called us while we were there and rather eagerly wanted to plan sometimes to hang out before he leaves for Korea. we planned to do something this coming Sunday and something with just me, his sister, and some of his friends( that I don't know and aren't part of the main friend group) later this week because he wanted to show me this cool board game shop and play some games there. I agree and am excited to hang out with him again because we've both been traveling with family. The next day I text in the group chat trying to plan what we wanted to do on Sunday but replies are scattered and nothing concrete is made. I throw out the idea of playing D&amp;D and people are interested but some people cant make it. I was looking for 3 players because I hate DMing for just 2. Only two,'T' and 'W' could make it but we were still waiting on confirmation from M. Only replies from M were a couple of Thanos gifs leaving us with no solid plans. Sunday morning, Dawn of the Final Day, I try to plan something but still nothing from M other than maybe another Thanos gif. I start to get worried if M is okay and message him asking so and also absolutely convinced he hates me. T, W and I end up hanging out, getting coffee and going to a record store, the whole time I am so uncomfortable and stressed out. during this T reveals that M had messaged him privately but doesn't feel right sharing which I absolutely respect and I didn't push at all. I am now certain that either something is wrong and/or he hates me. I spent the rest of Sunday and all of Monday trying and failing to convince myself that he doesn't hate me and I haven't been able to do anything else. I try running some errands for my Mom but that did distract me at all. I messaged T asking if M is okay being clear I don't want to push  saying ""don't share if you feel it's not your place to but I'm starting to get concerned about M. Do you know if he's alright?"" and he replied with ""yeah he's fine."" which did ease my mind a bit, at least I know that he's not in any trouble but I am still convinced he hates me. I messaged M a couple of times today asking about other plans we made on Friday but still no reply.

I was supposed to play games with other friends but couldn't find the heat to, I tried to sleep but I'm still writing this at 1am, M still hasn't replied. I've been stalking his steam profile, he's invisible but his recent activity is going up so I know he's playing games. I feel disgusting, I want to disappear. I'm sitting here crying and desperately wanting to scream. I know these thoughts are irrational but that makes me hate myself more. I want to scream.

209,Anxiety,"Last summer was the worst months of anxiety. Last summer, I couldn‚Äôt stop anxiety and I kept checking and rechecking with my boyfriend. It was our 1st year anniversary and I was basically grilling him with questions for hours and he kinda just...snapped. Not angry, but his normally very patient self got very somber and just went: ‚ÄúI just wanted to have a nice anniversary‚Äù

Fast forward a year later, my anxiety is 10x better than what it was. I rarely get panic attacks, and when I do, they‚Äôre short.

Yesterday was our 2nd anniversary. BF want to have the day together to just chill. It‚Äôs an awesome, chill day, but we have to go to a rehearsal (I‚Äôm in a play, he‚Äôs doing lights). This irks him a bit because he really just wanted an ‚Äúus‚Äù day (I did too), but the ppl there are fun so his annoyance doesn‚Äôt last long. We decide that after, we will go home to cuddle some more to finish off the day on an intimate note. 

Anyway, my friend (who is also in the play) tells me her husband is away and is afraid of being by herself in the house. That gives HER anxiety (she also has BAD anxiety). She also can‚Äôt drive (due to anxiety as well). She asks me between scenes if she can sleep over at my house. I say sure because I know what panic feels like, and honestly, we are about to go on stage and I‚Äôm not even really thinking.

(A note: my bf and I live separately still; still living with parents to save money).

Fast forward to the end of rehearsal. I quickly tell my bf what‚Äôs going on (I honestly forgot I didn‚Äôt tell him; again it happened so quick). And I drop him off then take my friend to her place so she can get her stuff. We realize we can‚Äôt sleep over tonight (family stuff, long story) and so I drive back home. It‚Äôs too late at this point to go to his house (I‚Äôm exhausted) and again, I can‚Äôt sleep over with him tonight.

When I call my bf, he sounds not too happy. Just kinda short. I ask him what‚Äôs wrong, and he says he was looking forward to ending the day with just us, that it would have been different if I had talked to him about the change of plans first, but that it‚Äôs our anniversary and he feels abandoned. I at first get defensive, but then listen when he says he feels like his frustrations are sometimes fought against. 

So that right there started getting me anxious, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bad partner, oh no oh no oh no‚Äù

So I listen to his frustrations, then I kinda just say, ‚ÄúI feel like there‚Äôs a trend of bad anniversaries, last year was bad and this year was too‚Äù

And he says ‚Äúyeah last year was really bad. And this year...yeah it ended on a bad note‚Äù

228,Anxiety,"I have been having one of the worst weeks I've had in years.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started with quitting my first job. I used to work in a warehouse and it was fine, just boring. I'd gone almost two years without a write-up and nothing but praise as far as my work ethic and productivity. I was told I was one of the best on the team. This was probably the healthiest I'd ever felt mentally. I felt stable.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I transferred I was written up a couple of weeks in because I had made something like 2 errors in 1,000 items. I knew I had another write upcoming due to the insane productivity standards. I realized I was only one write up away from being fired. I already deal with anxiety and depression regularly and the thought of losing my job put it all into overdrive. It had me in tears and shaking every night before work for weeks. I  made myself sick just thinking of stepping foot back in that place. I spent all of my free time sleeping or feeling like human garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided enough was enough and I wasn't going to let them do this to me anymore.  I quit as soon as I had another job lined up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I came into the new retail job very enthusiastic and happy to be out of the warehouse. Though it quickly became apparent that it wasn't going to be the positive change I was hoping for. All the horrible feelings came back worse than ever because this new job somehow managed to be worse than the first.  I work hard, I come home bruised, cut, sore, and drenched in sweat from practically running from one side of the store to another to get things done. My hands have been painfully locking up on me and my arm hasn't been the same since my last job.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've received almost no training for this job and can't seem to get any help no matter how many times I ask. Everyone seems to avoid me. The people I can get to talk to me say that I'm doing fine and it just takes time. The manager made it clear he feels otherwise and I'm sure I'm on the fast track to being fired. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I've only had the job for 8 days and I've been talked to twice about my productivity. The expectations I'm given just seem so impossible to me right now but I still hate myself for not being able to reach them.  I can't talk to anyone about just how much pain this puts me in to not be able to do this job at 110%. The few people I can vent to tell me I need to just toughen up and that's just how life is.  I keep being told this is one of the easiest jobs out there and tell me there is no way I could be failing at it. I've also been told I would have to be completely inept to not be getting it. They won't genuinely listen to my concerns and always turn it into my fault and me being weak.  I'm starting to feel just so worthless about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sick to my stomach and I have never wanted to disappear more in my life. Just the anxiety of going in this coming week is eating me alive. The manager already told me he has a huge project he wants to put me on to test me, I've only done the task once with help on a very abnormal day. I've barely been trained for it and I feel like I'm being set up to fail. I know when that day comes he's going to be disappointed and more than likely angry that I can't get it done in time. I'm constantly being told to hurry up.  I'm doing everything I can to improve, I've read lots of advice, I've tried getting the manager's help, I just don't know what else to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

 The closer it gets to the end of my weekend the more I try to come up with something drastic to do just to get out of going back. I've been spending all my spare time either panicking about this job or sleeping to avoid thinking about it. The anxiety gets at me so bad there are days I can't even bring myself to eat or do much of anything. The manager tells me he understands I'm slow because I'm new but immediately starts hounding me about going faster after he says that. I feel humiliated and ashamed by all of this. I've been applying like mad to anything and everything for a chance to escape the hell that's coming this week but setting up interviews just takes so much time.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep telling myself its just a minimum wage job and there are plenty of others. If I get fired I may be able to get unemployment as well.  I have an online side hustle too, and I can use that to pay my bills if I have to. I keep trying to remind myself that I can only do my best and if that's not enough then there isn't much else I can do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

The only positive thing keeping me going right now is that I am on the third interview for an amazing company and it at least seems to be going well. I will be making double my current hourly rate if I can land it. and If all goes well I will have a way to escape this awful job. Though I can't help but feel it's pointless to get my hopes up and that I'm being delusional. There are lots of other candidates. I'm worried I'm coming off as desperate to the hiring manager because of my underlying situation. This really would be a dream job for me as it's in the field I got my degree in.. I'm trying to think positive.

I've been successful overcoming some of my phobia so far - I can go swimming if I start slow at the shallow end/beach, I went sailing (was petrified the whole time but I did it), and I've participated in a few dragon boat events. 

He suggested we join a canoe club so we can take the canoe out and practice with it. I joined, but here's the catch: we need to pass a short course to be able to borrow the canoes. This involves getting into the boat, tipping it, and recovering from tipping it within the allotted time frame with the instructor. Just thinking about this class and the trip is giving me anxiety.

I go out for a jog and pray I get hit by a car or break my limbs so I don't have to do any of this. I'm worried about what the instructor will say to me and I'm even more worried that I'll ruin this trip for everyone. To top it off, I legitimately feel guilty about my feelings on this.

I feel like i don't love him anymore. But i love him so much? So the fact that i don't love him makes me feel miserable, he's so nice. But sometimes i feel like he's less than nice, and i don't like the way he treats me. But am i asking for too much?

 Am i being unreasonable? I feel like I'm making boulders out of pebbles. I overthink everything, is my anxiety ruining us? Am i projecting my own problems onto him, because deep down i know he's just a good person. He has his flaws but that's normal. Why am i sad then? We go out and i feel almost bored or exasperated with how he acts? And i feel bad about feeling that way just because it feels presumptuous to want anything from him when I'm kind of a shitty person. 

I shouldn't make decisions when I'm emotional. Really when i read over this, am i questioning wether i really love him? Am i being selfish? Should i let him go if i feel this way, I'm wasting his time. But i don't want to, is it because i love him. I do like him, I'll always like him.

238,Anxiety,"So recently I've been under a looot of stress. 

When I'm stressed I also tend to get panicky and obsessive about my health.

I started getting some neck pain, and for a while I was convinced I had a swollen lymph node in my neck (the area felt kind of swollen, but mostly tight), and thus had cancer (obviously). I went to a doctor and he threw me a prescription for antibiotics to ""try"" without ever testing me or even asking me questions. I was like nooo thanks. Since then I've talked to several doctors who all have something different to say and have been completely unhelpful. But it's been obvious to all but the first doctor that I don't have an infection and antibiotics are not warranted (this doesn't stop me from being worried 24/7 that I might anyway).

Since then I've researched ENDLESSLY on what could be happening and I'm at the point now where I am convinced I actually have a muscle knot since I also have random pain in other parts of my upper back, and the knot seems like a trigger point. I looked up a diagram and it showed the location of where pain often occurs along with the trigger point and its exactly where mine is located. That coupled with the fact there aren't any lymph nodes where mine was, plus I could only feel the knot where the muscle is under my skin whereas lymph nodes swell and are visible above the skin. 

Obviously I'm not a doctor, so I cant be sure if this is the problem or not, but I've tried getting professional help and it's gotten me nowhere, so.

I'm curious to know if others with anxiety have experienced pain/tightness in their neck and shoulders, and how they deal with it. It's going on two weeks now and the pain comes and goes. It's better when I'm not at work, or when I'm out walking around. I've been depressed lately, so I haven't been getting out of the house much - I've noticed the pain can get worse if I'm sedentary. Also when I do sleep it's like I'm dead and I literally wont move all night, so sometimes I wake up with one hell of a kink in my neck, which hasn't been helping. It's concerning because I have been having issues breathing properly due to panic and I've noticed my arms feel heavy sometimes, and recently the veins on my chest and neck have become more noticeable - they always were visible on my chest, so it's not too weird. But I'm worried it all may be connected somehow.

247,Anxiety," 

hello, i'm throwing a SOS here as doctors in my country were not able to help me... has seen a bunch from several specialties (endocrinologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, immunologist etc) for 3/4 years without any amelioration, result or proper diagnostic.

i will try to make it as short as possible, let me know if other details are needed. 25 female, caucasian, europe, 1m60, 52 kg, currently no medication other than topical steroids for my eczema.sorry for the english.

I basically would like to know if what i am experiencing is ""normal"" and it's indeed something 'psychological', that i'm not the only case in this world.

Basically i've been through a quite rough period of my life a few years ago (a bit bullied, not comfortable at school etc), nothing that serious but i am a quite sensitive person. I developed some anxiety after it.

1. 3 years of my life, i stuggled to live and done everything with lots of effort. I basically forced myself and my body to keep up and be able to study etc. during those years my eczema was really awful (not sure if it was indeed atopic eczema or something else, but there was hives/itching and chronic flares up and scars).
2. 2 years of my life were in bed. going to the doctors to see if there's something wrong, blood tests positive, mri fine, sleep test fine. living with parents, being financially supported by them.

my main symptoms: you know the feeling you have when you have temperature (40 celsius degrees)? the feeling in the head? i had that (head feeling unwell). sometimes like someone had hit me on the head on different places. sometimes like there's something ""empty"" in my head or missing.feeling like someone had put a metal bar in my head. not migraines. feeling like i do not get enough oxygen. can describe more although it's difficult.

body weakness (not muscles weakness), as in no energy, feeling like i hadn't have sleep for ages (also i was sleeping more than i should), sleepy frequently, having long naps during the day.

superior members (arms etc) mainly feeling weak compared to the legs.

overall feeling very very unwell to the extent to not being able to do normal stuff (shower, etc). symptoms very physical NOT psychological (wasn't feeling sad or having dark thoughts). the head was the most awful thing. not migraines, not headaches. a bit hard to describe.

appetite quite normal.

have done stuff like traveling etc (accompanied with parents), nothing changed during the trip or so.

really awful feelings, daily basis, even when just laying in bed i was feeling them and suffering.

3. i am currently a bit better but really still unwell. i do 10-15% of what i used to do when i was ""normal"" (loved reading, wide cultural knowledge, high grades, practiced some sport etc). i wake up feeling awful and it lasts till the afternoon/evening. after that i am a bit better, slightly. head very very unwell, body unwell, forcing myself to do stuff and act normal. almost 24h/24 (those feelings).

I just wanted to have a discussion about products that have helped a little with your anxiety. I just want to make it clear that I don‚Äôt believe in quick fixes and for me personally, I take holistic approach to dealing with my anxiety (medication, CBT, physical activity, meditation, etc.)

Having said that I have found some products that have helped to relieve some symptoms for me, particularly in regards to sleep or at least make me feel more comfortable. These include:

* weighted blanket- I read about these online and half thought that maybe it was just a scam but I was curious and went ahead and purchased one anyway. I‚Äôve genuinely found it really comforting. I have issues with sleep and it helps to make me feel safe and slow down some of the thoughts in my head, making it a little easier to sleep.

* Aromatherapy diffuser- Again this is something that calms me down a little. I suppose it has something to do with being able to concentrate or even being distracted by the smell or maybe even an association with calmness.

He has 'mysophonia' (hope it is a good translation). It basically means that you can get annoyed with sounds really fast, and he mostly has it when eating. He hears my mom, dad, and me chewing, and he gets very annoyed by that. Because of that, he doesn't talk. Now, I try to talk during dinners because I feel guilty for not talking back when my mom tries so hard to start a conversation.

I am currently experiencing the worst, most crippling constant anxiety I have ever had. It started about a month ago when my friends dad passed unexpectedly. I'm not sure why this jolted me the way it did, but it did. I have been unable to eat, sleep, drink, or do any kind of work unless every single person in my family is at home. I'm constantly dreading each day because I know that with a new day, comes a new person getting up to leave for work. even if they are five minutes late home, I immediately catastrophize and start panicking. once, my mother was late home from work and I vomited from worry. I am incredibly emotionally drained and exhausted, and I just cannot wait for each day to end. I feel like this is no way to live, so I need to know if anyone out there has ever experienced anything similar. my worst fear, probably ever, is having a loved one go missing. this is why I am constantly messaging people to find out their location, and when they don't reply, I go into full blown panic mode. I am worried so often that I feel physically ill, and I have tried talking to my parents but they chalk it up to over reacting. I just cannot see any joy in anything anymore, because I'm so constantly worried about who will be home when.

However, it started going downhill even more a couple of years ago, and I believe that it's not actually a memory issue, but a memory recall issue caused by anxiety. At this point, most times when I have to think about something to put together a concept or even remember what I ate in the morning, I can feel my stomach drop and I start to panic, thinking ""what if I can't remember this? I should remember this. Oh god, by now I should have been able to answer this question \[to myself or to the person I'm having a conversation with\]. I'm looking stupid. I haven't even started to think about this, *why can't I think straight.*""  
Obviously, with my brain being blocked by all these anxious thoughts, I end up completely unable to even try and actually come up with an answer, increasing, therefore, the anxiety, and so on.   
When this problem started out, it only happened occasionally, but by now, I have it all the time. I find myself unable to do easy maths such as 7\*6 sometimes, simply because my brain freaks out about the possibility of me *not* knowing the answer. It also leads to me not being able to properly listen to people. Earlier, someone tried to explain a game to me, and all my brain did was scream ""what if you won't be able to understand this, they will think you're stupid"". Obviously, I didn't actually hear a single word of what they said.   


Does anyone know how to overcome this? My only ""trick"" so far is writing everything down and basically ""thinking"" on paper, but it takes an immense amount of time and obviously doesn't help in face-to-face conversations. I'm so tired of this, I just want it to stop. Any tip is appreciated. Thank you.

289,Anxiety,"Does anyone else find themselves feeding off other people's moods, and heightening your anxiety? As well as having anxiety, I'm also an empath. The majority of people can feel empathy and understand what other people are going through, but some of us are especially sensitive. I'm not trying to blow my own trumpet here or sound pretentious. I'm not unique - there are tons of people like me, so I wondered if anyone struggled to cope with this *and* their anxiety?

Being a highly sensitive, empathetic person is mostly a hindrance. It doesn't take a lot of effort for me to be affected by other people's emotions, so much so that they feel *real* to me. This has triggered panic attacks, which felt really silly because I had to keep reminding myself that *I wasn't actually part of the problem*, whatever it was.

One example was when a friend of mine was lost in an unfamiliar city, and they called me because they knew I was up so they could talk to someone. They were fine, just unnerved. I know how uncomfortable I feel in situations like that, and all night, I felt a heaviness in my chest. I felt a sense of anxiousness and unease because I knew that was how my friend felt, and I didn't calm down until I got a text from them to say they were safe in their hotel.

I have a friend with anxiety, but they aren't as badly affected by situations like this. Their anxiety stems from their own situations and their own feelings. This isn't a bad thing - it's personal to them. I'm just one of the many unfortunate people who aren't only impacted by my own anxiety, but other people's circumstances as well.

For some background, last year (sophomore year of college, 2018) I went to my nurse on campus and was diagnosed with severe anxiety. I started taking Zoloft, if I remember correctly, but stopped taking it due to:

1.) Side effects

2.) I told my mom everything - I‚Äôve always felt like a ‚Äúnervous child‚Äù and like a worrier - but this was the first time that I had actually been diagnosed. Some days are better than others as far as nervousness, worrying, etc. goes, but my mother told me that she didn‚Äôt think I have anxiety, and I that I shouldn‚Äôt take the prescribed medication (although I did anyway to see if it would help).

I‚Äôm beginning to feel like I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end. Any advice or other comments would be very much appreciated.

A few questions &amp; statements, I suppose:

- Some things that I feel that make me think I may have anxiety, but I‚Äôm not certain. Am I just overreacting? 
* When I get nervous, my stomach hurts, I feel nauseous, dry mouth, shaky hands, sweaty, upset stomach.
* I‚Äôm scared of answering a phone call or sending/checking an email, talking to people, making/initiating conversations, etc..
* I worry that my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù find me annoying or see me as a burden, or that the people I work with don‚Äôt really like me.
* I worry about the future.
* A few other phobias that keep me up at night.

- I‚Äôve had a rough day, so it may not be helping my head space. I‚Äôm considering going back to my on-campus doctor when school starts, but I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm just overreacting to my feelings, and that nothing is actually wrong.
* For those who have taken anxiety medicine and experienced multiple side effects, is this normal, or is this a sign that you shouldn‚Äôt be on medication?
* If I end up seeking and needing help, I worry about my mom. Yes, I‚Äôm an adult, but I‚Äôm not sure how or if I should bring it up to her if that‚Äôs the case. Any advice?

My boss said I have to be there tomorrow, she sent me a separate email saying we would have to talk about all my appointments (I've had dental work done recently), and then today my coworker forwarded me an email from the boss because she thought she just forgot to include me, but the email said to make sure we have coverage after 5pm (only 4 of us work till that time). We also recently hired 2 new people so I feel like the writing is on the wall. I'm depressed because I liked this job a lot a few months ago and this won't be the first time I've gotten fired for anxiety related attendance.

312,Anxiety,"This is nothing new for me but it doesn't make it any easier every time it happens. To make a long story short I go thru periods where I think my friends aren't really my friends. I'm anxious and paranoid that they talk behind my back and rather keep me at a distance. Whether they were only friendly to me out of pity and now are trying to distance themselves from me. 

I go over my every interaction with them and try to think at what point did I make them mad? Did I say something to offend them?  Why all of a sudden they make plans without me or read my messages and don't answer me back? I know I shouldn't be upset about them making plans without me, but it still hurts. Especially since we did eveything together.  What changed, what did I do wrong? 

I play ""detective"" I look into details (messages, message time stamps, talking to other mutual friend/neighbor) that just reinforces my idea they don't actually like me.

 I also have a suspicion that my friend 1 who has been more distant than the other (friend 2) has been trying to make plans with my neighbor without me, who is also my friend that I introduced to friend 1. My neighbor, who has known me for much longer than her, showed me her conversation she had with her today about asking to make plans with her. When my neighbor mentioned about me going too friend 1  said ""whatever, she will probably be cleaning"". Which I say occasionally to people when they ask what my plans are on the weekend. Not an excuse to get out of plans.

I don't know, I just feel kind of crappy about the whole thing.  I sort of hope it's all in my head , then at least my friends are still my friends and I'm not as shitty of a person as I thought.

i take adderall XR 15mg, intuniv 1mg, abilify 10mg, and anafranil 25mg.

I can't really increase my antidepressant further (and in general) without ruining the desirable effect I get from adderall and then it becomes a game of increasing one, and then the other, and so forth.

Abilify 20mg doesn't do anything different from 10 or 15mg for me. And increasing my intuniv would further wreck my sex drive.

I don't want to take my prescribed gabapentin right now because i suspect it causes adderall to also not work. Plus it only helps a tiny bit at 300mg otherwise it doesn't do anything else and just makes me loopy which i don't like. Although im looking forward to when i can try Lyrica as it literally just went generic today

I can't take propranolol because i take intuniv and my doc has previously said taking both at the same time would be dangerous for my blood pressure

I have also tried buspar, atarax, seroquel, risperdal, lamictal, various other antidepressants (prozac, luvox, paxil, zoloft, cymbalta, effexor, lexapro). pretty much what im on now is the result of five years of exhaustive psychiatry and trial/error for my condition.

my problem, in short, is that i still panic when i react to responsibility, expectations, anything that isn't completely slacking off. this is just my personality, on adderall, off adderall, still the same

Most especially in a social setting, like before we go hang out with friends, I‚Äôll have anxiety from the moment I wake up and realize I have to go do that. That puts a lot of stress on my bf.

I‚Äôve tried breathing techniques, analyzing and identifying the room, telling myself I‚Äôm okay and it‚Äôs just anxiety. At this point I feel like medication might be my best option, even though going to see someone for it makes me so nervous and anxious. I just want to live a productive, happy, healthy life and my anxiety is ruining that for me. 

Sorry there‚Äôs not really a question and it‚Äôs long. I just feel like I need to put all of this out into the world, even if it‚Äôs just reddit and nobody knows who I am! 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, leave some technique you use for your anxiety.

350,Anxiety,"Hey all, a little bit of a frustrated rant here.

I just recently spent some time with family (which I try to do very minimally usually), and it seems as though EVERY time we get together they talk about what a skittish kid I was and how scared I was of absolutely everything and anything. Another thing that always gets brought up is my fidgeting habits or my old eating habits (I never used to like my food to touch and would panic whenever it would). I don't usually mind this and never really thought much of it. But then I got to wondering, why in the hell did my family never think that there was anything wrong with me then??? I always thought my anxiety came on recently during University and after my dad passed away, but it seems as though it's always been a part of me and nobody thought to do anything about it. Nobody was looking for these signs or even concerned that I was always scared of nervous about SOMETHING. My family even has a history of mental health problems, my mom is taking medication for both depression and anxiety. My grandmother is on medication for depression and anxiety. My father took antidepressants. And yet here we are, 24 years later and I am STILL struggling and STILL get irrationally nervous or scared. I've grown up always thinking that this is just who I was and that's just the way that I am when it doesn't have to be and that's why this is hurting so much. I can be more than just my anxiety, I've just never been shown how. It's frustrating that as a child no one ever thought to intervene or even questioned it and instead just accepted that as who I was, when I could've been so much more.

I dunno if anyone else has ever had this experience, if you have I would love to hear from you. I'm feeling pretty angry at them all right now and would love some consolidation. Thanks for getting this far if you did &lt;3",Family and Anxiety,1561998408.0

1. Internal chest tremor - Sometimes, while sitting, there seems to be a mild chest tremor inside the chest that randomly starts up, causing a nervous feeling and the slight feeling of shortness of breath. Is it a mild anxiety attack?
2. Sensitive sternum - Sometimes when I take deep breaths, my sternum/center chest area feels sensitive to the cool air going in. Creates for a tingly, uncomfortable feeling. I just read about costochondritis today, so maybe that's it?
3. Sore left chest and left arm - I sometimes get this when driving. I recall reading other people getting this too. Since it happens during certain situations, like driving, I'm guessing it's just anxiety?
4. Chest congestion - It feels sort of like a stomachache, but in the chest instead. The muscles around the chest area feel tight and I keep wanting to stretch. Sometimes it feels like my rib cage/sternum is too small and I wanna stretch it out to get a better breath.
5. Empty chest - Sometimes my chest feels numb, like it's an empty space and nothing is there.

356,Anxiety,"So I am returning to school in September for computer programming. 

I have moderate amounts of savings that could last me months into the school year. That is actually the entire reason I've kept the job as long as I have. However, it has been having many negative effects on me and my mental/physical health.   


Some things I've noticed:  


\-Stress sweats

\-Tight chest

\-Really bad diarrhea poops almost daily (I looked it up and apparently this is caused by anxiety/stress? Sorry for the TMI)

\-I've gone from 160 pounds to 130 pounds and I think it's from stress and the poops

\-Generally has just made me less happy and enthusiastic about life

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially the people I work with are nice, amazing, caring. But the job itself and the understaffed nature of the store make it so stressful to work there. I could be covering cashier 3 times a shift, while also stocking shelves and dealing with customers/price checks/bringing in buggies. Sometimes it's just me in the entire grocery department and I have to handle frozen/dairy price checks too.  


Because there are only 2 months until school starts I am strongly considering quitting.   


Keep in mind I do want to work still and earn money during the school year, but it would probably be better to shoot for an on campus job or something a little less stressful than this one.  


I have many people telling me to face my ""anxiety"" which has never been formally diagnosed btw, but I feel as if this job is making things worse. I don't really have issues talking to others, I'm just a quiet person sometimes until I'm comfortable.

361,Anxiety,"I read something the other day that kind of struck home with me and has left me, I don‚Äôt know, shaken I guess. It‚Äôs definitely made me rethink a lot of things.

Obligatory tragic background story. (Also this is a throwaway account, I don't want to offend my family who know my real account) Since I was little I have not liked people to touch me. I can‚Äôt explain why I just always avoided it as best I could. I remember we used to have to shake hands with the Pastor and ushers as we were leaving church, and that was fine with me but there was this one older guy who would always want to hug me. I want to make clear that this was not a creepy thing, he hugged literally everyone, he was just a hugger. I didn‚Äôt get a creepy vibe from him or anything like that, in fact he was a really nice man. Anyway, I would literally get (what I now understand to be) a panic attack while waiting in line with my parents. I was like 8-9 years old then. My mom sort of acknowledged it, if I refused to hug someone she forced me to do it but jokingly explained to them that I ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt like hugs.‚Äô They still forced me to hug people that we knew though. I tried to explain this to my parents but all my mother heard was that I somehow didn‚Äôt love her specifically. It‚Äôs not like it came out of nowhere I had been trying to tell her my whole life. It‚Äôs worse when I am stressed or upset. She tried to pat me on the shoulder once when I was upset and I literally shrank away from her and like shivered and got more upset and she got offended. 

It seemed to finally click with her, and I‚Äôm not kidding when I say this, my mom hasn‚Äôt touched me in about five years. She will even mockingly say to me, ‚ÄòI would hug you but I know how much you hate that.‚Äô I know I hurt her by telling her that when I was younger but every once in awhile I wouldn‚Äôt mind a hug from her or something along those lines. I also don‚Äôt want to express this to her because I made such a big deal out of it before I don't want her to think I am lying. Also it hurts worse when I feel like I have to beg for affection because when I receive it then I can‚Äôt help but feel its disingenuous. 

It‚Äôs getting better, or else more along the lines that I can control it better. I get panic attacks if I am in a large crowd. For instance when we are at Disney and going into a theater for a show or something I wait and go in near the end and find a seat somewhere in the back without my family. I once had a panic attack in the line for Kali River Rapids and had to leave the line while my family stayed. 

The worst recently was when I was having a bad day at work already and a customer who I has helping kept putting his hand on my arm when he would ask a question and kept patting me on the back. I was nearly in tears when I was done helping him and had to go sit in my managers office and calm down. She asked me what was the matter and I said that I just didn‚Äôt like people touching me. My manager informed me that she had noticed that when I first started and she put her hand on my shoulder and I had tensed up immediately. She said she had made a point not to do that with me again because she understood, her son was the same way. 

Is this something that other people go through? How do you deal with it and your family and loved ones without hurting them? I just can‚Äôt seem to make people understand without making them upset with me. It‚Äôs so hard for me to show emotions so sometimes I just do my best not to show any. 

What I read the other day was along the lines of if your child doesn‚Äôt like to be touched and you force them to give hugs or endure other people invading their spaces they learn to associate touch with negative things. And how humans crave touch and what a horrific thing it must be for them to go through life craving something that they associate with negative feelings.

I wonder if that could be what happened to me and why it got worse. And then I wonder, could I have either PTSD or something else wrong with me. I can‚Äôt for the life of me remember names or faces. I have people who work for me and have for five or six years and will draw a blank when it comes to their names. I have two girls who look sort of alike, I can picture their faces but can‚Äôt consistently remember which face goes to which name without their name tags. Admittedly I don‚Äôt work with them often cause they are on the night crew. 

I also have very few memories from the time I was about 10-15 years old. Is that a thing, to selectively not remember things? Like if I try hard to remember something it‚Äôs like my mind bounces off of something and sort of glides over or is pushed over and I just go ‚Äòoh well‚Äô and move on. Which when I think about now is really disturbing. 

Whew, I know there is a lot to unpack here, sorry. I just want to know if these things are normal or if anyone else has experiences with this stuff.

I went to the gym in the morning and was dreading work and being there for 8 hours and just interacting with co-workers. It got to 11, and I was home and got changed into my work clothes, and then I walked to work at 11:50. I started having a panic attack and didn't know what to do. I tried to get a hold of my friends, but no one was answering. After my panic attack calmed down I went into work, said hello to two of my co-workers, then thought to myself, I can't do this. I walked into the backroom to drop my bag off, and I saw the back door... I thought for less than a second and left through the back door. I went around the corner and started to have another anxiety attack again; it was awful. I then got called by my boss, but I didn't answer and then she text me and fired me for walking out of work.

364,Anxiety," So today I had a session and it seemed to hit me more than I thought it would. For background I have huge social anxiety, suicidal ideations/attempts (last one in DEC 2018), depression, trust issues all of that good s-hit.

Anyway recently I went home for the weekend (live 5 hours away) and my T. asked if I felt any connection or sense of loss when I say bye to my friends and family. I responded saying I dont really feel anything when I leave, Im happy to go home and be done with the constant visiting (going home means I have 15 people to spend time with in roughly a 36 hour window so its exhausting). So she asked a few more questions and it kind of dawned on me I dont feel a connection really with my friends and family. I love them but I just keep them at a distance because I dont want feel close to them (that probably dosnt make sense sorry). So that was one part of the session, me not feeling a connection to really anyone ever because I just dont trust people and if they leave I dont want to feel hurt or a sense of loss or anything. So she asked me to do something ANYTHING spontaneous (for me). Basically she told me just leave the house once this week for something other than errands or work. She wants me to do something before our next sessions (Friday). She suggested doing something for July 4th but the problem is I have no one to enjoy the fireworks with and I know if I go to some park that is shooting them all Ill be focused on is the couples and families enjoying each others company. Itll just make me depressed.

Ive talked how I would like to paint but when I did my first painting (Bob Ross) it turned out horrible and I havent painted sense. So she wanted me to paint again and show her.

366,Anxiety,"Many here have asked me about my full recovery from Anxiety and how I overcame Panic Attacks. Like many of you, I was on forums like these and facebook about 7-8 years ago after being diagnosed with panic attacks and anxiety. And just like you, after reading many posts about people suffering for years and years, and being told repeatedly I couldn't be cured, I had lost hope.

For recovery, I tried it all. I went to every medical specialist I could think of to find a root cause (primary care, GI doctors, Neurologists, ENTs, Psychiatrists), I went to many therapists, and even did alternative therapy like acupuncture, yoga, meditation, herbs and supplements, food sensitivities...you name, I'm sure I've tried it‚Ä¶Anti-depressants, anti-anxiety meds, ashwaganda, CBD, GABA pills, I‚Äôve done it all.

I had found some relief, but unfortunately my anxiety was still there. And it was consuming my life. I would still feel like I was on the verge of another panic attack if I went outside my house, I still had physical sensations like palpitations, nausea, dizziness, stomach issues, and some really bizarre symptoms like feeling like my body was overheating. And it wouldn‚Äôt just be physical, I would even have exaggerated irrational thoughts that I couldn't get out of my head. No matter how many times doctors tried to assure me I was healthy, I would constantly think that because these feeling are so strong, I must have something terribly wrong with me.

I felt sorry for myself, I felt sorry for my family who I was irritated by my obsessiveness, and I felt sorry for others who had to see me suffer. This went on for a long time. I lost a lot of weight (45 pounds at my lowest), would never leave my house, and was constantly googling things trying to find the newest scientific research about curing anxiety.

Then, one day, I went to the ER (probably the sixth time) and got diagnosed with anxiety (again). I got sent home and on my way home I found some lpublished by some pioneers of anxiety treatment in the 60s. Pioneers include Claire Weekes, who inspired many others who suffered and fully recovered from Anxiety as well. These authors who wrote DARE and At Last a Life, and others. These ideas are revolutionary ideas about anxiety, which are still considered ahead of today's time.

This approach was different. It didn't focus on the cause of your anxiety or panic attacks. It was only focused on the solution. It did this without having to rely on medication or external tools and gave clear explanations about why you feel the way you do. These explanations focus on your nerves being sensitized. This is due from prolonged stress (right before your anxiety and during anxiety). Your nerves react to stress in an exaggerated way, which bring unusually intense feelings. These feelings include scary thoughts and physical sensations. This is combined with confusion. Confusion about why you feel the way you do. This confusion leads to fear, which leads to more anxiety. The approach was to accept the feelings without trying to figure out why your feeling the way you do. This allows your nerves time to heal. This had solid scientific bases and has been proven over and over to help people overcome panic attacks and anxiety permamently.

I followed this new approach, and after quite some time, I began to start feeling better. It wasn't overnight, and it was very VERY hard. It was very easy for me to go back to my old habits trying to figure things out. But unlike other cures, this approach was different. I felt better, slowly, but better. I kept this up for a long time. Overtime, I started seeing the light on the tunnel. I started going back to doing things I used to like. I began turning to my old self. Fast foward some time later, and I was back to my old self. Not only am I exactly the same as I was before, but better. This experience, it really taught me character. I can handle stress better now, I work harder, I‚Äôm happier. But most importantly, I‚Äôm free. I no longer worry about anxiety lurking in the shadows waiting to pop its head up. In fact, I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack in 7 years.

Now, this approach by itself wasn‚Äôt the only thing that helped me come out of anxiety and panic. Much of it was making constant mistakes and gaining my own insight. But this approach was essentially the foundation of my recovery.

Now I‚Äôm not naive to believe this works for everyone with Anxiety. Anxiety is so broad and has so many components, that painting this solution as a broad brush to everyone with anxiety is irresponsible. But many people are here because meds didn‚Äôt work for them, and therapy didn‚Äôt work either. Why not try a new approach?

It takes commitment, but the advantage is full recovery and freedom. You become your own therapist. You become your own cure.

Recently, I left my medical device engineering job to help other professionals struggling with panic attacks and anxiety. This problem is so common with so many people I felt that I had a responsibility to help others.

Listen to me. It‚Äôs not your fault that you are dealing with Anxiety and Panic Attacks. Often times, its because we have been convinced by society to find a quick fix or miracle cure where there isn‚Äôt one. When there isn‚Äôt one, we feel like we, ourselves, are to blame and that this it us forever.

One more thing, it‚Äôs important to realize that even knowing this knowledge itself is not going to lead to full recovery. You need someone who has been through recovery, who knows the what common roadblocks, and common mistakes are. Often times, we unknowingly self-sabotage our own recovery because of old habits of fear and worry. Having someone keep us accountable and making sure we don‚Äôt stray away from the approach is a big part of recovery.

Since I‚Äôve started helping professionals overcome Anxiety and Panic Attacks, I‚Äôve been working with people who have suffered for 20 or more years and hadn‚Äôt had any relief. Most often, only after working for just a few weeks, these individuals are making huge strides with this new approach and are on the road to full recovery. However, everyone is different, never forget.

I wish with all my heart you are able to overcome this and get some peace and freedom.

Thank you for reading. I hope my post inspires some hope and optimism in your recovery. Recognize that I read many of the posts on this forum and still felt like my anxiety and panic attacks were more severe‚Ä¶and yet, I was able to fully overcome them without any long term side effects.

A group like this can definitely help support each other :)",A new approach to recovering from Anxiety,1562032230.0
367,Anxiety,"So I‚Äôve been suffering from pretty bad anxiety for about 3 years now, it started from insecurity but a few months ago I accidentally smoked a THC vape pen that contained 90% THC and was Sativa which made my heart race and made me extremely anxious to the point I thought I was dying and had to go to the ER, they did an ECG and everything came out okay and it was just the withdrawal effects along with my own anxiety. Then i had a panic attack and then another bad panic attack. This made me have alot of health anxiety primarily focused on my heart. So i calmed down, started meditating, having a small workout everyday consisting of stretches and pushups and I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack since nor do i fear having one in the future but i fear this might have left me with health anxiety to the point where i google every dicomfort I feel, my chest discomfort has had an increase over these past few days. My symptoms are:

-unexpected chest discomfort, feeling like something is wrong with my heart

-hot rooms along with bright LED lights give me discomfort 

-Derealization

-Minor pain/discomfort in back of the head

-Increased heart rate when I stand up

-Can feel my heart beating when i sit/stand still

-Ear pressure/fullness from time to time

-Tinnitus (regular ringing in the ears) (experienced pulsatile Tinnitus last week for the 1st time)

-Heart rate increases when I walk

371,Anxiety,"I am terribly afraid of insects, spiders and bugs, especially ones that sting (or that might sting), fly and especially their buzzing noises.

It is currently the middle of the night and I am on vacation in a hot country. I come from a northern climate where I do not experience many of them. The last cupple of days I have had issues sleeping because of constantly listening for and being alert when suspecting isects in my proximity.

I have been very careful as to keep my room clean of them but when I hear a buzzing sound I can't ignore it and experience flight or fight like reactions. E.g scream (varying volume), run, jump / get up or (as right now) stay alert and try to hunt them down.

Often if a sound is similar to that of an buzzing insect, it also terrifies me. What if what I hear turns out to be in my own head... (which might be the case now I'm not sure). 

This fear and how it controls my actions is tiresome and I want to find a way to overcome it. I know it won't go away in a snap but I think I need some advice or resources. Where should I even start?

372,Anxiety,"A month ago, I (20 M) started what I'd consider to be my first proper job. It's an internship where I'm working full-time for 3 months until the next Uni year begins. It's been useful for me, because I have struggled to get jobs in the past. I was so anxious about getting involved in the workplace that I would feel sick even sending off my CV. I got lucky with this because I was one of the students recommended for the position by my course leader, meaning that I didn't have to provide my (non-existent) references. For years I have had low self-esteem because I felt like I couldn't handle a job. I saw this as an opportunity to help ease my anxiety as it's had a major affect on me for the last few years.

&amp;#x200B;

The job itself has been relatively easy compared to other job roles. Our intern group has been separated from the other employees, so about 70%-80% of the time it's just us working on projects on our own. The remainder of that time, our boss comes in. He usually answers emails for an hour or 2 while giving us vague advice about projects occasionally. He's the only new person I have really had to get used to, as I already knew the other interns (we get along really well).

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that I am in a very good situation here, but I do still have problems that I am struggling with.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever the boss is around, or anyone I'm not familiar with, I struggle to think and speak properly. Anxiety hits me, which makes things difficult as my role is largely based around generating ideas. My mind goes blank, which isn't great when my boss asks questions in an overly-complicated way. I feel like I am performing worse than I would at Uni, as I find it harder to get any meaningful work done correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to get better at thinking logically in those situations because I'll be starting to work with other people in a week or so. I've met them once before and it was completely awkward. I was asked questions occasionally, but I struggled to answer because nothing came to mind. I even replied in a horrible coherent trail off sentence to one of them, who I later found out was one of the founders to the successful agency that we're working with. It was in a loud, informal environment though, so hopefully it doesn't have a huge impact on me. It's awkward anyway because we are completely different people. They're more used to the city and fast-paced environments. I'm more of a shut-in, happy in my own company kind of person. The way they were talking about where I lived as well - I didn't really appreciate. It came off as if they were looking down on the area. But I guess I'll just have to put differences aside.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling a little more confident in myself over the last month. I'm usually really quiet around my boss, but I have given a presentation once on the main task we were given. I have made some effort to say more than just the basic ""hi"" or ""how was your weekend?"" comments. I find it really difficult though. It doesn't help that I sometimes have no idea if I'm doing enough work, or if it is good enough. We don't get a lot of feedback and when we do, it's usually convoluted due to all the ""business speak"" he uses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have improved in ways, though. My anxiety was so bad during the interview phase that every time I had to meet the boss, I couldn't sleep the night before. However, when I started the job, I have managed to get a semi-healthy amount of sleep most days. I'm getting better at finding myself jobs to do as well, as I struggled at the beginning. It's just sometimes I feel unhappy because I feel like I should be better than I am now, if that makes sense?

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I have just been feeling insecure about the whole experience, but at least it is an opportunity to improve.

But. My friend makes me feel bad about it.
As most teens we complain, after a test we say that we probably failed it.

When she says that she probably got a C/E and gets a A/B. It's no big deal. Awell, that's cool. When she says she suck at a subject and yet get a good grade it's good! Like, I'm happy for you!

But when the same happens to me. Idk why or how, but she makes me feel guilty. 
""Oh. I thought you 'sucked' at this subject""
""Oh wow we get it. You got a high score. Congrats""
""Didn't you say you would get an E on the test. Yeah suuuuure...""

Idk I just hate this. Bc my grades prove me that what I'm doing is not in vain, that I might be worth something. But when she says it like that... I just can't help but wish I failed the test and I always feel like I need some kind of excuse to prove myself innocent.. And I just end up hating myself even more.

Dark lighting, strobe lights, the worst environment for anxiety. While serving one of the tables I could see an ocular migraine starting. (Seeing lights in my vision) 
Usually, I would panic. Freak out. Thinking I was about to have a stroke or a seizure. But I have into my anxiety. I knew I have had this happen before to me and I didn‚Äôt die. So I told myself mentally, I wouldn‚Äôt die this time. I took a moment to myself in the bathroom and gave into it. I took ‚Äúujjayi breathes‚Äù which I had learned a few days prior.

409,Anxiety,"So I am dealing with something extremely scary. A couple of weeks ago, I thought for a good week that I am going blind. I since then went to 4 ophthalmologists that reassured me that my eyes are fine. Context: I stood up after a lash lift with a huge migraine and was seeing blurry for a good 15 mins. The panic I felt in the moment is beyond imagination. That same night, although I could see clearly I noticed that the fluorescent lights were SUPER bright. They still are at night. Since that moment, I convinced myself I was going blind. The stress was intense. I also started noticing some transparent floaters that would ""glow"" in front of bright lights. I even went to the ER because my vision just didn't ""feel the same"". They did a CT. Nothing. Now waiting for a neurologist.

But since that hellish week, I have been experiencing other symptoms. I look around me and it's like I feel dizzy. It's like I hear muffled but my hearing is fine. It's like I can see although I clearly can. I experience shortness of breath often and even at night, I can't fall asleep because of this. I don't feel hunger or fatigue or any emotions. I feel trapped and like a complete robot. I try to stay positive, eat healthily, tell myself that it will pass like the rest of my loved ones say. But my brain always comes back to the thought that there's something physically wrong with me. and altough I don't feel the anxiety, I bet it's eating me alive as we are speaking. Doctors telling me everything is fine is not reassuring. Am I experiencing derealization? I am suddenly so aware of my internal being and yet so far from everything in front of me.

I recently got insurance but it doesn't cover Planned Parenthood so I have to make an appointment with a doctor and go in and do that whole waste of time thing. First of all the doctor isn't even available to CALL me for 10 days. I'm fairly healthy and don't want an exam/pap smear/general check up/pregnancy test....etc. I asked about getting birth control without all that and was told it ""depends on the practitioner"" so it's not even necessary or required by law for safety it's just more people controlling women that I have to pay for? ?? I'm very stressed and nervous, I don't want the massive invasion of privacy. I want to get an implant so I can have safe sex. Obviously I will do everything to needed to make sure using birth control is safe but if someone poking around in my vagina was required to make sure I could use birth control it wouldn't be up the practitioner. I'm really worried I won't be able to get birth control without either paying tons of money at an out-of-network Planned Parenthood or risking using just condoms to avoid the humiliation of not having control over my own fucking body.

418,Anxiety,"I‚Äôve been a manager at a fortune 5 company for 3 years now. I started out right out of college at 22 and now I‚Äôm 25. When I first began working there I discovered that I had work place anxiety. I never experienced this in college or before. I doubted all of my decisions in the fear of being wrong, or simply not knowing what to do. This then lead to slower productivity, more anxiety, the cycle goes on. Despite it being present I always was able to somehow get out of it through good attitude, and just working through it. My jobs were primarily operations or operations support related. I always thrived on projects and it was a definite skill to my employers. Fast forward to this March. I got a promotion to a project manager role. On paper this job was my dream role. Not worried about the craziness of operations, focusing on projects 100% of the time, and having company wide impact. Within the first week, I immediately began to see red flags. I began getting overloaded with deadlines as I was still learning the ins and outs of the business. The schedule was a typical ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù M-F schedule, but everyone was working 6-7 days a week to stay afloat. I was used to working an operations schedule which was four days a week 10-11 hours a day. I know the long days sound rough but that extra day was great to rest. Ambitious as hell,  I wasn‚Äôt so worried about the workload I saw in front of me. I was confident, and happy about the new job. As I began doing this i really started to see the impact it was beginning to have in my life. I‚Äôd rush to work in the morning, come home late, and spend most of the weekend working or worrying about work.  I also started experiencing many extreme uphill battles with projects, as stuff was starting to get assigned to me that I had no interest in doing. My personal life was completely evaporated and consumed with work. This began to give me anxiety which of course made me less and less efficient. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I‚Äôve been unable to complete big deliverables because I have so much anxiety about them. They are then late or incomplete which throws me into crazy panic attacks. I‚Äôm 3 months in and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve ruined my reputation. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where Ive had to leave work at times because I was having such a bad panic attacks. It all came to a point last night. I had 2 meetings scheduled for today that were critical for the year. I couldn‚Äôt prepare for them over the weekend like I was supposed to due to anxiety. Late last night I had a panic attack so bad that I went to a walk in clinic for meds. I never in a million years would think I need medicine for anxiety. I am also out for the whole week using time to recover. They haven‚Äôt given me any trouble over it but it‚Äôs at a horrible time to be taking off. I‚Äôm in disbelief that it has come to this.

442,Anxiety,"Hey everyone. The past few months have been pretty rough and I would just like to get everything off my chest. So basically, I'm a 15 year old male who had his first panic attack 3 months ago, in April. What happened was that I was on spring break, and was just hanging out at home. At about 10 PM, I drank a few cups of coffee (I usually never drink coffee) because I was planning on staying up and watching movies, playing games. At the same time, I was also trying to dye my hair with this natural plant called henna (it gives a reddish color), which I had done many times before. In order to apply it, you have to mix the powder with water until it becomes mud-like, which you then apply to your hair. I stayed up until 4 AM thanks to the coffee, and the mixture on my head was getting pretty heavy so I hit the shower to wash it off. When I got out, I felt a little strange but I just brushed it off. The sun was starting to rise and I was feeling tired so I went to sleep. I woke up about an hour later feeling sick and my heartbeat felt strange, again I just tried to sleep again. A few hours pass and I wake up, I feel really strange. I start walking down the stairs when I suddenly feel unable to breathe. I was indeed breathing, but it felt like no air was getting in my lungs. I immediately start screaming and yelling which surprises my mother who quickly comes over. My hands feel cold and numb, I'm shaking like crazy. My heart is beating at the speed of light.  I go to lie down, I feel like I'm dying. I keep telling myself that this is it, this is the end. It feels like an eternity, when in reality it was probably just 10 minutes. My dad rushes me to a clinic, but on the way the symptoms subside. Once I get there, the panic attack has mostly passed except for the intense feeling of fear. A nurse did a few tests that I'm not sure of, they told me all my vitals were healthy. I believed they performed an ECG as well and nothing came up.

I was discharged soon after and got a blood test done. Everything came back normal except for ferritin, which was quite low. I was prescribed iron supplements and magnesium to calm down. In the weeks after, I would have episodes where I felt my heart beat faster and feel generally unwell. Some were so bad that I would end up crying to go the hospital, but in the end it would always pass. Now, wherever I go, I'm always worrying about having a heart attack or not being able to breathe. I'm scared sometimes to even leave the house.

One thing that has always persisted is a constant hunger for air, I'm constantly sighing and yawning trying to get a gulp of air and I feel a certain tightness in my chest. When I mentioned this to the doctor, he immediately dismissed it as anxiety. Right now , as I type this, I'm feeling this tightness and hunger for air. I'm tired of feeling like this all the time. Recently, I ve started to get pain in random spots in my chest and abdomen, and I'm sure it's also the anxiety.

Also, I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with a very fast heartbeat and completely covered in sweat.

I have no thoughts of anxiety prior to the discomfort. The only anxiety comes from the pain. Also, even if it relax or deep breathe, it stays until I sleep. In the mornings, I usually feel fine.

448,Anxiety,"Needed to get this off my chest. I'm a medical doctor who graduated recently and I've been contemplating on taking the boards. The very thought of doing electives/observerships/being interviewed is kind of nerve-wracking! 

I've generally been a decent student throughout med school, studious, decent scores, never cheated, got through viva-voces quite without any hiccups. But the only thing that has bothered me the most was speaking out in public!
I've always been thoroughly terrified to give speeches/presentations in med school (but somehow managed it), but no matter how many times I try to overcome my stage fright and the anxiety, it just doesn't happen! I have sleepless nights weeks before my actual class presentation thinking of how I will be performing and how the audience is going to react. It's petrifying when I go out on the stage and my hands start trembling and I mess up the words and my mind completely  blanks out sometimes. I feel like I know very little about the topic and assume that the mediator will eventually laugh at my presentation. I feel like I have very low self-esteem and confidence levels and I've been trying to battle it since school.

Now that I have completed medicine, this huge question mark stands ahead of me. I am sure I'll be okay with the patients and the interaction with them. I'm worried about how I'm going to communicate with my consultants/colleagues (and don't even get me started about the grand rounds where there is practically going to be a rapid fire round where I'll be bombarded with questions for which I may/may not know the answers and my mouth and mind both might stop functioning).

449,Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

I haven't posted here before, but I could use a little advice or just encouragement after something that happened to me last night.

My boyfriend and I went to bed around 10pm and at 11:30pm our building's fire alarm went off. It is SO loud, maybe one of the loudest alarms I have ever heard. I don't to extremely well with loud noises, especially if they are unexpected.

I woke up screaming (not shrieking or anything, more like a loud ""ahhh"") and my boyfriend wanted to calm me, so he kind of slid on top of me and said ""the fire alarm is going off, we need to get out of the building"" as I kept screaming. At the time, I actually didn't realize I was screaming, which is why I was so alarmed that my boyfriend jumped on top of me and told me what was going on - because, yeah if you hear the fire alarm go off, that is what you do. I told my boyfriend later I was confused why he reacted that way and he told me he was trying to calm me because I was screaming.

Anyway, he helped me get out of bed and put a robe on. In less than 30 seconds we were outside and away from the building. We figured since we couldn't see or smell any smoke or fire, it was probably just set off by someone burning food or something. We stood outside for 10-15 minutes, and were able to go back inside.

I had a lot of trouble falling asleep last night. I'm usually a good sleeper, unless I am feeling anxious, then my brain tends to either want me to deeply analyze something random (for example: listing everything we have in the fridge over and over) or repeating the same thoughts over and over. Today, I have been shaking all morning and feeling extremely uneasy.

As someone who has suffered from anxiety much of my life, I know it can often be illogical, but still I feel silly being so shaken up from a simple fire alarm. I think it was just the first 10 seconds of being awoken suddenly by the alarm, my own screaming reaction, and my boyfriend's reaction to my screaming. It was a very unexpectedly traumatic and I don't know what to do about it right at this moment.

Has anyone experienced something like this?

Also, I want to note that I do see a therapist and will speak to them about this at my next appointment.

I called to ask about the results and one of the nurses told me I had osteoarthritis in my left hand, which is my less dominant hand so I assumed it was in both cause that‚Äôs how arthritis works, it likes to be symmetrical in your body usually although since I write (everything i do involves my hands, painting, writing, art) i understood my right hand would be noticeably worse and maybe that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt mention it at first.

But sometimes I get anxiety out of nowhere and deep down, I know how illogical it is, and I hate it.... but I still have it.

For example, tonight my boyfriend went to a party. It was a sudden invite, and he didn‚Äôt invite me along. Whatever, right? I trust him totally and I know he loves me. Although I was a little disappointed (I‚Äôve never been to a party, or seen my boyfriend drunk, both of which I want to do), I understood he just needed time with his friends. 

But my anxiety... I‚Äôm freaking out worrying if he‚Äôs cheating, how‚Äôs he going to get home, is he okay... etc. Even THOUGH I KNOW HOW ILLOGICAL IT IS.

I hate it.

And then I tried to ask my friend if it was fair to be a little annoyed at him for disappearing without telling me his plans to get home... and she was like ‚Äújust let him be an adult.‚Äù

I just wanted to be understood... I haven‚Äôt texted him at all because deep down, I‚Äôm totally fine with the party, I know he‚Äôs not stupid and that everything will be fine. But right now my anxiety is through the roof.

482,Anxiety,"I‚Äôm currently off of university for the summer and moving back into a shared around the beginning of August. I‚Äôve managed to find a beautiful woman to call my girlfriend and a strong support network of friends over my tenure at university, but alas; with my first year over and the return of everyone home I find myself alone.

Now I‚Äôm not truly and physically alone and I know that, if anything I probably have more family than most here. Two grandparents, a Caribbean grandfather and a British grandmother. I live with my uncle and my mother. I‚Äôm not to up on how trigger warnings work as I‚Äôve basically shut down my understanding of anxiety over the past year. But yeah, possibly major trigger warning. I‚Äôm sorry, it just helps to bear my soul to at least someone.

So around my birth, my father cheated on my mother and this caused her post maternal depression to go into overdrive. My dads a bit of a c*** and I mean that in every sense of the word. He‚Äôs a womaniser, always but his girlfriends first and let one of them slap me at age 2. He fought my mum while she was pregnant. Anyway, I started seeing him twice a week when that broke down and my mother retreated into herself (naturally, I don‚Äôt hate her for this although I do believe it feeds into my issues). Began to be raised by nan. Who was also depressed because her father, my great grandfather died around my birth. I was raised in a cold household with a lot of people who were emotionally closed off and never really got over their issues.

I was also born with two deformities, a large skin tag just next to my ear and hypospdias, which I really don‚Äôt want to explain right now but you‚Äôll be able to find it easily enough. So I feel like I may have had the world against me. Oh, and we were and still are super poor. Last year my first relationship broke down and my then long distance girlfriend left me for someone who had physically abused her in the past. She also had to juggle adopting her sister and niece and dropping out of college. Bullied relentlessly blah blah you guys have been there.

I got on an up when I got to university. I had my first kiss, lost my virginity, moved to halls and loved it and got an amazing girlfriend. Got very drunk, smoked a lot. You know the deal. I didn‚Äôt want to leave it behind. Struggles from a child only just began to make sense. I finally realised why I felt the way I did. Until my cousin on my dads side phoned me at 1am while I was at my girlfriends house with her parents telling me how my half sibling are 8 and 4 (I‚Äôm 18) and that I should reconnect with my father, because his mother (my auntie in law) had died, his step father abandoned him and he moved in with his dad, my uncle and my dads brother who had previously threatened to rape and kill his own son and his ex wife. 

Pretty much since then I feel like my mental health has tanked. I think my girlfriend is cheating on me constantly when I know she isn‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt trust anyone, I don‚Äôt know how to cope with being alone anymore and I‚Äôve cried for hours on end everyday for 6 of them now. And I still have a month left until I‚Äôm in my shared house with girlfriend and friends. 

Coming to terms with this stuff alone has been tough. Real tough. Thus, I come to you internet. I‚Äôm not sure if these types of posts gain much traction but I‚Äôd appreciate a friend or even a conversation at this point as everyone around me is just as traumatised as I am (low income areas and all that) and can‚Äôt really communicate their feelings well.

On mobile so sorry for editing or whatever

BUT let‚Äôs backtrack a little. A few weeks ago I started Adderall XR slow release to help with my racing thoughts. Before I was on 15mg then upped it to 20mg. Keep in mind, I am a 5‚Äô8 skinny white dude. I was spacing the medicine out every other day but two weeks ago I decided to take it back to back. Ever sense then, I‚Äôve had crippling anxiety attacks. Making stuff up that isn‚Äôt even there, having to leave work early due to just not being there mentally and so on (Side note: I talked to my doctor about lowering the dosage and all. But to be honest, scares the shit out of me to even touch it) 

My girlfriend, we‚Äôll call her Amelia. Amelia and I have been dating for about a month and a half and everything is going swimmingly well. But once these anxiety attacks started happening I started creating these nonexistent issues that weren‚Äôt even there. I started obsessing over things that didn‚Äôt need to be obsessed over. Amelia went to hang out with her coworker, we‚Äôll call him George. George was showing Amelia a good time with his friends. Which is fine don‚Äôt get me wrong, but my mind took it to a place where it didn‚Äôt need to. Drove me nuts. Blew her phone up because I just needed to know what was happening. We talked it out and everything is cool now but ever sense that first really bad anxiety attack, they keep happening. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs side effects from the medication or me coming down from it or a combination of both or I‚Äôm just crazy. Typically driving at night helps and listening to music. I‚Äôll call Amelia and we‚Äôll talk it out but I just feel like I‚Äôm burdening her and I don‚Äôt want to do that. I‚Äôve had anxiety before but NEVER this bad. These typically happen at night but sometimes during the day and it‚Äôs really random stuff that sets it off. I‚Äôm usually the ‚Äúhappy-go-lucky‚Äù guy but underneath the surface I can be a real hot mess.

I‚Äôve struggled with severe anxiety all my life and have been in counseling for it somewhere around ~10 years now - it‚Äôs better now, but I still get really bad social anxiety when shopping (I‚Äôm often checked/followed by loss prevention and security since I‚Äôm visibly anxious).

With that over with, let‚Äôs begin the story:

I‚Äôve been cooped up in my house all week and decided to head to the local mall to get out for a bit. My morning was already pretty filled with anxiety (got woken up by being yelled at, fun...), so I was already kinda shaky and on edge. I get to the mall, I walk around, I sit at a coffee shop and check my phone. I search through my texts with my ex-girlfriend/close friend and realized that the other night, we were talking about sex toys at 3am. She struggles with anxiety on par with mine, so neither of us had bought any in person or even ordered online.

Something just came (hah, *came*, get it?) over me and made me wanna take that anxiety head on and show it to myself that not only can I go shopping and survive checking out and people trying to assist me, I can buy the most embarrassing thing I want - a little pocket vibrator from Spencer‚Äôs - and be just fine. With that, I set out on a mission.

After a failed attempt (I ended up buying a pride bumper magnet - not complaining), I came back to the store, grabbed the pocket vibrator and plopped it down on the counter. The cashier couldn‚Äôt care less, I survived, and I walked out with a vibrator!

I have all the lovely side effects, but the worst of all was that it's made my anxiety and panic feelings a lot worse, like I have a constant almost unyeilding nervous energy 22/5 which is far worse at night. It's very frustrating, not only because from what I read, Busperione usually has the least bad side effects (I'm unlucky and getting some of the more uncommon ones, like gastral upset, brain zaps, muscle spasms, confusion etc) but to have anxiety increase into a barely staved off panic attacks at least once a day really freaking sucks. I'm also working on a lot of exposure therapy and CBT and that's definitely poked a already very mad very scared bear.I read that this can happen and for many it was like a switch at some point in the month to six week mark that their anxiety when markedly down and they were doing much better.

When the bar gets busy I have a meltdown. 3 times now I have had a panic attack in work because of how busy the bar gets.

 I should state that I've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks for about 10 years, but that I've been feeling really good and panic free for about 6 months, so what's happening in work at the moment is not new but unusual for present day me.

The first time the bar got busy and I panicked I was able to cry in the bathroom for a short while and pull myself together just enough to get through the last hour of my shift.

The second time it happened about 3 hours before I was meant to leave and I couldn't control it and I couldn't breathe and I had to go home. I felt so utterly useless and so stupid for stressing so much over making a few drinks.

The third time was 2 days ago. I had to leave the bar like 4 times because I was having a full blown panic attack. I stood outside for about 20 minutes at one point, just hyperventilating and dry heaving. The restaurant managers now know I have anxiety but my bar manager does not, and with how busy the venue gets I really cannot ask them to accomadate me.

This may be something I would get over after working here for a while but my panic attacks have just gotten worse every time it gets busy and I keep having nightmares now about work. I don't want to wait for it to possibly get better because currently I'm miserable.

I haven't stopped crying pretty much all day. I don't know when I'm next in work because they haven't sent me the fucking rota yet, I could be in tomorrow. I'm terrified and I feel sick and everything in me is screaming to not go back there.

527,Anxiety,"Hi all

I've been here for some time. Anxiety has been a passenger in my life since I can remember, but was only diagnosed at 30. A handful of years later, and two medications prescribed, I'm finally in a decent place.

Now, I still have anxiety issues, but the tie in since I was a child was overeating. Someone doesn't love me? Overeat. Friend thinks I'm too hyper? Eat more cake.

Generally every year, I gain some weight. I have never been on a downward trajectory. Add in getting married, buying a home, becoming a guardian to a teen, said teen leaving, and my husband leaving me without a care in the world, and to put it lightly I was plummeting.

Mainly because the ice cream never leaves me. Food is a comforting friend. I can get more. I am fortunate to live in a city where there are so many places to eat. My anxiety was (and still is) fueled by my knowledge of the easy and delicious relief only a short drive away.

But one month ago, I made one small choice. I've been trying to employ this mindset as of late that any progress is progress. And as I'm sure all of you can relate, you always wonder if it'll ever be enough. If you'll ever get to a place of calm. But I forced myself to take small steps. Even if it felt like torture.

And I mean small steps. I will bring one pencil upstairs with me, while I'm already on the journey, if I know it has to be put away in that area. One freaking pencil. Or one shirt. Nothing changes overnight but it does help some anxiety.

So one month ago. I decided to have a smoothie. Now, I am insanely weirded out by certain textures. One of them being seeds in fruit. For this reason, a lot of fruit is off limits for me. But I saw a mango pineapple smoothie that I felt I could enjoy. So I took a chance and got it with a work group.

I loved it. That night, I went to Trader Joe's having no idea what I was doing, and bought frozen pineapple and mango and juice. I made a smoothie the next day for breakfast. And the next.

I am now a month in, and I have NOT dropped 50lbs, (I wish, lol) but I feel so much better. My nails are long and healthy, I literally don't need coffee. I drink it once a week. And my menstrual cycles are significantly less painful.

Sure, there are plenty of times I eat like shit still, but every morning I have my damn smoothie. I do not have the same cravings. I do not have the same appetite. It's almost scary how much I have changed my body.

Today, I decided to treat myself and go to my favorite Chinese buffet. I had one plate. One cup of water. And the food did not taste like it used to. While I am a bit nostalgic for the rush of happiness that would come with a big plate of carbs, it was such an eye-opening moment for me, I had to take out my phone and write it all down.

So, here I am. Writing from a Chinese buffet. Only having had one plate of food. I don't want any more. I currently have no desire to overeat. And this has followed me and my anxiety for decades, and as cheesy at it sounds all stems from doing one little thing. 

Having something stable, in my case these damn smoothies, has changed me (and I'm pretty sure my gut biome) for the better. And it wasn't a big declaration. They were all small decisions. 

I love you all, and I no matter where you are in your struggle, or what it looks like - remember it is never too late. Try one thing. It's going to be tiny.

For the past few years, my anxiety has been difficult on me. Ever since I moved from my small hometown to a capital city for a new job, I have never expected that my anxiety level would get so severe. After working at that job for 9 months, I tapped out and resigned. 

Every work day is the same feeling; the moment I reached the parking lot of the office, I felt so difficult just to get out of the car to get my ass into the office. My heart would start beating like crazy and my palms and feet would get all sweaty. I has definitely affected my work performance and tbh, my boss was not pleased. I just couldn't keep myself grounded during my time there.

I figured I could take some time off before getting a new job, but I still get so anxious even though I just stayed at home all day.

Every noise I hear I think it is someone breaking in and coming to attack me, which I know is irrational and yet it feels like a valid concern because it TECHNICALLY is possible.

I watch like four movies per year, read small amount of books, because of anxiety I spend lots of time making memes and low-effort creation (luckily, this is slowly changing and I'm working hard on those habits). Same goes with music, when only one out of 20 songs I listen I like and then I'm repeating it for one month.

I've always dreamt about going to fine arts studies; graphic design degree. I'm from small city and, being sure about my potential and fully prepared, I applied to two colleges in largest cities of my 32-million country - one being very prestige, second ""backup"" way easier to get into.

In my country daytime studying is **free,** which is extremely important because money/student loan problem does not exist in this story.

My country has got conservative fine arts traditions. To apply, you must pass the drawing exam which turns into complete random lottery when other 169 people try to get into your degree too. As you can guess, I didn't, while all my friends from art high school did. I was doomed and applied to applied linguistics instead, hoping for some solid learning, getting new languages, cool people etc. With my french maturity exam on 75% I placed last on list.

Those studies hit me very hard. Adding to my ongoing anxiety, I got literally depressed for first time of my life, hardly able to learn anything. You can see it by advancement of this post - I've probably made lots of grammar mistakes despite ""learning"" this english all year. My ""last hope"" grammar exam got marked as 50% and I must wait 'til September to try again. Most of time I just played fortnite, cried about being unusable. Even walking across my cursed campus was pain to legs, I got very tired from every simple task... I had spent lots of time trying to learn anything in library. And icing on the cake - people here were veeeery different than people in my art school. Absolutely different mindset made it impossible to talk with them. I ended up being almost alone, not single party for whole fucking year.

Jump to now, exam time. Slowly digging out of all the trash, passing exam after exam, writing e-mails to professors to ask them about later exam date. Using free psychic and therapist help. At this moment I just want to finish freshman year using my ""disabled because of depression"" cheat-code from GP and get the fuck outta there.

New year, new possibilities. I applied for graphic design again. Geared with packed, large portfolio drove to city of my dreams, capital of my country which lays only two hours from my hometown.

I got denied with laughable rating - 8 out of 30 possible points. Again.

And here comes the clou and main problem - I just can't accept any half-measures. I want to apply to this fucking certain degree and I just feel that I will got depressed again. Nothing can satisfy me - my language studies, cheap alternatives to art studies, studying something easy also.

Adding more, I'm constantly analyzing my life and comparing it to my dreams. I'm sad that I can't got any friends on current highschool; I feel like I waste my younghood. I had very precise picture of my ""student life"" and currently I feel like I'll never fullfill it. This may come from fact that ""playing with peers"" phase (8-13 year old) was unexistent in my life, because of my weird lifestyle and overprotective parents (they are OK now, they were overprotecting me only in plain school).

Maybe because of this I have this resentment to had perfect social life, full with going to clubs, hanging out on beautiful streets of my capital city, drinking alcohol on beaches and dancing around campfires??? I want to get paid for this dead phase on my life, get my childhood wasted in Minecraft and not having any normal friends back???

**Ending this wall of text, I have question - how to deal with this ""never satysfied with anything"" feeling. How to accept fact that I'm probably not going to my dream studies and not treat this as life waste? How to stop connecting studies with social life and choosing degrees which (in my mind) will guarantee me social life I've never had?**

Being an irregular student does take a toll on you. Thoughts about being delayed made me feel embarrassed and ashamed.

When I enrolled on my last year, I had friends and relatives tell me they were excited that I was finally graduating. That expectation crippled me for a good portion of the year.

It wasn't because my family and friends weren't supportive - they were, they cheered me on. It was I that held me back. And I am glad I overcame my anxiety.

546,Anxiety,"I've had generalized anxiety disorder as long as I can remember, but wasn't diagnosed until I was in high school when I started feeling detached, and as if life wasn't real. I knew at this point I had to start therapy and figure out what was going on. Did cognitive behavioral therapy and group therapy for a solid 3 or so days a week for a summer. It helped, but I never really understood where exactly the anxiety was starting from. I couldn't place where or why it was happening. I wanted to go on SSRIs, but it wasn't really an option as my parents would not approve of it and I felt as if they underestimated how badly I felt sometimes. It wasn't until recently that I realized I only feel this anxiety when I'm bored. I know it's not going after the main origin of my issue, but I started realizing that my life could improve if I harnessed my issue with boredom and turned it into being productive all the time. I got a job, started college full time, started working out nearly every day, started eating less processed food, snowboard anytime I get the chance even playing video games or reading. I understand this might not be healthy, but my life has drastically improved, I have far less anxiety than I used to, and I've become a lot more fulfilled and happy. Not saying it's completely gone, I still get the occasional panicky feeling, but never full blown attacks. I'm not saying everyone should try this and I understand anxiety can worsen for some people by doing this, but for people like me that are used to being bored, start doing stuff even if it seems pointless like playing video games as it can interrupt that circular thinking  and even train your mind to stop thinking in a certain way.

For the last 10-12 months, I have been on a combination of Celexa and Wellbutrin. It has worked great for overall feelings, but I still have my isolated moments.

Now to what happened today. I work for a small aviation company and I am literally the only employee. We have contracted flight instructors but no other personnel. I sent out an instructor in one of the airplanes that we lease today. The problem is that the owner didn‚Äôt want that guy flying his plane. He told me this in passing months ago, but I slipped up and let the instructor take a 16 year old kid up for his birthday, which is about a 30 minute flight. Of course, it was a paid for by the customer. 

The owner called me fuming and cussing, which automatically sent me into a panic mode. He told me if it happened again, that he would remove the airplane from our company. He called me a few minutes later after stewing on it, this time even more pissed, and told me he was done and pulling the plane away from our business.

I was polite and apologized. The conversation ended, except it didn‚Äôt. Me being the type of person that CANNOT handle confrontation, I text him TWICE, apologizing. I immediately call one of my bosses (I have two, they are the owners of the company) and let him know what happened. He called his business partner, who had already been contacted by the disgruntled client, to try and form a game plan. They aren‚Äôt around a lot and weren‚Äôt aware the owner was picky, one even acted shocked.

I realize I shouldn‚Äôt have scheduled the instructor to fly that plane, but I honestly slipped up and forgot. Up until today, the last 6 months or so with this aircraft owner have been smooth sailing, and the owner admitted that. He has a reputation around the airport for being unpleasant.

558,Anxiety,"Hey guys, so I‚Äôve been searching online for other‚Äôs who‚Äôve experienced the same thing as me. I haven‚Äôt had any success so I decided I‚Äôd make a post about it and see if anyone else suffers from this too.

I will put a TL;DR at the end of this post if you just wanna get to talking.

I‚Äôve suffered with Anxiety and severe depression my entirely life, however, after having a panic attack on an insane amount of MDMA + whatever else was in those pills one night, I‚Äôve since developed a crippling panic disorder, chronic depersonalization and substance anxiety.

Substance Anxiety: 

The way I describe substance anxiety is simple, it‚Äôs the worry and fear of something (caffeine, sugar, gluten, drugs, medications, melatonin pills, tylenol, cough medicine, nyquil etc.) changing my mental state or consciousness. 

After suffering a traumatic experience on drugs (once on ACID + WEED and once on MDMA + whatever else was in those two pills), I‚Äôve developed ‚ÄúSubstance Anxiety‚Äù. It‚Äôs gotten so bad that I would get panic attacks not only from trying to drink coffee, tea or hot chocolate, but also from eating too much sugar, gluten, or anything I‚Äôd consider to have possible mind altering effects (completely irrational fears). This crippling fear has also lead to the fear of ingesting any medications, such as tylenol, nyquil and even melatonin. 

This fear is simply, ‚Äúwaiting for it to ‚Äúhit‚Äù. Waiting for the substance to take effect and essentially take control over your brain. 

I‚Äôve since been put on Zoloft 50mg, and have been on this for 4 months. Needless to say the first month was torturous as I had to overcome my fear of taking a pill and knowing full well it would alter my mind. Currently, this fear has it‚Äôs grips on me in a different way, as I feel completely numbed out and brain dead on this medication, so now I‚Äôm living in the fear of having your mind altered. I wish to come off the medication due to the side effects, but again, my substance anxiety is taking control as cessation of the medication (I have talked to my doctor and plan to taper slowly) will illicit the fear of my mind suffering alterations, once again. 

I am doing better with substance anxiety in terms of letting it spiral into complete panic, I‚Äôve been fine taking Zoloft every day, drinking decaf coffee sometimes, taking tylenol and even having a few beers.

So, if there‚Äôs anyone else going through ‚ÄúSubstance Anxiety‚Äù, past substance abuse or anything related to anxiety of something altering your state of mind, feel free to discuss that here. 

What are you triggers? What substance terrifies you? Caffeine? Chocolate? Sugar? A specific food? Even smells (the smell of weed or tobacco causing the fear of a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù)? 

TL;DR: Looking for a discussion and a place to talk about substance anxiety: The fear of something (caffeine, sugar, food, medications, smells) altering your state of mind and/or control of your mind. The fear you get when ingesting something and ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù for it‚Äôs ‚Äúeffects‚Äù to kick in. Discussion about past drug use is welcome, experiences with this fear, discussion about typical triggers, and tips and tricks to overcome this fear.","Substance Anxiety (the fear of something changing your mental state), waiting for it to ‚Äúhit‚Äù",1561910133.0

Some therapists insisted on diagnoses and treatment avenues that later turned out to not be helpful at all and only made me feel worse.

My psychological situation isn't a simple one, and I feel anxiety about talking about all of my various issues and symptoms because I might be laughed at, ignored, or perceived to be dangerous to myself or others...

 I did well in school but I constantly second-guess my degree choice even though I should be able to find work with it pretty much anywhere, and the idea of a job interview is 1000x more stressful than I ever remember the ones I did for my college jobs.

576,Anxiety,"I'm 34 (m), I have the recurrent obsessive fear that I'm losing my mind.  Best case scenario is my anxiety is skyrocketing, worst case scenario is that I have a form of literal dementia (originally spelled it as 'dimension') like Alzheimer's.

I was a heavy weed smoker for over a decade which led to definite and obvious declines in my memory.  I quit four months ago to see if I could reverse my memory loss and I was largely successful in that as my short term memory has vastly improved.  But other things have gotten a lot worse.  After about three months of thinking I've developed COPD (I got over that, luckily, no COPD) but certain quirks in the way I function are making me very scared of Alzheimer's.

Here's the list:

Word switching: will mean to say wallet and will say pocket.  Will mean to say living room, but say dining room.

Mispronouncing words: (especially switching the first letter of one word I intend to say with the letter of another I intend to say, IE spoonerism.)

Misspelling words: I'll just find my self completely focused on typing and lose track of how something is spelled.  I found myself trying to spell ""select"" as solect because I was pronouncing in my head with an 'o'.  As soon as I saw it I knew it was wrong, but I can see this misfiring happen all the time now.  I used to be really good at stuff like that.  Now, half the time I want to type 'knew' I type 'new'.  I'm messing up tenses more and my grammar seems to be taking a big hit as well...

Pressure in the back / upper part of my head.  It's never painful, the pressure is actually relatively mild, but its there practically all the time now.

Perceived change in how I read.  I'm constantly tripping up over words while I'm reading, like my head is filling in what the word should be before I give myself time to comprehend what's actually being written and it trips me up all the time.

I used to feel so eloquent, and I fancied myself a rather good communicator and now it feels like I'm majorly regressing.  I've been stressed before, and I've been depressed before, but this level of perceived cognitive decline is something I've never experienced.  I'm used to the feeling of not remember(ing &lt;- forgot to put an ing on the end of 'remember') what I was just saying, from when I was smoking so much weed, and I don't have that anymore, but I'm worried something is very wrong with me, and I feel like every time I experience any slight cognitive lapse, it triggers a very large amount of anxiety and thoughts that I may be developing Alzheimer's or some other form of progressive dementia.

I've read that people sometimes start experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer's in their 30's and I worry that's what's happening to me.  I honestly don't know whether to think I'm making myself go crazy, or whether I need to get an appointment with a neurologist.  I hate what this is doing to my wife, and I'm so scared of what my having dementia would entail for her and myself.

I honestly don't know if I want you guys to tell me I'm crazy or not.  But I'm in such a state of desperation, and I feel like it's all down hill for me for the rest of my life, and I'm scared out of my mind.",Preoccupied That I Might have Dementia.,1561925604.0

A few months ago this girl approached me out of nowhere and suggested that we hang out. we started  to hang out and spent a lot of time together. We started to grow closer and over the next week or so, she opened up about her (often moderate to severe) anxiety and her diagnosed OCD. As we spent time together and talked to each other, I began to develop romantic feelings for her and by the way she has acted/talked I think they were mutual, at somewhat. I am a college student and moved back home a couple of weeks after we met for summer break. She began to call every day and we often talked for hours about random things, but when she was has having a panic attack and her obsessive thoughts began to happen I was there to support her and reassure her. She apologized often and I reassured her that I didn't mind listening at all and that I was there for her. She mentioned that she felt that this was more than just a purely platonic friendship, but that she wanted to take things slowly and I assured her that I was fine with that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, a few weeks ago I drove down to where she lives and we spent the day together. We were having a great time and I felt like we were continuing to get closer. However, about an hour before I left she began to have a panic attack and alot of it revolved around relationships and how she felt confused and non-committal. We had talked about these things before and I had encouraged her to take her time, however, this time I acted hurt and took things personally even though I know they weren't meant that way. She ended up asking for space to ""save me some pain"" and over the past few weeks I have tried to give it to her. Once I realized that the way I acted wasn't fair to her and all that, I called her and apologized. She thanked me but insisted that it wasn't necessary. She has reached out several times since then, but she has been kinda distant and cold and I don't think she is in a very good place mentally.

Do you think I should ask for a diagnostic assessment? For some of my MH conditions it helped for others it didn't. How does an anxiety diagnostic assessment work/differ to other psychiatric diagnostics (in the UK)? Would it help with other treatment options? (can you even take buspirone long term?)

I know you can't answer this question medically but any personal experiences from those in the UK would be much appreciated. Thank you :)","My anxiety isn't getting much better, should I ask for a diagnosis to help tailor my treatment? (UK based)",1561902463.0

He didn‚Äôt necessarily do anything wrong to me, but we didn‚Äôt work out and I decided to end things. I do not miss him at all, and in fact feel better alone. I have OCD which forces me to constantly think of things that I don‚Äôt want to think about.

Recently, whenever something important/meaningful happens in my life now (like embracing a very close family member, or blowing out candles for my birthday), I think of him. I don‚Äôt think of him fondly, but I am reminded of his existence. Oftentimes, all I can think is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to think of you [my ex-boyfriend].‚Äù  I now feel like I see him in everything, even though I don‚Äôt want to. I just want him gone from my life.

Since I am a rising senior in high school, I‚Äôm touring colleges, and recently found my dream school. However, when I was there, all I could think about was my ex-boyfriend. I was trying to enjoy walking around the campus, but all I thought was how much I didn‚Äôt want to think of him.

The thought of him is putting a stain on everything in my life. What can I do to regain my life back from his presence? Is this an OCD issue?

My boyfriend is a groomsman for one of his best friends since childhood. I don‚Äôt know the bride or grooms very well, met the bride probably twice although we‚Äôve joked and traded memes on Instagram and she seems cool. 

Wedding is about an hour away, I went to the ceremony and while there I sat near the four people I know, but I don‚Äôt really know them that well, except for one.

The one is a guy I went out with for a few weeks. He‚Äôs another childhood friend of my bfs, and I met bf thru him. Yes it‚Äôs weird. He‚Äôs married now to a wonderful woman, but while he‚Äôs not a bad person he‚Äôs sure not my favourite person. There were some consent issues for the time we were seeing each other. Looking back I‚Äôm angry at how I let that stuff slide. 

Anyways, I went to the ceremony, but it wasn‚Äôt too bad because you‚Äôre supposed to focus on what‚Äôs happening. I had to go home between the ceremony and reception to let my dog out.

When I get to the reception, I found out that not only is there a head table so my bf won‚Äôt be sitting with me (he told me there wasn‚Äôt) but I‚Äôm at a table with six people I‚Äôve never met, plus exbf and his wife.

I wound up melting down in the bathroom, and then couldn‚Äôt leave because I didn‚Äôt want anyone to ask why my face looked like shit. Found an emergency exit and snuck out.

Had to go on public transit while still crying. Finally get home and bf has sent me a snarky text message. Half of me is incredibly pissed off that he wouldn‚Äôt have told me these things beforehand, and the other half is just dying of guilt.  

So now I get to continue my anxiety cry plus add guilt tears on the couch while watching Friends and cuddling Dog.

618,Anxiety,"In 2018 June/July, I had unprotected had sex with my then new partner. A month later he told me he was Hepatitis B positive- but if I am vaccinated I am safe and will not get infected. I was both shocked because he had not told me earlier, in denial because we had already had sex &amp; of course generally stressed out with what I had heard. Due to the sheer intensity of this news &amp; to see him emotionally bogged down by any conversation around this conversations, I moved forward somewhat in denial. I accepted what he said about being vaccinated &amp; held belief that I am protected, I turned a blind eye to what the reality might be, had faith that I will not get infected and willingly continued to have sex with him. Initially with protection a few times, and eventually without. However this continued to bother me inside - and even the idea of getting tested would make me fearful. 


Approximately 8/9 months later April, I bucked up the courage and got tested. Very fortunately, the rest reports were negative. I then directly asked my boyfriend to take to me a doctor (this was the second or third time) as I still had lots of questions in my mind- to which he agreed - but we never went. Again, in fear of upsetting him I didn‚Äôt bring it up again. 

Three months later while in a conversation with him - I brought up my interest in going to a doctor. He responded saying ‚ÄòWe already went‚Äô / which then I realised was a slip from his side. He had taken another girl he had an intimate scene with to a doctor. 

He took a girl he was having a scene with to the doctor. But not somebody he is ‚Äòserious‚Äô with. His excuse to this is that I never insisted.

619,Anxiety,"Yesterday I got to see one of my best friends in the first time in a while. He has been hiking the AT. He brought some friends he met on the trail over to his family's house and invited me over. 

I should preface this to maybe help my perspective make more sense. I never smoked pot until I was 22 but then I smoked daily for almost 2 years. I recently stopped as I needed to clear a test for a job. I have however smoked once every few weeks or so. 

So we end up smoking at this little get together and Iui also had a beer which I next to never drink. I became so introverted and possibly even paranoid. It seemed like I was just in the way and there. I seemed to not be able to help or attribute myself to setting up or helping clean. It seemed I only offered my help cleaning when it was part way done. I felt bad for this.  Before smoking I did manage a few conversations with the hikers who I had never met. Got to chat music a little and just enjoy casual small talk. Once I smoked. Nothing. I was almost watching myself outside of my body just being awkward and there. I didn't feel like I belonged. The fact I was even having these thoughts and feelings seem so dumb to me but it's something I couldn't really get out of my head. 

How do I ever actually have conversations? What do you talk about? I work in a place where I talk to hundreds of people daily but I just couldn't find real conversations last night. I found myself so lost in time and overthinking everything. For a bit I thought my friends dad was talking about me from the other room but that could honestly have been paranoia  from the weed. 

I used to be very good at having friends and being social but I just feel I'm losing grip on those skills. I've always been fine at even introducing myself to people and making friends. After the 2 years of smoking I just don't  have it. 

My friend offered to drive me there and I accepted although I wanted to drive and have that control. As the night grew late and all were getting ready to watch a movie and head to sleep I offered for my departure. My friends dad said I could stay and so did my friend. This wasn't part of what I thought would happen and it caught me by surprise. In my anxiety ridden mind I thought it was out of pure sympathy... but these are people I considered family most of my life because of how much they had been there for me. I simply couldn't accept and my mind raced 'where would you sleep ' 'you don't know these other people' 'what if I say stupid things or just don't fit in.' 

Dumb stuff but it happened. I did leave after insisting a few more times within the hour and I still feel so guilty and bad for this. I don't know how to Express any of this to my friend sincerely. I know I'll see him again soon. He heads back for the trail today as yesterday was a rare off day. He will be done in a few weeks and we've planned an idea for a hike.

I feel broken almost. Lonely. I fear of being alone the rest of my life because I lack the ability to just breathe and be myself in a group setting.

A lot of it is all relatable. I feel like I wanna just unload absolutely everything on here because I want to reach out and have others hear me. Others outside of my circle, which is a small circle btw. Just family and friends I can count on one hand. But to them I hide behind a mask. 

I could go on and on starting from the beginning and telling all, but the bitter irony is just the thought of that alone gives me anxiety. Like, I wanna structure it properly and don‚Äôt wanna leave out important things. OCD in a nutshell.

I‚Äôve tried different medications for depression&amp;anxiety, currently on Wellbutrin, but idk if it is really helping or not. I try to convince myself it is, because I wanna feel normal. 

Like I‚Äôve said, I can go forever trying to cover all my shit. Like my OCD, relationships, more in depth about my alcoholism and drug use, yada yada yada... I might go further into detail in future posts, but as for now, I‚Äôll get to the point, the thing I‚Äôm going through right now. I‚Äôve been in and out of several different jobs and periods of unemployment. I‚Äôve fucked up and lost 2 jobs because of drugs and alcohol. Worked a part time summer job last summer. Got laid off and drew unemployment. And as that came to an end had to find something new. I‚Äôm not in as bad of a position that I have been before. Actually I‚Äôm coming up on a year and a month alcohol free. In January I started as a paid on call firefighter. And May I started as a deckhand on the river, something that I‚Äôve wanted to do for a while and applied to many companies and fought hard to get here. I‚Äôm currently on the boat as we speak. But here‚Äôs the thing, now I realize that it is not for me. The work is fine, yeah it‚Äôs hard but I can deal with that. It‚Äôs the 28 days on/14 off schedule. And 6hrs on 6hrs off.

So the first dealer I went to seemed to not care that I was walking round and looking into one model in particular.  I was just about to walk out and he said hello.  Ended up taking a car for a test drive.  Was OK but had a few electrical issue so decided even if I buy one it wouldn't be this car.  I dropped it back and, as the guy was with another customer, just stuck my head on the door and said thanks but it wasn't for me.  He said ""was that the way you found it?"" and pointed to the car.  I thought maybe he was asking about damage or something so I said yes it's the same.  He said ""no it's not, it was backed into that space not driven in"".   I looked at my partner and just said I wasn't confident backing a car I wasn't familiar with into a small space amongst new cars.  As I walked off I could hear him making fun of me to his other customer.

He had another car on the yard I was interested in but given his attitude I decided I'd rather drive 30 mins to another dealer I knew had one to try that.  Got there and they were very nice. Had heaps of the model i wanted to try so could narrow it down.  I told them I wasn't looking to buy today but was just trying to narrow down my options which they seemed happy with. Took it for a drive.  Was very nice and I think was def what I wanted.  Got back and was ushered into a sale manager's office (who referred to my partner as my ""sprog"") who started doing finance paperwork.

I want to use my first post to thank everybody here. Deciding to see my doctor last year was absolutely terrifying; I was so worried that I'd be laughed out of the doctor's office and told there was nothing wrong with me and I was making it all up. Reading peoples' experiences here that matched so well with what I was experiencing gave me the courage to finally make that appointment.

 

In hindsight I shouldn't have been worried about not being taken seriously. I went into my appointment so anxious that I had a heart rate of 130 and was barely able to form coherent sentences. My doctor put me on medication, and after a few months I was doing well enough I was able to start seeing a therapist. I've got a long ways to go but I've made a lot of progress so far. Finally seeing someone about my anxiety was easily the best decision of my life, and I hope anyone reading this who is on the fence about reaching out for help like I was decides to do it.

637,Anxiety,"I‚Äôm 22F and I‚Äôve been dealing with some really bad anxiety for the past year. My anxiety is mainly future oriented, and tiny things can trigger me into an anxiety spiral that leads to a panic attack. For example - if a friend makes a comment about a cute couple, I start to think about how maybe I‚Äôll never be in a relationship again/part of a ‚Äúcute couple‚Äù, I start to imagine myself living all by myself when I‚Äôm old, imagine myself with no kids or grandkids, etc. Then once I get home and am in my room I‚Äôll begin hyperventilating and have a panic attack. 

So as you can probably tell I am absolutely terrified of being lonely. Anytime I want to get something to eat or do something fun I force myself to invite a friend because I don‚Äôt want to be in public by myself. It‚Äôs absolutely awful and I feel clingy but I think I just get scared that doing an activity alone means that I am one step closer to being alone for the rest of my life. Irrational, but I can‚Äôt seem to think a different way.

Combined with the beautiful environment (the college is forest-adjacent) it did wonders for my mental health.  I didn't want to go back home to my dysfunctional family (complete with an imminent divorce) and the shitty little town I grew up in, so I got a job working on campus that would let me stay in town with my new friends.  But on the second day of work, I had the most intense anxiety attack I've ever had.  I was locked in bend with my whole body periodically tensing up.  I also had suicidal thoughts for the second time of my life.  I couldn't get out of bed, so I just went into damage control and talked myself down and contacted my therapist.  Since she's based in my home town, we decided it would be better for me to return home and work on things face-to-face than put my wellbeing at risk.

Although my general anxiety level has been improving overall, I still have this weirdly acute anxiety around working a job.  It's hurt me in the past, but it was never this debilitating.  Now I'm stuck in a shitty living situation without the energy to get out of the house.  Pretty much everything I had in college that helped my anxiety and made me happy is gone now, since I don't really have friends here and the nature here is very sparse.  The only time I can relax and enjoy myself is when I smoke weed, which I know isn't a long-term solution.  Now I'm getting worried that my depression might show up again, and because of some borderline-traumatic experiences with my formerly depressed brother, that's just making my anxiety worse.  On top of that, I also have to work on papers, grad school applications, and next year's housing, so I just really don't know what to do with myself.

647,Anxiety,"Just wondering if anyone has experienced this. I am a 24 year old female and have had anxiety as long as I can remember. It‚Äôs gotten worse over the years and about two years ago I started to notice I was very sensitive to light, had a hard time focusing my eyes, and would see eye floaters constantly. I saw two different eye doctors and was told my eyes were perfectly healthy and floaters are harmless. The other symptoms were probably related to my migraines and the fact that I look at a computer all day every day for work. I even saw a neurologist and had a brain MRI and again was told I was completely healthy.

At this point I was frustrated but told myself I just had to deal with this and hoped it would go away on its own. My anxiety really peaked at this time and I started to go to therapy. I have been in therapy for one year now and have really come a long way. I feel like I am more in control now and that my overall anxiety level is better than it‚Äôs been since I was in high school. 

However, the eye floaters and other eye problems have not gone away. I am pretty convinced at this point that they are just another symptom of anxiety but I‚Äôm not sure how I can manage them. Has anyone had any luck with anxiety medication helping with anxiety eye symptoms?

My boyfriend is usually a huge texter. He left yesterday morning, and being his usual self, sent me a bunch of texts/articles all throughout the day, and even emailed me on top of that. 

Then at about 8 pm, it completely stopped. He just totally stopped responding.

My boyfriend is actually usually the more anxious of us two when it comes to the relationship, but that might be because he gives me more constant reassurance than I usually give him, honestly. We‚Äôve been living together for a year and have never been not available to one another via text.

I‚Äôve never cheated and he has no reason to believe that.

He probably isn‚Äôt, I know. But I‚Äôve had to shake off that intrusive thought all day. 

His college girlfriend, who he dated for years, lives in the city he‚Äôs visiting. I never gave it a second thought, I‚Äôve never accused him of cheating or even suspected it, until this whole AWOL incident. 

It was so odd that he just immediately stopped communicating with me yesterday afternoon/evening, and then all throughout today; it‚Äôs now past midnight. I‚Äôve texted and emailed him in case he lost his phone. No response.

Now, I‚Äôm paranoid that he‚Äôs in jail. Sounds a little ridiculous, but my boyfriend smokes weed socially on occasion, and what if he‚Äôs smoking it with his friends and got caught or something? I know people who have been jailed for this. 

And I know I mentioned it‚Äôs a marathon thing and I suppose he might be busy doing it, but he would have his phone- they make a lot of stops to take pictures and drink at bars, it‚Äôs not just straight running, its a complicated little tradition.

When I got home I messaged my group of friends and and basically was like ""Hey I didn't come to out your way and went somewhere else because it was busy at that shop, but I got check out all the cool stuff I got"" My other buddy, rightfully so, called me out on not going to hang with my friend over getting records.  
  
The friend I didn't go to visit asks me quite often to come and hang out, but i always make some excuse. It's not that I don't want to see him. The issues is that when I do make a plan I get all anxious about it and think about every bad thing that could happen. What if my car breaks down? What if I start to feel sick to my stomach? what if he asks if I want to smoke weed and I fall back into my abusive/addictive ways with weed like I did in the past? What if I call to cancel the plans and I flake on him yet again? Will this be the last straw that breaks out friendship? What if I...etc. It's not like he has ever pressured me and he knows enough that I am trying to stay sober. I have a real nice time with him even if we are not faded. It's not just him I do this with either. The past year or so I really have just become like Stretch Armstrong and keeping everyone at arms length. The biggest thing I realized is this is exactly like what my Dad does/has done for years with my sister and I as well as his own family. If it's not beneficial to me then why bother. It sucks to be one the flip side of that and it feels so selfish and cold shoulderish. I don't like that. I am a very introverted person by nature and really like my alone time, but I also really get upset with myself and sometimes lonely when I do things like that. It also makes me overthink/worry like a motherfucker. I was never really like this when I was getting stoned all the time. I like being sober but I also feel like I was so much happier/carefree and social when I was using. I stopped because I realized that I was using to escape from my problems, but being sober hasn't really helped me figure them out much either. In fact it's made life and overthinking a bit harder.   
  
I did apologize to him (he probably didn't even see what I initially wrote yet). I really want to try to find some way to be less hermit like. I'm not looking for a complete 180  type of change. I know that's never going to be the case. I am who I am, but I would like to get back to at least being a person who has a bit of a life outside of work and my apartment. I am trying not to be so hard on myself as I am glad I was able to see that flaw and want to try to change it, but I do feel sort of shitty about what I said. I am probably doing the typical ProfessorDoctorMF overthinking I always do, but I am going to try to find a way to work on this a little bit.  
  
TL;DR: I was kind of a bad friend and unknowingly flaunted that fact. Got called out on it, and now I see how selfish I seem when my social anxiety hits. I want to try to change that a bit.",I think I just realized how selfish I can be with my social anxiety.,1561872298.0

677,Anxiety,"I've never posted before so here goes nothing: I just recently got married and returned from our honeymoon. It was a 7 day cruise and it was awesome, we've never cruised before and I was relieved to not experience any motion sickness or general weirdness while on board 

For whatever reason, the morning when we finally docked (exactly 2 weeks ago) I had one of the most intense panic attacks ever as soon as I woke up. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 6, so after almost 20 years of managing my anxiety I was surprised at how severe it was. I really thought I was going to die. I was shaking, my thoughts were racing, I was extremely warm, and it finally calmed down a little after waking my husband up. I was thinking it was likely because we had been moving for so long that being still weirded me out, however we had docked and gotten off the boat a couple of times over that 7 day period so I couldn't be sure. 

Fast forward to a few hours later; we got off the boat and even did a tour/airboat ride through the Everglades in Florida. Things had been going well and we had a late night flight home, so we expected a fairly long day at the airport. It ended up getting delayed until the next morning, and the panic attacks were nonstop from about 1:00PM to 1:00AM. I was dizzy as hell, and scared myself so bad thinking it was a medical emergency because I really wasn't sure what was going on. I was worried I wouldn't be able to get on the plane and survive the flight, but I did. My husband was willing to sleep at the airport but they were giving out hotel vouchers, and I told him if we didn't get out of the airport I wouldn't be able to stop the panic. We got to the hotel, I slept a few hours, and got home with no delays. 

Basically the whole first week we were home, I was still suffering from extremely bad panic attacks. Last Thursday I had my husband take me to urgent care, the whole time telling myself that if I'm unable to be seen that I'm going to die. I was shaking so violently and unable to describe my symtoms very well, which made the anxiety worse. The doctor was extremely reassuring and told me it wasn't any of the horrible things that I thought it might be (a stroke, seizure, mal de debarqument, etc). 

This past week has been much better but I have noticed it tends to creep up on me out of nowhere, especially at night. The dizziness that was triggering the attacks has gone away for the most part but I still catch my heart rate elevating, and my mind starts to race. I honestly feel like the panic attacks I experienced at the airport completely destroyed my coping mechanisms and that my brain is struggling to recover. I've never panicked for such a long period of time, and this is coming from someone who has experienced a lot due to my anxiety in general throughout my life.

Basically anything that I accomplish is significant to me at this point, like going out to dinner or going shopping. 

I guess what I'm looking for are people who have had similar experiences, any coping tips, anything related to anxiety at night...the one thing that seems to help the most is breathing in for 5 seconds, then breathing out for another 5 seconds.

I've been taking Zoloft for years now, and my anxiety has been under control for the most part until 2 weeks ago. Since then I've also been taking hydroxyzine but my body is getting used to it now and it hasn't been as helpful as it was at first. I've been to therapy and learned about a lot of coping mechanisms. I'm thinking it's time to go back to therapy, and I'm also considering something like Xanax for when the panic really sets in but I don't want to take more medication or take a chance with getting addicted to something. 

It's completely irrational but feels so real, especially with physical symptoms, and I think that's what makes anxiety such a difficult thing.

Has anyone had this problem? I've had friends and families give me this kind of talk where they think they're sounding encouraging by telling me ""See?! I told you you're having fun!"" As if I'm still a child being a pouty little brat that doesn't want to accept that i am indeed having fun.

Here's an example: 

A few years ago i went to a free concert with my roommates at the time. I wasn't sure if i wanted to go because i don't enjoy tight crowds and people forcing their way to stand in front of me. When i told my roomies about this problem, one of them said to not let it go to my head and i should just have fun. Well, i went with them, and i was having fun... until my roommate turned to me and said ""See? I told you you're having fun!""

My smile immediately went away and i left the concert by myself during the intervention. 

Like jesus fucking christ, why do people think it's okay to draw attention to me having fun as if they're trying to win an argument or something? It makes me think other people are watching me enjoy myself and then i feel self conscious about it.

695,Anxiety,"I made this account purely to get some advice.My boyfriend was diagnosed with severe generalized anxiety, social anxiety and Aspergers. We are both in the same Masters program (we have a six year age gap - if that matters) and we met 8 months ago. I feel a lot of pressure and have developed some anxiety myself since I've been in this relationship. I do feel like I'd be an asshole if I left him because of his anxiety too. I really really need advice. Below I've outlined the ways in which his anxiety affects me:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Since we are in academia at a competitive program we have a lot of assignments as well as side projects and work. Before every deadline, he has a massive breakdown and I need to basically do all of his assignment because he says he just cannot. Moreover, he keeps asking for validation that he's not stupid (which he isn't) and that I still respect him - WHILE I do his work along with mine. It doesn't help that I also need to keep reassuring him that it will work out - as he keeps telling me I won't be able to finish both assignments. Sometimes he reads over my work while I'm still working on it and starts panicking about something he doesn't understand (understandably since he hasn't done the research I did) and I need leave everything I'm doing and sit down and explain it to him.

&amp;#x200B;

2) He wants me to apply next year since he wants me to focus on helping him apply this year. He thinks I'm too young to be in a PhD program and said that if he doesn't get in this year he will kill himself. He also made it clear that he does not want to compete with me during applications and I should wait.

&amp;#x200B;

3) When I ask him to get therapy he says he can only work with a strong alpha male therapist which he is unable to find. Further, he says he's always afraid that people will hate him and leave him because of his anxiety and that he feels broken and I feel guilty for even bringing it up.

&amp;#x200B;

4) When I tried to get therapy he freaked out when he found out that I spoke to my therapist about him and said I wasn't allowed to do that because he knew they would ask me to leave him. I'm further not allowed to talk to my friends about this or journal about it or even look anything up since he checks my history. I made a new account for this and will have to delete my history after I post this.

&amp;#x200B;

5) My self esteem is close to 0 because every time I achieve something, he feels bad that he did not achieve it and I basically have to downplay my victories when sharing it with him.

It's then hard to get comfortable again because the sheets and pillows are so wet. I don't wake my partner to ask if we can change them. She needs her sleep too.

But I was wondering how other people deal with their paranoid thoughts/obsessive thoughts? For example, I‚Äôll be eating a banana I got from the store and think ‚Äúwow, how clean is this banana? What if an outbreak breaks out from the food that we buy at the store? What if the food we‚Äôre eating is slowly killing us? Should I do more research into what I‚Äôm eating and where I buy my food?‚Äù and then this continues to spiral more and more until I end up somewhere completely weird and scary and irrational

701,Anxiety,"My anxiety has been horrible the past month, I've only been this bad once before. I hurt a friend (unintentionally) and it's been eating away at me. The anxiety-related symptoms, overthinking, guilt and worry have been too much to handle. The anxiety and self-hatred built up and then someone contacted me the other night pretending to be this person, got my hopes up and made a fool of me. It pushed me over the edge. I sat there with a bottle of alcohol and a handful of trazadone, I was ready to end everything. The one thing that stopped me being that if the person I hurt ever found out that I'd killed myself, I wouldn't have wanted her to feel like it was her fault, because that would have been a horrible thing to live with and my mental health is not her fault anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that I have a dad who practically hates me too. The constant anxiety and has really taken its toll on my health; I've fainted twice, I feel so stressed and low, my OCD traits are returning, I've dropped a tonne of weight, my chest feels funny. I finally felt wanted and it was so nice. I had to go and fucking mess it up. As someone who has never had anyone show them any interest and always been made to feel a freak, it felt so good to have someone interested in me for once. I spent my late teenage years being so isolated and I still am, I've had to deal with blackmail, harassment and that shit is still following me to this day. I've had my name dragged through the dirt for years by a stalker and as a result people's judgement of me really concerns me. Its so horrible having to worry that people judge me on made up lies about me and this causes me so much anxiety and worries me that it is part of the reason why she ended things. I don't want to live like this any more, worrying that my whole life is dictated by stuff I haven't even done by some obsessed schizophrenic cunt, it's not fair and I'm fucking fed up. It's not life, when you're always worrying.

&amp;#x200B;

I was terrified of losing her and came on too strong because of that. With this person it felt like I had found the Malaria to my Grim (from Grim Adventures). She made me happy, even when just friends and we had a lot in common. For most people, loosing a close friend would probably be trivial but for me it was quite a big deal, especially a friend that liked me in more than just friends way. It felt so nice having someone who was interested and wanted to talk everyday. I just feel so alone, I don't make friends very easily and I opened myself up to this person, which is something I don't usually do. We were really close and the way she ended things didn't give me any closure, just anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a bad person, I just made an awful mistake. I didn't think. And as a result of my anxiety, I've done some things I'm not proud of this past month. I've come to accept the fact that she hates my guts. And I'm letting go because I don't want to cause her any further pain. I really cared about her and can't forgive myself for it. I thought she was great. I'm so fucking lost and I hate myself so much. If its not one thing I'm worrying about, then its another. I just want to be happy for once.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not good at sitting with uncertainty and worry that I upset someone I cared about. I'd never have done anything to hurt her intentionally, but I hate myself for what I did. I'd love the speak to her again, but I know she won't forgive me. The anxiety has been hell the past month and I don't know what to do. I'm so ashamed of myself that I've let my mental health deteriorate like this. I'm always going to be fucked in the head, I just want to feel normal for once.

716,Anxiety,"I'm 16F and my anixety has worsened over the past few months.  It didn't affect me physically to the extent that it does now. I spiral at the littlest of inconveniences but I've never had to deal with a trigger that was so damn inescapable, that I couldn't even step away from. My parents have always fought a lot and it was kinda annoying but I was desensitized to it for the most of my life so it didn't affect me much. 

However, this changed a few months ago when they had the biggest and most serious fight I've ever witnessed. I was fully convinced that they would both murder each other or hurt their own selves. I had the worst anxiety attack that day. I seriously felt my life flashing before my eyes, the floor was spinning and I felt like my legs were empty, like they would give away and I would collapse. I was feeling so light-headed and I felt like my heart was going to burst out of my ribcage. I actually had to run away to calm down. I collapsed in the elevator and it took me about five minutes to feel even remotely stable again. It felt like I was having a heart attack. I felt nauseous and completely drained even hours after it was over. It was so hard for me to calm down, I felt on edge the whole day and kept losing it at the slightest hints that it would happen again.

It's not much better now. I've never had as frequent anxiety attacks as I do now. They used to be very rare and only in the face of extreme triggers. Now, I have them nearly everyday, especially on weekends when my dad is home and my mom and dad have to spend more time together. 

We're not doing the best financially so my entire family kind of shares a single room. The only privacy I have is in the bathroom or the balcony.

I lose it every time they have the slightest disagreement or argument because I keep fearing that it will escalate to the level that it did that day. Them yelling, which is very often, is enough to give me a full blown anxiety attack followed by a ton of bathroom trips because it's even messing with my digestive system now.

I often try to mediate but it's so damn hard when it feels like I'm going to faint. I'm not the best at maintaining a poker face so they've started noticing how much it affects me. They try not to fight as much as they used to but it's unavoidable because they can't get along. 

When it happens, I can't even leave the situation and am forced to stay in the room because my dad thinks I'm losing my mind and if I keep this up, do I plan on running away from every conflict in my life? So breathing exercises and distractions are kind of useless when you can't even remove yourself from the trigger.

I don't have access to therapy. Mental illnesses are very stigmatized around here, my dad genuinely believes that it's a conspiracy by the medical industry so psychologists can exploit the insecurities of their clients and hook them to drugs. He thinks they fricking plant mental illnesses into people's heads. I've tried challenging that but both of my parents lose their temper at the mere suggestion that something may be wrong with me. They're aware of the physical symptoms as well but they think it's all in my head and I'll be okay once I stop overreacting. (Which technically is true but how to not overreact is the damn problem which they don't understand)

I'm trying to get a summer job or internship so I have to spend less time at home but I really need some sort of coping mechanism. I'm tired of feeling this so damn often.

I'm already shaking and dreading it. It's just for 3 days yet I can't stop panicking. I'm going to a huge city (I also live in a big city but the one I'm going to is way bigger), I don't know anyone there, I don't speak their language. And to make it even worse, I'm going to travel from that one big city to another big one. That means having to talk to people, buy tickets, figure out how their public transport works, etc, I'm already overwhelmed just thinking about it. I know I'll do great, I just... can't stop packing. And I don't know whether I'm more worried about all this, or the plain fact that I might have a panic attack there and get this dreadful feeling like I'm about to die 24/7.

731,Anxiety,"My dad started talking to me about at least exercising for 45 minutes a day, and I already felt like shit because that means I‚Äôm being a fat and lazy piece of shit, but now he notices too and thinks I‚Äôm being useless. 

We started to argue, but I was just frustrated that I couldn‚Äôt tell him what he wanted me to. I couldn‚Äôt answer his questions, and if I did he just kept prying deeper and deeper. 

Well why do you think you‚Äôre improving? 
I‚Äôm focusing on eating better and being kinder to myself. 
Well how are you doing that? 
.....I don‚Äôt know.... I‚Äôm just.... cooking two meals a day and-
Well go to the library and read books about it. 

I felt like he was telling my I have to be constantly challenging myself. 
It went on like this for a couple of minutes until I shutdown, and just stoped responding. Occasionally I would say something and then regret it. He just wouldn‚Äôt go. 

I told him I wanted to stop talking and he said I couldn‚Äôt run away from everything. I tried not to and I tried to end the conversation for what felt like hours. By this point I was crying, and I had that lump in my throat. So I just got up and went to the bathroom and had a small crying session curled up on the toilet. 

I was waiting and hoping he would leave while I was in the bathroom but he didn‚Äôt. 

He asked me to come out of the bathroom and finish the conversation, then I told him i was overwhelmed and needed to be left alone. 

But he didn‚Äôt leave me alone. He sat outside of the door and kept arguing with me.

At this point I was kind of sobbing, my eyes were puffy and I couldn‚Äôt breath right. 

It was difficult for me to think, everything was just so threatened in my head. At this point, it was hard to actually listen to him and respond. Talking was so hard, so I just sat there and tried to distract myself. 

After I stopped responding he would knock on the door, louder and louder. I was afraid he would break the door open and continue to argue face to face. 

So I went out, and good lord it didn‚Äôt end. It was a full hour of my curling into myself and crying and sobbing and gasping for air and hyperventilating.  I kept on telling him I want to be left alone. That I felt overwhelmed, and he just said that I can‚Äôt run away, and we need to figure out how to communicate.

At this point in time I was so panicked I was shaking and couldn‚Äôt breath and my lips and eyes were swollen and I honestly just wanted it to end. I kept on thinking when will it stop. 

Then after what seemed like hours he said he would give me a few minutes, and then we‚Äôd talk later. 

I then moved into the corner of my room, wedged between a coffee table. 

When he came back he hugged me, and I hated it. I didn‚Äôt want to be touched at all. It felt like I was being smothered, I couldn‚Äôt breath. But I couldn‚Äôt tell him not to touch me because I know he‚Äôs upset because he cares for me and just wants to help me. So I sat there, just silently crying. I managed to stop hyperventilating so he would leave me alone. 

And now, 30 minutes after, I have made a mini fort with my dresser and mattress. I am in a tiny square with pillows, blankets, drawing stuff and some water. Currently I never want to leave this tiny square, and if someone talks to me, especially if they ask me a question, I‚Äôll begin to violently sob.  

This is the most shaken, scared and panicked I‚Äôve ever been in my entire life. All because my dad wanted me to go to the gym 45 minutes a day, which is a reasonable request.

To cut to the point, I already have GAD. Had to pause college by a year to go off and deal with it (about 4 years ago). Found CBT very helpful, went back to college, joined a professional graduate programme and haven't been bothered by it since. Great success.

&amp;#x200B;

Skin hasn't been so successful - I've tried everything but it just won't go. Went to my GP who referred me to a consultant dermatologist. He believes roaccutane is inevitable, and tbh so do I. Nothing else has cleared it despite over 15 years of trying. The pill, antibiotics, they work initially and then as soon as I stop, acne comes back.

Basically, I think most people know the reputation Roaccutane has. I would love to hear the experiences of people who have gone on it with a preexisting anxiety disorder.

738,Anxiety,"I don't even know what's wrong with me anymore. I'm not sure if the symptoms I'm experiencing are from anxiety or if they're actually there and serious. It's driving me crazy. I'd like to know if anyone has gone through anything similar.

To preface, I've always had issues with anxiety. I saw a psychologist in the past due to issues with 'Pure O' OCD, and I would label myself a hypochondriac (I've gone through many different periods where I thought I was dying, including heart problems, cancers, MS/ALS, rabies - got this one really bad, and tetanus). With my long history of dealing with stress poorly and not being the healthiest I could be... ironically enough, that's keeping me from losing my mind completely right now.

Almost my entire body has experienced loss of sensation for a long time now (well over a year). Sometimes it feels like I have better days than others in terms of my physical numbness, and I do feel as if I've regained a bit of feeling back sometimes (particularly my genitals - they were more numb in the past and now they feel slightly more sensitive).

Recently, and I mean within the past few months, I feel like my right side is considerably more numb than my left. I don't know if that's due to my left side getting better or if my right side is getting worse, but I would say my left side feels... pretty normal? I don't know what the norm is anymore.

I finally took the plunge and got an appointment with a GP to get it looked at. I figured it wasn't normal to go on for so long like that... oh boy, I went through hell a few days ago. I went down a spiral of panic I've never experienced before. I felt like I was dying, there was that unreal sinking feeling through my entire being... I'm sure many of you understand completely.

I read up on something because I'm horrible at keeping my eyes away from Google. I was reading about MS... and, apparently, MS sufferers can have complications walking. Well guess what happened to me? My legs started to feel off balance. They starting having adrenaline pour through them non-stop, making me feel like I want to go run a mile but also not move an inch. It was both a lethargic and energizing feeling, and I absolutely hated it.

It spread to my arms. I feel this 'excited' state in my legs and arms (it's mostly my arms now, maybe because I started worrying about them more). My grip (particularly in my left hand) kinda sucks. I've been obsessing over testing it out. I'll put my phone in my hand, grip it, and shake it around furiously to see if my grip will fail me and my phone will fall. I've taken cartons of milk and stretched them out with that arm to see if it'll just fall right out (I can only hold it out for a few seconds but that's a hard exercise and I'm not particularly strong). I've dropped down and done push-ups to see if my legs and/or arms would fail me while doing that.

My arms feel pretty useless right now. They feel heavy and I don't want to use them because it feels like a chore. They feel slightly fatigued and I've gotten some pains around my upper bicep (probably because I'm doing all this stupid shit constantly for a few days now). My grip feels unreliable at best, it feels like things will fall out of my hands at any minute (they haven't, and I've gone about my days without falling down or dropping stuff, but it feels so, so, so much harder to do it than before). I'm worried that I'm showing clinical weakness rather than perceived weakness, and I'm worried that my muscles are going through atrophy. I'm constantly comparing my right side to my left side. I've lost a decent amount of weight over the past few weeks and I'm worried that it's actually muscle mass that's being lost (I've actually fixed by sleeping schedule and eating habits slightly before all of this, and I also haven't ate much the past few days due to my anxious state, so...).

An important note: my muscles have felt similar to this before. Over the past number of months, I'd go through random 2-3 days phases where my muscles and grip felt weak and horrible. I was at school so I had to power through it, and I could still do everything, but they felt like this. A sickly adrenaline, felt like I could barely hold my phone in front of my face, etc. If this was something serious (say, ALS) wouldn't I be in a lot worse state right now, about 2-3-4 months later? Do you guys think it could be worse now than it was when I had it back then because I had a pretty big panic attack (I'd say)?

I'm not looking for reassurance (okay, yes I am) and, as I've said, I have an appointment with my GP in a few days to get the ball rolling on all of this, but I'm stick in limbo right now. I want to know if anyone else has experienced this so I can either A) get mentally prepared for a bad diagnosis or B) start learning how to handle my health anxiety and anxiety in general. I've tried looking up more stuff on muscle weakness and the only times people have had it as bad as me or worse than me was when they had a deeper issue (like MS). Can regular anxiety/panic really make all of your limbs feel useless?

Anxiety Hack #1: Get up and move your body!
It‚Äôs pretty hard to give in to feelings of anxiety when you‚Äôre engaged in physical activity and those happy hormones, or endorphins, are getting released. This hack works best if you start moving as soon as you begin to experience those anxious thoughts and the adrenaline creeping in because it‚Äôll prevent the anxiety from escalating. Choose a type of exercise you enjoy or even something childlike, such as bouncing on a trampoline or doing the ‚ÄúCotton-Eyed Joe.‚Äù I dare you to try one of those and not crack a giggle. Also, if possible, take it outside for the extra benefits of sunlight, fresh air, and a dose of vitamin D. 

Anxiety Hack #2: BREATHE.
One of the most effective and simple deep breathing exercises for calming anxiety and overall relaxing is the 4-7-8 breathing technique developed by Dr. Andrew Weil (based off of pranayama yoga.) 
Here‚Äôs how you do it:
Find a quiet and comfortable place to either lie down or sit up straight with good posture.
Rest the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, right behind your front teeth.
Let your lips part and make an obnoxious whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.
Then, with your lips closed, inhale through your nose as you count to 4.
Hold that breath for 7 counts.
Exhale from your mouth for 8 counts. Don‚Äôt forget the annoying ‚Äúwhoooooooshhhhh!‚Äù It‚Äôs key. ;)
Do this at least four times.

Anxiety Hack #3: Repeat affirmations.
Saying affirmations out loud to yourself may seem out there, but can be extremely powerful when it comes to taming anxiety. The following affirmations have worked for me at the peak of an anxiety attack when I‚Äôve felt crippled by that impending feeling of doom and darkness. 
‚ÄúI am okay.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here before. This too shall pass.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am more than my anxiety.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will transform my anxiety into positive, calming energy.‚Äù
‚ÄúI breathe out tension and breathe in serenity.‚Äù
‚ÄúI breathe out fear and breathe in love.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will overcome this like I always do. I am getting stronger and stronger.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am safe within myself. There is nothing to fear.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy body is filled with loving and calming energy.‚Äù

Anxiety Hack #4: Write it out.
Journaling, or just jotting down those thoughts that are running through your mind at the speed of light, in the moment can bring you some peace. If you don‚Äôt have a journal, use the notes section of your phone and write out whatever thoughts you have running through your mind. Whether it‚Äôs a to-do list of things you need done by the end of the week, a poem, or a bunch of swear words, writing it down (or typing it out) is a form of release. Trust me, you will feel some tension lift.

Anxiety Hack #5: Listen to feel good music.
Music has a powerful effect on your mood and energy. The key is to listen to happy, calming music, even if that‚Äôs not the type of music in your Spotify library. Choose music that reflects the way you want to feel and that will soothe your anxious mind. Personally, my go-to for happy, relaxing beats is anything by Kygo, Sam Feldt, or Bonobo.

Anxiety Hack #6: Get in touch with your spiritual side.
Connecting to a higher power is pretty much a guaranteed way of calming down feelings of anxiety. Whether you choose to pray, meditate, chant mantras, or hold crystals, doing something spiritual will help ground you and give you peace of mind. My favorite way to calm my restless mind at night is to take an epsom salt bath, turn on my latest Headspace meditation, close my eyes, and just focus on my breathing. Actually, this combines three anxiety hacks into one 10-minute activity - meditating (getting in touch with my spiritual side), deep breathing (hack #2), and self-care (hack #7). 

Anxiety Hack #7: Show yourself some tender love and self-care.
There‚Äôs nothing better than stopping an anxiety attack in its tracks by doing something pleasurable for your mind and body. When you feel those dreaded, worry-filled thoughts manifest in your body as a rapid heartbeat or sweaty palms, throw your hands up, say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough!‚Äù and go treat your poor body like royalty. Get a massage, give yourself a facial treatment, get a mani-pedi, take a bath, get your hair did, anything that you know will make you feel good, physically. Taking care of yourself and your body is therapeutic. Self-care is a form of self-love and self-love produces positive thoughts and emotions, which crowd out those negative, fearful feelings.

Anxiety Hack #8: Love your anxiety.
Yes, you read that right. One of the ways we tend to make our anxiety worse is by judging it and ourselves as something negative and horrible that needs fixing. If there‚Äôs one thing you take away from reading this article, I hope it‚Äôs this -  every belief or behavior has a positive intention, therefore any negative thoughts or destructive behaviors are not the problem. They are just the best solution you have come up with so far.
What if, instead of looking at your anxiety as something you hate and want to ‚Äúfix‚Äù, you saw it as the only way your mind knows how to cope with whatever it is you are dealing with? What if you looked at your battles with anxiety as victories that make you a stronger person? What if you listened to what your anxiety is trying to tell you and focus on fixing that problem?
The thing about anxiety is, we put so much energy, time, and money into trying to heal the symptoms of anxiety when what we really need to heal is the fear or trauma that triggers this unnerving cascade in the first place. Which brings me to the last hack‚Ä¶

Anxiety Hack #9: Listen to and get acquainted with your body.
If you‚Äôre experiencing symptoms of anxiety and you have no clue why or where they‚Äôre coming from, it‚Äôs time to take a closer look at your lifestyle choices and health. Three of the top anxiety triggers are caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. If you‚Äôre consuming any or all of these, try eliminating them from your diet for a few weeks, preferably a full month. Then, slowly add one in at a time to see how your body responds. Chances are, you won‚Äôt go back and if you do, you‚Äôll find a healthier and more moderate way to integrate it into your lifestyle. 
Health issues, hormonal imbalances, and food allergies can also trigger anxiety. Make sure you know what‚Äôs going on inside your body. Knowledge about your body‚Äôs natural tendencies and providing your body with nourishing, whole foods is groundbreaking when it comes to managing your anxiety. Once you‚Äôre more in touch with your body and its needs, you begin to trust your mind and body and their reactions. You‚Äôll begin to feel energy shifts when you walk into rooms or engage with others. Your intuition becomes clearer and you‚Äôll be able to tell the difference between ‚Äúgood vibes‚Äù and ‚Äúbad vibes‚Äù...and act accordingly.",9 Hacks To Get A Handle On Your Anxiety Right Now,1561703806.0
758,Anxiety,"Hello, good pople

At first, I'd like to apologize for the mistakes I'm gonna make throughout this post as English is my second language and I feel the lack of knowledge in CBT in general to manage my emotions myself.

So I have a relationship wit my girlfriend for almost 3 years. All of this time it was not ok meaning that it has always some amount of anxiety. All the time there is a scent of a game - one gives and the other doesn't seem to need it. I've cheated once when we had ""hard times"" and after a year I've told her about it. Actually it was my ex. So it's kinda double fuck-up - doing this and telling it to my girlfriend. I've always seem to be co-dependent in relationships starting from school. Always trying to please a girl and by age of 32 I seem to lose my identity completely.

I have a somewhat good job (but I wanna have the better one), I have a hobby (playing drums which I'm not playing actually, I'm always only TRYING to get to concistency of praticing it), I almost have no friends. This inner-picture of myself is very infant and I cannot rely on myself completely so I get dependent very easily.

And as you know when you get denpendent the easiest way is just to switch the object of the dependence. It looks like I'm always in search of a home, the lost meaning of it.

With that being said, I constantly feel the lack of attention and strength to go on without trying to contribute to the poor relationships that I have. And I can't get out of this cycle. I know that the reason is that I lack self-love in the first place but I get doomed so easily so the proactivity seems to go away so rapidly, I cannot get into the vibe and I'm going down the spiral.

I'm seeing my therapist once in a while but she has not much free time for me. On the last session I've learned that I need to be more aware of the things I want to do in my life, starting from the littlest things as which way to go during a walk or which food to eat. It kinda helps but at the point of emotional stress it all gets senseless. But in fact she got the point - I've been numb to my own intentions for a huge amount of time trying to get someone's attention.

I don't know what actual problem I'm trying to address and I know it's an old story but I need some conversation or advice. Maybe there are some online sessions I could take?",Self-identity and self-love - how and WHY to get it,1561827087.0
759,Anxiety,"So I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), which causes me to worry about EVERYTHING. Most of my worries revolve around my health. Every little ache and pain that I feel sends my mind into worst case scenario mode and then I spend the next several days worrying about dying.

765,Anxiety,"This is my own copy/paste below from a previous comment I made to vent. I realize now that there's an anxiety subreddit. And everything below still remains the same, but I'll add a bit more to the end. 

I was just diagnosed with anxiety. I had no idea what it was like before. I just thought people were nervous like a test. At least for me that just mild. It's more like if I'm going to live the next day because something must be wrong with me. It doesn't make sense that I can just sit innocently on my couch, watching a movie, eating dinner, and all of a sudden I look at my girlfriend and tell her I think i'm going to die.

I sustained a leg injury from a back injury (sciatica maybe) and it just got so bad. Slept for maybe 1-2 hours total for 2 weeks when my leg issue started. Then randomly, I remember just talking to my physio therapist to help my sciatica and just before we even started, I remember a huge ringing in my ear, and then my head got super cloudy and almost felt dense. I just felt like life was leaving my body and told her I think my heart stopped. She laid me down seconds away from passing out. That was the first time. The second time, on the couch, and my heart was minimum 100bpm for no reason. And I remember panicking as fuck. Telling her not to let me die. Telling her to call my mom. What do I do. Do I call 911? I called my mom. Voice was shaking uncontrollably, trying to be as calm as possible. Fianc√© instructing me to breathe as she rubs my back. I can't stop telling her I love her. Mom says go to the hospital now. I say I can't make it. I get off the phone. Call 911. Ambulance is at my house in 4 minutes. I'm laying on the couch now. I'm hooked up to their EKG, and they were insanely calm. Told me I'm going to be okay and I'm not having a heart attack. I'm not going to die. They administered my prescribed/Rx Lorazepam and swallowed. Heart rate went down... They said they don't need to take me to the hospital because it's not life threatening, so I signed my waiver and took their word for it.

Since then, I caved and made a large post on social media for anyone on my friends list. I barely use Facebook but I creep alot just to stay up to date. This was a 3:30 in the morning because I couldn't sleep. Any time I try to sleep is my nightmare because that's when my walls come down. Idle hands and mind are the devils playground. So all day, all night I just wonder if I'm gonna make it. So so so many people reached out to me, and told me that I'm okay. And that they too have never told anyone they have been dealing with it for years. They thought they were alone. I thought I was alone. I cried for the first time in maybe 5 years. I cried hard. I just want to live. I'm crying as I type this.

It made me so humble. I held my fianc√© closer. I just celebrated my 5 year anniversary together with her and she's my rock. I think i'm going to be okay. Every day is a struggle. I'm going to be okay.

I just love everything and anyone.

Thank you for listening. This is extremely unlike me.

Now the addition: I have no idea what the trigger is. If there even is one. I know what seems to possibly set me off. But then also doing nothing at all, and thinking of absolutely nothing can set me off.

I tried CBD oil, 2 different brands. None of them do a thing. I don't do alcohol anymore even though it was a rare occasion. With summer here, I used to drink more frequently, like one or two beers every few days. I used to smoke weed for a few years daily. I havent smoked regularly since I'd say 2 weeks ago. I decided to try a super super small amount 2 days ago, but I felt a feeling that was not usual so I just stopped then and there.

This morning I woke up, and I'd just lay there in bed calmly with the birds in the background. I was cruising Facebook, and I don't post often anyway, I just like to stay up to date. I have my fan blowing on me. And I just felt off all of a sudden. I felt a bit short of breath. So I stood up and my heart just started racing, and Im looking at my fianc√© and her mom and I'm just like ""man, I just feel really hot in my chest."" and I started breathing, and my hands and feet became clammy. It didn't get further than that, but now 2 hours later, and the heart beat is fine now, it's regular in the 70s, but my heart still feels tired. And I'm yawning more now. And that's after maybe 9 hours of sleep.

Im trying to rationalize that I'm not dying... But it's hard when I'm so hyper aware of my heart. Doctor said everything is fine when I last saw him almost 2 weeks ago. I'm just feeling stuck.

Im finding myself looking at my spouse of 3.5 years and not recognizing her. Like she is a new person in my life. I am unable to recall most of my memories of our times together.

Then she broke up with him &amp; at one point after we were hanging out with her other friend and he was like didn't this this and this red flag thing happen and I was like woah would you ever have told me any of that? It made me really sad because it just showed me how much our friendship was worth in that moment.

This week, my anxiety was the best its been in more than five months. I actually felt like I was some semblance of myself again.

Then, last night out of absolutely nowhere, I and a panic attack, It was a little one, only lasted about a minute, but the feeling was unmistakable. That feeling that you could drop dead at any minute.

Today, my Mom told me that my Grandfather has a blockage near his heart. He might need surgery to fix it, and heart surgery is a really serious thing. He's also at immediate risk of a heart attack. I can't stop all of the what ifs clamoring around in my mind. I can't shake the picture of my Grandmother all alone in that big house. It's horrible. 

Everything is flooding back again. I can feel the stress of it all dragging me back down and there's nothing that I can do to make it stop. 

I was doing so well, then today hit me like a ton of bricks.","I was doing really well with my anxiety, but something happened, and I can feel it sinking its claws back into me",1561780082.0
783,Anxiety,"So I started driving at 24 years old. I‚Äôm 25 now. I‚Äôm pretty good driving to places like work and the grocery store. But I can‚Äôt drive to another grocery store. Or another gas station. I have to like pick and plan my commute to my gas station, or even my bank. If I‚Äôm in another area, I avoid going to the closest bank branch or gas station, I have to drive home, then drive to that particular bank or gas station. I can‚Äôt just decide to go to another one, I‚Äôd have to know a route there that I practiced.

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt really go to another destination, it‚Äôs I avoid it. And when I push through, bad things tend to happen. Yesterday I went to FedEx to drop off an RMA package, and I had to take this really windy road I never go on. But I‚Äôve been on it before, I just get anxious taking it. And sure enough, I blew through a stop sign and had to swerve right to stay on the road, I didn‚Äôt see the stop sign, I didn‚Äôt know the road was going to slight right like that. It‚Äôs like things like this kill me, I beat myself up over it.

&amp;#x200B;

It was just a few weeks ago but my Dad and I were driving to an area I‚Äôve never been to, and the ride was okay for the most part until Google told me take the second left and I did but then it started rerouting and I was on the parkway and I had to merge and I have very little highway experience and all I know is to speed up to merge but there was no way, it was too busy. I was freaking out and I was trying to merge but then I almost merged into another car... And my Dad is in the passenger seat making it no better, he‚Äôs over 60 and has driving anxiety big time.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my brother starting calling and I looked away for one second and I almost hit a telephone pole. And then on our way back, I went into two really deep potholes and my car started making all sorts of sounds, and I pulled into a parking lot and just as I did, the noises stopped like whatever got stuck inside the wheel got back out. Which was a relief but I just felt like a terrible driver. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt even be on the road...

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing is, this stuff never happens when I drive where I know... It happens when I go more than a few miles from my house, I end up doing stupid shit. And then I feel like absolute shit and feel debilitated. I end up telling people I can‚Äôt do things because I‚Äôd have to drive and I can‚Äôt drive there. I hear people all the time going on road trips but I can‚Äôt even manage driving to the most basic places. I avoid it at all costs and when I do try, and I don‚Äôt mess up, I still don‚Äôt feel any better about it.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn‚Äôt help that I have huge issues talking to people. It‚Äôs like I have foot in mouth syndrome. It‚Äôs just getting to me, it‚Äôs been over a year I‚Äôve been driving and I feel crippled at it. I just don‚Äôt leave the house unless it‚Äòs for work or some place I know how to get to.

I think there's mice droppings under my kitchen sink? How do I get rid of this. Even opening the sink I'm now worried about hantavirus. Is there an easy fix for this hole? Can I just tape it? 

And then also I turned the ac on and I think it was blowing soot out from the heater? The ac is in the roof but I think it blows air into the heater and this soot is coming out and it's on the floor. It crumbles easily so I think it's soot or something but is that safe?

Also there's that random thing in one of the cabinets. I haven't touched it and don't know what it is. 

Finally there's this hole that I had already noticed in the closet but I didn't think much except roaches until now seeing the probable mice droppings. 

How do I clean this all up or fix it so I can start feeling safe in my home. I'm normally not this bad but stress especially triggers my hypochondria / health anxiety / generalized anxiety. Please help I feel so stupid

Last week my mother fell and fractured her hip which required surgery to fix it. She was adamant not to have surgery and wanted to let it heal naturally despite doctors professional advice. It took our family 2 days to convince her to have surgery which was meant to take place 48 hours of the incident.

Now she is refusing to take medication from doctors such as pain killers, antibiotics, blood thinners because she is worried that nurses are prescription the wrong medication to her and is worried that it will cause more harm than good because her leg is now swollen. Because of this, she is now taking the antibiotics. It's been really frustrating on both medical staff and our family because the longer she stays in the hospital, the higher the chance of other health complications.

As the title says I am right now experiencing a bad bout of anxiety that's making me want to just lock myself up and cry my eyes out. And worst part is I know it's for something really trivial but these things bother me alot! 

So a lil background, I'm doing 2 classes simultaneously one is a dance class and one is a professional course (marketing) I'm not currently working. And both these classes are on the weekend but different timings. 

Today however the dance class is just before my marketing class and I have to travel 30-40 minutes from one part of the city to another! And I can't bunk the dance one (cz it's technical rehearsal for our performance tomorrow) can't bunk the marketing one today (cz I'll be bunking it for the performance anyway) 

Now I've never been late for either of these classes but today I will definitely be late to the marketing one by atleast 30-40 minutes! 

Any other person wouldn't be too bothered by this I know, but my anxiety has been acting up all morning and I don't know why and I don't know how to get rid of it either!

806,Anxiety,"I'm absolutely terrified of accidentally hurting or offending people, especially persons I'm close to. If I think I've said or done something wrong, I can't stop thinking about it and I will worry sick until I get some sort of closure that it isn't as big of a deal as I thought it was.

This is obviously also painfully true when it comes to my SO. Sometimes I would just like to have a talk with her, ask her if everything's okay, if x thing I've done or said bothered her, etc. However, I am scared that if I do try to have such conversations and it turns out that I've been stressing out for nothing, she'll think that she's giving me the impression of being offended/hurt and that she's causing me to worry this badly (which she absolutely isn't, it's a problem that's only on me, she could seem perfectly fine and happy and I'd probably still find something to stress about). Basically, I don't want her to think that she's sending bad signals and feel bad about it, because it isn't the case. 

I'm also worried that I'd annoy her by always needing reassurance that things are fine. Plus, I'm scared that my texting anxiety would show, and that I'd come off as too clingy: I often get stressed out when people don't reply to me at the rhythm they usually do, thinking I must've done something wrong even though they're probably just busy or something, and it's a pretty common trigger of my worries. 

As an example of the kind of out-of-nowhere worries that I'm talking about; we hung out today. It was fun and I think both of us had a good time. But once I got back home, I started worrying that some things I said or done might've come out wrong, although I absolutely had no bad intentions when saying/doing said thing. I can't stop thinking about it as of right now, and even though there's a part of me that's thinking that I'm just stressing out for no reason as usual, I can't help but imagine worst-case scenarios. She did tell me one time when we were discussing about my tendency to overguilt and overapologize that she would tell me if something was wrong, but I can't help but wonder ""what if this time though she didn't??"".

So yeah, basically:

‚Ä¢is a bad idea to try and have these talks with her? 

‚Ä¢if so, what other ways can I get reassurance that things are ok and that she's not hurt or offended?

‚Ä¢if not, how do i engage in such conversations without alarming her or annoying her?

818,Anxiety,"Whenever my partner wakes up, comes home or just enters the same room as me, I am on edge. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, so it is my go to explanation. But, I have considered something darker as the cause. If I am on edge about something that actually might happen, is that even anxiety? Because I never know what his mood will be. He is a gas lighter, confirmed by describing a few of our interactions to my therapist. So he can come in the room and be in an off mood (grumbling, shuffling things around necessarily, cold look) and if I call him out, he gets pretty defensive about being just fine. If I don't bother calling him out, he sometimes insists on interacting and being a bit of a twat about it. Sometimes, we both just breeze through the whole thing, no words, but I still feel the edge, his ""vibes"". 

This post definitely has a venting element to it, but I am genuinely asking for input and/or advice. We have been together for so long (10+ years), and I have often considered leaving him, but we are balls deep in this relationship and there is a lot of mess that comes with that option.

I have recently been aware that my speech will become increasingly harder to get out when I am anxious but this also happens when I'm comfortable too. The problem is that when I notice my speech becoming weird it feeds my anxiety and frustration, so it is a vicious cycle of anxiety and pain that makes me not want to speak or makes it so I anticipate that things I'm going to have to say are going to come out all fucked up.

I hate this. I fucking hate having to go out and be social and having people look at me like what the fuck is wrong with this guy, or more recently people mocking my speech problems because I am making them feel uncomfortable(plus I'm an easy target).

Five months ago, I was offered a role which offered a salary nearly double this one, in a role which would have had amazing career prospects and chances for advancement. This was a time of terrible anxiety for me though. I turned it down, my GAD convinced me it was too good for me and I would blow everything. Then, a month later I took another well paid role, which I promptly quit 3 weeks in after becoming extremely anxious again. I was qualified for both these roles, capable, and had several years of experience. But, the anxiety of change was so overwhelming and painful. I felt like I was on fire, and my life was in danger.

824,Anxiety,"sorry this is a mf novel and incoherent as hell - i can't be concise if my life depended on it and i failed english 102

hello all! i'd first like to start off by saying that although i am not clinically diagnosed with any type of anxiety disorder, i can definitely identify with many of the struggles that some of the people on this sub go through. if you look through my posts, the majority of them are related to health anxiety that has gotten fairly bad throughout the past 6 months.

i am 19, F, and still fairly dependent on my parents (still live with them, transportation, finances, insurance, etc). my anxiety about my health (or possible medical issues) has caused them quite a bit of trouble - i've made my dad take me to the ER about once a month since december, visited our PCP a few times, and now, a gastroenterologist.

every test so far that i've had has come back negative or normal. because of this, it becomes frustrating for my parents (also myself) that i can't seem to ever feel satisfied with my results. my parents deal with diagnosed medical conditions and receive therapy/medication for such conditions but are able to power through. my mom has been a stay-at-home mom for over a decade and my dad is in the military so they honestly have a lot more on their plate then i do. it may not be fair to compare situations but objectively, my parents do have more to worry about and should be worried about more things but they are able prioritize their feelings.

yesterday, i cried to my mom after saying that i feel like i couldn't breathe for the past 3 days (along with my GI symptoms) and she immediately told me to shut up and to stop bothering her. she kept telling me my test keep coming back negative and that everything i have been experiencing is all in my head. i told her that i'm afraid to die and she just said that i was overreacting. she brought up how at all of our doctor's visits she can tell that the doctors see me in a certain way in that i have the tendency to be so sure about what's wrong with me which made me even more anxious bc then it aligns with my bias that no one is taking me seriously. my dad also feels the same way.

this month, it's been so bad that i started to sleep in the same room as my younger siblings, which is something i haven't done since i was young. as you can imagine, they weren't too pleased (my sister, 13, slept in her closet even when i said she could take the bed). when i told them i wanted to be sleeping in their rooms bc of my anxiety and that i was practically begging them to let me stay, they said that they don't care and that my anxiety isn't their problem. i'm attempting to sleep in my own room tonight but i can already feel my Nightly Panic setting in.

i always thought that i could be one to manage my anxiety without extensive help but now it seems impossible. this past spring semester, i struggled so much in my classes bc instead of working on assignments i would spend all day at school and at home googling diseases and reddit threads (i clearly hate myself). more recently, i've even started watching vlogs of people who have certain diseases and their stories, thinking that i have/will end up being diagnosed in the same way they were. now that i'm out of school it's even worse bc i'm stuck at home all day.

my college offers free short-term mental health counseling for 3-5 weeks but i didn't take advantage of it until the last week of school so i couldn't get my full 5 weeks in. i talked with a counselor but i didn't touch upon my health anxiety bc i was so focused on my school stress. i recently was e-mailed by my college's case manager asking me if i wanted any additional resources outside of school. we had a phone consult yesterday and she brought up the option of finishing my 5 sessions possibly within the next few weeks on campus and more long-term therapy solutions. she asked me about my situation with my parents and i told her that it's likely that my mom won't be willing to drive me and that if i were to bring up getting therapy outside of school to them, they would not let insurance cover it. i have a friend (bless her heart) who said that she was willing to take me to the sessions if they were on fridays and i hope to god that they are bc at this point, i don't know what to do with myself.

it's really hard to believe that i'm gonna be okay or that nothing is wrong me (physically) especially when my family is so dismissive. i don't even know if i /know/ my body anymore or if the treatment plan for my GI issues i'm on is working or making things worse and treating something i didn't have in the first place (my anxiety is making me be inconsistent with it). am i making things worse? i admit i am very stubborn in my mindset so i'm constantly thinking about the ""what ifs"" and ""but this could happen"". i truly feel that i need someone else to hold me more accountable about getting better. i feel so stuck and the only thing that provides me with (fleeting) relief is seeking reassurance then i go right back to anxiety again. it's draining. i need help and i want help but i can't get it and i am really going through it oof. if my family won't take me seriously when i straight out tell them i'm scared to die, what's it gonna take?",dealing with family members who are dismissive about mental health + (health) anxiety,1561782140.0

835,Anxiety,"Hello, I won't bore you with a big story but I'll briefly describe my situation.

I'm a very relaxed person, never been particularly anxious for longer than an hour or two.

I live in Britain and went to university last September, and my boyfriend of a year and a half decided in August that he was going to come with me.

I've never really been too bothered about people not liking me, I've worried about it, but only slightly like you would about being late for class. I started going to gigs with my brother and when I confessed I was shy and didn't know how to approach people he said ""oh yeah, people like us with social anxiety get that."" I started to assume, don't ask me why, that I then had social anxiety and was a delicate flower. I feel like this fuelled me then beginning to have moderate panic attacks when I thought someone didn't like me.

Whilst this was happening, my bf and I started having issues.

One thing I should mention, is that during freshers week, I tried mdma for the first time, and had a panic on the come up, but after standing outside I felt better. I also fainted in October because I was too hot and hungry in a stuffy club.

As October and November went by, the panic attacks got worse. I had one big one because I felt lightheaded and it reminded me of the two events above. And I had a huge one, to the point where I was throwing up in my toilet, because I thought I had meningitis because I had come down with a very nasty flu.

My boyfriend leaves me a week later and I have a panic attack the next day because I think I'm gonna faint. I have my first suicidal thought during that panic attack, which is fleeting and I dismiss it. I get agoraphobia after that panic attack, and only go to my studio and back out of fear of having another panic attack. But I'm not bothered, I'll go home in about two weeks, get therapy, get better, right?

After seeing two failed therapists, the panic attacks became worse, and more frequent. I had a panic attack every day, and lay in my mums bed one night, shaking, freaking the hell out because I was so scared about what was gonna happen to me. This was December, and I'd never felt this level of fear before.

I go back to uni after 4 long, anxious weeks, and hope to get better.

For some strange reason, my agoraphobia goes away pretty quickly, by March I'm going wherever I want, whenever I want, being like ""if I panic, I panic, I'll just sit down and wait for it to go away.""

However, the other aspect of my anxiety has become stronger, and has stuck with me ever since I had a huge suicidal thought in my mums bed that night.

Every day, I have a racing heart and thoughts that I wont get better, I'm gonna be anxious forever (leading to suicidal ideation). I get thoughts that after university, I'm gonna get a mediocre job and be depressed for the rest of my life. I worry that if something goes wrong, such as my housemates excluding me, or my anxiety getting worse like it was over Christmas, I won't be able to take it and will end my life. I also get general thoughts of people not liking me.

I'm awfully sorry about how dark this post is.

Since January, I have seen a counsellor, a mental health nurse, and went to group therapy. If my problems are so mild, then how come I lay in bed feeling like this is it? Feeling like I should end it?

I'm posting in the hopes that someone could shed some light on my situation, and give me some guidance because I obviously don't want to end it, I don't want to upset my family like that.

I‚Äôve been asked to go to the doctors on Thursday to discuss the results but because I don‚Äôt understand what any of it means and google isn‚Äôt clear I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm going to die and leave my daughter and husband behind. It‚Äôs all I can think about, there‚Äôs no middle ground, I‚Äôm just dying. Every time the thought comes back to me I feel in knots and I‚Äôm overwhelmed with the worry of it all. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 
My friend suggested telling the doctor on Thursday that I feel this way and they may be able to give me something to help, but I don‚Äôt know how effective that‚Äôll be.",I‚Äôm scared,1561759246.0

849,Anxiety,"Hi everybody this is my first time posting on this sub I'm glad I found it. Feels nice knowing other people have similar experiences it still sucks though.

Sometimes when my anxiety gets the best of me and I stress over something and that's something turns out not to be the case I feel terrible. Sorry if me wording is bad here's a story to explain better 

Yesterday I was playing on Xbox and my boyfriend had gotten on. I hadn't talk to him a couple days so I figured I'd invite him to a party. He doesn't answer any of my party invites. I sent four all spread out time wise because I didn't want to be annoying.

Around the third invite I started think he's angry with me there wasn't really a reason for him to be but rational thinking had left so I thought all sorts of things. After the 4th time I started to almost cry but I tried messaging him ask me if he wanted to talk and he said yes like normal. At that point I was confused so I message back if he had gotten any of my party invites and asked if I did something.
He said no to both and told me his Xbox has been acting funny. I felt so stupid after that 1) for thinking so lowly of him but he wouldn't tell me if he was upset with me and 2) that him being mad at me was my first train of thought. He then invited me to a party and we talked like normal me not bringing up what had happened earlier.

I'm honestly not sure what to do about these kind of thoughts, I felt crummy for the rest of the night and I didn't want mine bf thinking he had that something so I didn't say anything.",That horrible feeling afterward,1561769822.0

852,Anxiety,"I believe I suffer from anxiety. But looking at posts from people commenting here and there, I realize that's not what happens to me.

Some people go on about irrational fears that occur as a result of anxiety. Example - going to sleep and thinking a bug is going to crawl in your ear, and fixating on that...

Holding your breath while crossing the street

Checking alarm clock constantly afraid it wont go off.

Another would be your airways closing up when sleeping and suffocating.

The often mention anxiety in the form of a fear of something rational or irrational, but still triggers fear.

My experience has been a little less derivative. I will all of a sudden have what I call an ""issue""

I feel elevated heart rate, almost tunnel vision type effect, real hard time focusing on anything, noises/lots of activity causes confusion and anger. A real strong urge to get the hell away from wherever I am.

A feeling of dread that i know is irrational, and i can recognize the episode for what it is, but still i have to push through it.

And 15mins later I am fine. Normal. When I am not having an issue, I can barely even comprehend the amount of fear/duress i am experiencing when I'm having an issue.

These issues can happen multiple times a day, or i can go weeks without having one.

Often they happen randomly, I could be sitting at home eating dinner with my family, and without warning BOOM.

But there are things that can often lead to an issue. Driving on a highway at high speeds, huge open areas with lots of people, are two things that ""can"" cause an issue to appear.

I say ""can"" because I have noticed a relation between these events and having an issue,but I am usually fine. I have no fear of these situations, and are in them regularly without problems.

The reason I call it anxiety, is because that's what my doctor called it.

First couple of times it happened I thought I was having a heart attack/seizure or something. So called ambulance, after many tests it wasn't heartattack/stroke/seizure.

So anxiety it is.

For a while this really put my life on hold, as I would often have to leave work midday because I couldn't handle these attacks.

Since then I have read a book called panick away, that walked a person through the process of facing such issues, and embracing them rather than trying to calm your way out of them. Mentally screaming BRING IT ON rather than internally visualizing yourself backing away from a cliff.

I have now had enough of these issues where I have recognized I am not dying, and always come out of it in 15 to 20 mins later fine. So my life can continue on, although knowing that an ""issue"" is always just around the corner, and I will fall down that hole again.

But like I have mentioned, what other people speak about with anxiety, is not what I suffer at all. I have no fear that causes it other than the feeling of terror itself.

Is this what anxiety is? It was named that years ago by my doctor and not addressed since.

I do not medicate for this at all

I am type 2 diabetic, well controlled with just metformin 2x a day. Numbers and a1c well in line.

I do also have a thyroid issue that I take synthroid for, but that has started after the issues started, and seems unaffected by.

854,Anxiety,"Anxiety is an odd duck and I find myself noticing more and more odd things it makes me do, outside of the usual ""symptoms"" or behaviors most anxious people are used to discussing.

It wasn't until recently I realized I hold my breath when I cross the street if cars are waiting for me to pass. It is completely impulsive and probably happens because I'm constantly worried about holding people up or being in the way, even in actual crosswalks.

Like above, my anxiety tries to keep me ""out of the way"" so I'm constantly walking routes that avoid the most people and traffic. I didn't realize it until I was walking with other people and felt awkward taking the busier sidewalks.

861,Anxiety,"Hi all. I've recently decided to take the plunge and go see a GP in a few days due to concerns I've had with numbness and long-term loss of sensations. I was attributing it to poor diet, anxiety, stress, and other factors, but I've cleaned myself up some and it's still persisting, so I want to go get it professionally looked at. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I believe I had a panic attack yesterday. I have OCD and hypochondria and my mind went towards some dire diagnoses (including MS, ALS, all that wonderful stuff). I thought I was dying and could feel myself plummet into despair for a good while before getting a mental grip.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that that's said, I think I'm reeling from how worked up I got. I think it's the most agonized I've been in many, many years, and maybe even ever. I'm in a fairly dark headspace right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

My arms and legs feel useless. They feel that sickening adrenaline coursing through them - they feel weak and heavy, shaky and twitchy, fuzzy and tingly. My gait is kinda off, my balance feels weird, and my legs feel like iron. My hands barely feel like they can grip my fork to eat food (although I can, I'm not actually dropping my fork, it just feels way harder than it should be...) and using my mouse at my computer is a weird experience. It constantly feels like my hand is sliding off my mouse over and over, trying to push down feels laborious.

My question is, is this normal?

865,Anxiety,"So a couple months ago, my Bf and I (21) were having issues, but he got very last minute notice that he had to move out of his current housing situation, with really no where else to go with such little notice he moved in with me and my two roommates (m&amp;f 25). We have been great since then, but the weekend we had to move him we got into a pretty large fight. For a little background info I was working Tuesday-Friday at my primary job (40 hours a week) and then on the weekends I would work at my primary job 10a-2pm and then my second job either 7pm-7am or 11pm-7am. In between shifts I had to sleep, I would fall asleep during my job if I didn't. So it just so happens that my BF only has weekends off so he needed to move his things over the weekend, I had pleaded at him to try and get a couple of his friends to help, come to that Saturday he had no help so I had to help him. I picked him up @ 2:30 on Sat and we drove 40 minutes to pick up as much that would fit in my car, we went home and unloaded the car, I tried unsuccessfully to sleep and went to work an 8 hour shift. The next morning I got up went to work at 10am and then at 2:30 picked up my bf to grab the rest of his items because yet again there was no one to help him (or so I thought). We get home and unload the car and we started arguing about something, I was TIRED, HUNGRY, and EXHAUSTED. On top of that he was having a very heavy mental episode (he has depression and Bipolar). Instead of helping me put his things into his room he decided to play LOL instead, I just wanted to cuddle so I could fall asleep, which I believe started the argument. I felt it was not fair that I didn't get comforted to sleep before my shift later that night, especially since I spent my normal nap time helping him move. I had yelled at him while he was playing because he got angry at me for pestering for cuddles, I mentioned that I just wasted my time helping him and exhausting myself when I could have been sleeping. I then stated that I was the one who showed up for him, not his friends on LOL not any of his friends. ME. I yelled ""you have shitty friends"". After a little more of fighting, he started looking for his gun which I luckily hid before he could get to it. He wanted to kill himself, he then went on a walk, no shoes or anything. Came back a little while later, put on shoes and gloves, this time I followed him out of the house, he handed me his phone and keys and said take care of everything, I am going to jump off the telephone tower. After 40 minutes of me trying to convince him not to we saw an ambulance turn into my neighborhood. I started freaking out saying lets go because I thought someone had called an ambulance to get my BF. Once we got into my neighborhood we saw that it wasn't our house, things simmered down, my female roommate talked to him and talked to me and asked for this to not happen again. I tried again unsuccessfully to sleep before my shift. I went to work, I did my shift and drove home very tired. 2 minutes from my house, I fell asleep at the wheel and kissed a curb, cracking both of my wheels on the right side of my car and popping one of the tires. I called my male roommate to come get me. I left my car and went to sleep, finally after a full 48 hours of being awake. When I woke up I had no one else to help me at the moment so I asked my bf to drive me to my car, although we had the giant fight the day before he said yes. He drove me to my car, we realized the damage and I broke down finally, bawling on the side of the road after one of the worst weekends of my life. He said you must be hungry we are getting food. The next day I called his best friend for advise because the woman he was living with insisted that I call the cops and have my BF admitted for harm/potential harm to self, I really didn't think this was a good idea for him, he would have been angry at me forever but I wanted his Best Friends opinion. The best friend explained to me that all of his friends did offer to help him, but he shrugged it off and said he didn't need the help.  After this we started really working on our relationship, he realized that he needed to go get help for his Bipolar, this was probably the cause of the constant suicidal thoughts and many other issues he deals with. We have been happy, but I found out last night that while we had that argument his friends heard every single word I said. He didn't mute it. I called his friends shitty as a generalization and most friends he was online with I actually loved, they are usually very supportive and nice. I of course started crying upon hearing this news, I would never ever want them to feel like I felt that way about these particular friends. 6 people heard me say that about them, the first one was the best friend so I texted him and explained the situation and said I never meant for any of them to be hurt by what I said and I was sincerely sorry. I then found friends 2 &amp;3 on twitter and DM'd both of them explaining in different ways how I appropriated their support for my BF and that I never meant to hurt them, one of them hasn't read it and the other read it but didn't reply. Friend 4&amp;5 I don't really know, I don't even know their last names and can't seem to find them on social media.

It takes a lot of energy for me to small-talk all day, and since I process information logically, I often can't connect with EF types.

The anxiety kicks in and tells me I need to be more outgoing and interested in other people's lives in order to feel satisfied. This could be in-person or online through social media.

884,Anxiety," I started a new job at a five star banquet yesterday and I was super stressed out. I have never had a banquet or restaurant job before. Before I started, I hadnt worked in a year. I struggle with extreme depression and anxiety. It became clear to me yesterday that I was only hired because my brother use to work at the same franchise, just a different location.   


I am constantly being told that I have to work at my my brothers performance. My brother exceeded all of my bosses expectations. I am being held to a standard that I cannot get to. I am not my brother. Every time I talk to my boss he brings up my brother, which is starting to get annoying. I feel like expectations are set on me that are not attainable. I was given somebody to train with but he kind of left me without saying anything so someone else stepped in. I did not like this persons attitude. Throughout the night I had guests ask me for containers and I would just stand there frozen, unsure of what I was supposed to do. My brain just froze as it often does during socializing. I would be asking questions throughout the night about the work trying to show my interest in the job. Then it became time to close. My trainer did not bother telling me how they closed the restaurant at all and he just seemed to snap on me at the end. He told me that I have to show him that I really want to work here and I have to be the one to ask questions. As If I was not showing any interest? I was angry. I thought to myself who do you think that you are? He went on to tell me that he took it easy on me. I got angry again just typing this.   


Then we were setting up banquet tables with utensils and they had to be done a certain way. There was a total of 5 utensils and they wanted me to move at their pace. She told me that I should have all of the utensils with me and I should put all of the utensils by the same plate at the same time. I started putting down two utensils at a time per plate and got yelled at because I wasnt being fast enough. It was clear to me my coworkers had no patience with me. She asked me why I chose to do it my way after she told me how to set up all of the utensils on one plate all at the same time. Im slow but I told her I dont know why I did it my way.   


I held in my emotions until I got home where I just ran up to my room and I just started crying. Running past my parents.   


I just dont know what Im supposed to do career wise given my diagnosis. Im slow, Im not good with people, Im irritable, I dont like real physical work and I have a hard time getting along with others.

896,Anxiety,"Imagine if you carried around a little ape on your back. He holds a game controller that‚Äôs wired directly to your brain stem and clutches at the buttons with fervor, but does nothing. The ape rides all day, watching, waiting, prepared for the moment you enter confrontation, and finally when that moment arrives you lose all control and the ape grins with vindicated delight. What happens after this you don‚Äôt remember choosing to do, but you certainly remember doing it. 

It‚Äôs taken me my entire life to figure out how to get even a modicum of control over my fight or flight instinct. When I was a child I use to get in fights all the time. I‚Äôm not trying to brag as I‚Äôm rather ashamed of this, actually, but without any experience dealing with intense emotion I tended to swing first and regret second, especially when I saw the damage I could do. As a teenager and now as an adult, I have the strength to bite my tongue and stand my ground and I‚Äôm proud to report I‚Äôve not been in a physical confrontation since 9th grade. (I‚Äôm 28 now.) 

However, the problem persists. The moment someone points a finger in my direction and so much as sneers my brain goes into overdrive trying to figure out why he is doing that and how best to destroy him when he comes over. Everything else gets shut out. It‚Äôs like someone flipped a switch and turned off all my higher brain functions and all that‚Äôs left is the ape, as if I‚Äôm facing down a saber cat and my life is at stake. When the adrenaline pumps my head begins to swim, my heart rate sky rockets, my muscles tense and I become hyper focused on this threat. All I can do is bite my tongue and stand my ground quietly for the duration, or run away. It becomes so difficult to think that I swear I could forget my own name. As you can guess I‚Äôve probably done some pretty stupid things during moments like this, and I have... things I regret immensely that still hold me back to this day. Things that have wounded and scarred my body for life, things that I spend years going over again and again and wonder why I couldn‚Äôt stop it. 

I like to think I‚Äôm a smart person, and if you‚Äôve read all the way down to here you might think so too- but I‚Äôll try not to presume too much. During moments like this I would much prefer to calmly respond verbally to confrontations in an intelligent and indisputable manner, and when my brain isn‚Äôt confusing some cussing dude smoking a cigarette at the gas pump for a real threat, I usually can.

904,Anxiety,"30 year old male. I have GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder), which I now can identify and point to triggers. For a long time I had a hard time understanding the physical symptoms (palmoplantar hyperhydrosis) and after a while I had success treating them, but the quality of my life didn't improve. This is mild anxiety (no chest pain, palpitations or panic attacks). However, it is present in all waking hours.   
By mistake, I have looked at a photograph of an acquaintance, who has a nice family and they are religious, and my gut reaction was ""Oh, it's such a shame something bad would happen to them, but there would be no guarantee that it wouldn't and if I were the father I would be the one to blame."" This reaction / thought often appears when I look at happy / wholesome families / couples. What I deducted from this is that my anxiety stems from the natural lack of control every one of us has. I can't be there all the time to defend my loved ones from a catastrophe happening. But that's not my main problem. I have been in dangerous situations and my loved ones were too, in either cases, I knew instinctively what is the right thing to do, and these situations were far less severe than I would have had imagine in my anxious mind.  
So what is this thought trying to tell me? What am I so afraid of if everything is in order? (Loving family, etc.) The possibility of it falling apart. Emotionally. Because it had happened once, in early life, I'm afraid it will happen again, but my mind projects it abstractly. It doesn't state: ""Hey, you will lose your family because you will stop loving them / your SO will stop loving you"",  but more generally ""Something bad will happen and your family will fall apart."" So I think that general anxiety is the fear of being rejected / abandoned so you will shut your emotions down in order to protect yourself. At least in my case. Others can have different reasons / sources for their anxiety. Take this as ""my two cents"".",Anxiety derived from depression / emotional detachment?,1561740902.0
905,Anxiety,"CW: I mention suicide

There‚Äôs this friend of mine I‚Äôve been crushing on for a while (I‚Äôll call her Anna), and I ended up telling her as part of a dare for a card game. That night I messaged her and apologised for saying it in front of a bunch of our friends, and see said it was ok and that she liked me but that she didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship at the moment. I took that as just trying to let me down lightly, and that she really wasn‚Äôt interested in me.

Long before all this, we‚Äôd started a running joke that we were in a relationship, but an incredibly dysfunctional where we always argued and never believed each other when we said we cared about each other. About a week before I told Anna I liked her, she kinda ended the joke by jokingly ‚Äòfriendzoning‚Äô me, but then about a week after I told her I liked her, the joke came back, and this time it felt a bit more flirty, at least with the context that I liked her.

We went to a friend‚Äôs house at the beginning of this week and we all watched Schindler‚Äôs List, and she was resting her head on me and lying on me for most of the movie. I didn‚Äôt know what to think because I‚Äôve never gone out with anyone before, nor ever really even told anyone I liked them, so I wasn‚Äôt sure if this was just a friend thing or not, but either way it made me doubt whether the initial message from her was as a flat a rejection as I had initially thought

The next day we went out with some friends and the vaguely flirty attitude continued, and the amount of physical contact between us increased a lot. This whole thing started to eat me up inside, especially after she told me during the day that I ‚Äúmake things awkward between us‚Äù but refused to tell me how. 

The next day we didn‚Äôt see each other and I spent the whole day in my house panicking and being depressed because I didn‚Äôt know what any of this meant. That was this Wednesday and it was the worst day I‚Äôve had in a long time.

Yesterday, in order to prevent a repeat of that, I went into town on my own and just walked about for a few hours. It was pretty good and I actually got myself into a really good mood and I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it all. I went home and ended up talking to another friend who had given me some advice about all this. She told me I just needed to ask Anna upfront what the deal was, and eventually convinced me to. I was pretty anxious about doing this, but it was worsened by the fact that Anna was flying to America yesterday and I didn‚Äôt want to put the pressure on her if having to deal with my stupidity whilst she should be relaxing. My friend convinced me that it wasn‚Äôt a pressure and to just do it, so I drafted a message. 

When Anna landed, we started talking about unrelated stuff, just chatting and so on. After about an hour and a half/two hours of that, and a short break in the messages, I sent her the message.

‚ÄúHey, this is probably a bit of a weird message and I‚Äôm not all that confident about sending it but I kinda have to anyway because this has been getting to me and this is too long and weird anywAY. I just need to ask what the deal is between us because I feel like I‚Äôm getting mixed messages and it‚Äôs been kinda stressing me out. I thought your initial message on that Thursday was a flat rejection, but like nicely, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what everything else afterwards has been saying. Stuff like at [friend‚Äôs house where we watched Schindler‚Äôs list]‚Äôs has made me doubt that and I kinda just need to know one way or another (and thats not to say like it made me uncomfortable or anything just I don‚Äôt really know what it means). This might just be me overthinking things and making things awkward, but what am I if not really good at doing that? :P if you need like time to think out a response to this or whatever, that‚Äôs cool, feel free to save it or screenshot it I guess? Whatever needs be. I guess this might be me making things awkward like you said on Tuesday, and I‚Äôm really sorry if it is, but this has been kinda stressing me out. Also if this looks like it‚Äôs weirdly written or whatever it‚Äôs because I drafted it like 3 times and i know I‚Äôm a nerd sorry‚Äù

This was all on snapchat so I don‚Äôt have the rest of the conversation saved, but essentially she just told me again that she liked me but didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship because she didn‚Äôt think she could commit to one without making it implode, and she was worried about all the things that could go wrong. She said she wouldn‚Äôt mind if we did go out at some point, but for the moment, she valued our friendship too much to risk it, and apologised for sending mixed messages. She said if I needed some space from her for a bit that was ok. 

I responded saying that was all okay, and that I really just needed to know what all this meant and if anything had changed. I told her it was ok to stress about things like that a bit and not worry about it. I also said that I definitely do not want to stop talking to her at all. In an attempt to lighten the mood I guess, I joked that my shaking hands made playing vibrato on my guitar easier.

She said she was also shaking about it, and she was just worried she might hurt me, amongst other things that I don‚Äôt remember well, and ended by saying she would pull back a bit if I wanted her too.

I said she‚Äôd have to try really hard to hurt me, and that I value our friendship a lot too. I said I don‚Äôt want her to pull back at all unless she wants to, in which case absolutely do.

She responded saying, paraphrased, ‚Äúok, should we go back to being friends with not physically contact then?‚Äù

Here, I think, is the fuckup, I said if that‚Äôs what she wants, but I wouldn‚Äôt turn down a hug or a head rest, and that hugs are always nice. I meant it in a friend way, and I phrased it just like that but I don‚Äôt know if it came across. Her response was just ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù. I immediately responded with an apology, I‚Äôd already worried that the hug message was weird, and so I said I was sorry if it was weird and it was ok if she needed some space too. She said ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine‚Äù and I said, ‚Äúok, I‚Äôm sorry for doing this too you‚Äù. She said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine, u/an_o_cuin, I just don‚Äôt know where my head is at atm‚Äù. I said, ‚Äúok, I hope it gets better.‚Äù She opened it but didn‚Äôt respond after that. 

I had a panic attack after this, because I was worried her short responses and my weird message meant I‚Äôd fucked our friendship up.

Meanwhile on our friend group‚Äôs group chat, a joke conversation had started about whether all animals were cute or not, and Anna had got involved whilst she had been talking to me. After we stopped talking I started to try to get involved in the conversation, but no one really responded to the things I said. A few did, but Anna didn‚Äôt directly respond to me once, and I really felt like she was ignoring me or deliberately avoiding talking to me. This terrified me, and my anxiety only got worse. After about 20 minutes she had to catch a connecting flight and so the conversation stopped. I went to bed after that because I didn‚Äôt know how else to deal with what I was feeling (which was at this point suicidal, I know how stupid that sounds but when I spiral I really fucking spiral). 

I woke up a few times during the night, and checked if I had got any messages from Anna. I hadn‚Äôt, but she had sent a few messages to the group chat. That leads us up to know. I presume she‚Äôs asleep because it‚Äôs probably only about 5-6 in the morning where she is. I‚Äôm still really scared I‚Äôve fucked out friendship up and I‚Äôm teetering on the edge of suicidal again. I don‚Äôt know what to do. This was more of a rant to get this off my chest, and I‚Äôm sorry if that breaks any rules or anything I just needed to talk about it. Thank you for reading it.

Just trying to convince myself that I don't have MS here. lol

 I had a very bad panic attack two weeks ago triggered by food choking  that left me with bruxism and tension in the digastric muscle (so, trouble swallowing and neck tension). It has since subsided a bit as I have alleviated my health anxiety,  getting several physicals to rule out thyroid problems... But last night as I got into bed I started feeling my right foot going numb and tingly. My right arm has been weak and tingly on and off since a few weeks ago as I started driving (a manual car) again after over a year of not driving, plus my posture at the computer, etc... but both sensations collided and I had a new panic attack, plus the throat tightness came rushing back. I took clonazepam and managed to sleep. My foot was not tingling in the morning but still feels a bit numb-ish. I took a long walk just now and it was working fine though.

I read a lot about anxiety and tingling sensation, but I wonder if it's usual to get it only on one side, and before or separate from an attack. And in any case, does it make sense to treat this stuff with physio even if it's anxiety-rooted?

Additionally, and this is perhaps more on account of my health anxiety, has anyone also dealt with this obsession to make sure what you have is not an autoimmune disease?

931,Anxiety,"I¬¥m writing this because i¬¥m often surprised how little conversation there is about anxiety and alcohol. From my own personal experience there is a huge link between the two and this is something that should be being discussed more. Society is soaked in alcohol. We use it at just about every opportunity, to celebrate, commiserate and everything in between, yet the many problems that it causes are seldom discussed. We prefer to keep alcohol on it¬¥s pedestal and bow down to it¬®s supposed god like radiance, than to think about the potential it has for suffering. We are taught by our friends, family and popular culture that alcohol will help us with our problems and make everything more fun. Undoubtedly drinking with friends and family can seem to be great. Booze can help you to relax into social events, jokes become funnier, conversation easier and perhaps most important of all, everyone gets on the same level and are able to connect. But are we really enjoying ourselves as much as we think, or is it an illusion?

You may argue what¬¥s wrong with an illusion that gives me happiness and good times with my friends. Surely that¬¥s a good thing? Perhaps it¬¥s healthy to drink sometimes, especially if you‚Äôve been stressed out from work, or dealing with some difficult emotions. This is a good argument and may be true for many social drinkers, however in my experience, as someone who has had to deal with anxiety all my life, alcohol is a slippery slope that tends to exacerbate the very problems that we are trying to manage. So why not just enjoy the illusion? Well it comes down to one key word and that is ¬¥acceptance¬¥. 

I cannot stress enough the importance of this word in overcoming anxiety. It is fundamental to getting your head above water and until I came across the concept one day in John Kabatt Zinn¬¥s classic ¬¥Full Catastrophe Living¬¥, my life was a full on ¬¥catastrophe¬¥ and anxiety was the one calling the shots. Without acceptance I would still be stuck in the anxiety trap and wouldn¬¥t have been able to get anywhere near where I am today. Now here¬¥s the thing, it¬¥s not a popular message, but from my own personal experiences, acceptance of anxiety is hard to achieve if you are regularly drinking alcohol. As Jon says ‚Äúunless we accept things as they are, we will try to force things to be as they are not and that can create an enormous amount of difficulty.‚Äù 

From what I have experienced with alcohol, if you are dealing with a significant anxiety problem, then you could benefit hugely from not drinking alcohol or at least, cutting right back (just my personal opinion, if this doesn‚Äôt apply to you, then please feel free to ignore). This is because alcohol is the opposite of acceptance. Instead of learning to deal with difficult emotions when they come up, when we drink we push them aside, we are in affect saying to them that they are not welcome, that we are unwilling to feel them. Unfortunately, as you may already be aware, when we are unwilling to experience difficult emotions, we end up getting more of them.

One of the major underlying reasons for my drinking was social connection. I craved it, especially as a teenager. Alcohol was a savior as i¬¥d always felt awkward and shy growing up, but after my first sip of booze, I knew I had found something to deal with that. Suddenly I could be loud and funny (at least I thought so). Overtime I became reliant on alcohol in social settings and if I didn¬¥t drink enough, then anxiety would take over. I learnt how to stay in the sweet spot and that meant I was drinking more and more. At no point was it out of control, but I didn¬¥t like how it was making me feel after the buzz wore off and over time I noticed how alcohol was not actually making me feel as happy as I thought, in fact sometimes just the opposite. Looking back I can see that by not accepting my normal uneasiness and anxiety in social situations and self medicating with alcohol, I was making the anxiety worse, but at the time I couldn¬¥t see that at all. 

I would always label myself as a ¬¥normal¬¥ drinker. I felt like I could take it or leave it, but over time I was definitely drinking more. Just this morning I walked into the communal area of my workplace to hear someone complaining about their lack of control with alcohol and how they are unable to just have just one drink. Often we talk like this as if we are surprised, but we shouldn¬¥t be. As you know, alcohol is an addictive drug that hijacks your will power and over time often leads to people drinking more. If you have anxiety, then this effect is magnified. We tend to use alcohol to manage difficult feelings, but when the buzz has worn off the anxiety comes back, often worse than it was before. This can lead to a vicious cycle of drinking more to try and stay one step ahead of our negative feelings. So what is actually going on in the brain when we drink?

David Disalvo writes in his article: ¬¥What alcohol really does to your brain¬¥ that ‚ÄúAlcohol directly affects brain chemistry by altering levels of neurotransmitters - the chemical messengers that transmit the signals throughout the body that control thought processes, behavior and emotion‚Äù. There are different types of neurotransmitters, excitatory (fun) and inhibitory (fun killer). One example of an excitatory neurotransmitter is glutamate, which normally increases activity in the brain and leads to more energy. Alcohol suppresses glutamate, which results in the brain slowing down. An example of an inhibitory neurotransmitter is GABA, which reduces your energy levels and also slows things down. The combined effect of the suppression of glutamate and higher levels of GABA is the pleasurable feeling of drinking alcohol, a reduction in anxiety and relaxation. 

This all sounds great, but do we create problems for ourselves when we artificially alter our brain chemistry. David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College, London seems to think so. In the Gauradian Newspaper he states that ‚ÄúThe body registers this new imbalance in brain chemicals and attempts to put things right. It is a little like when you eat a lot of sweets and your body goes into insulin-producing overdrive to get the blood sugar levels down to normal‚Äù. He goes on to argue that ‚ÄúWhen you are drunk, your body goes on a mission to bring Gaba levels down to normal and turn glutamate back up. When you stop drinking, therefore, you end up with unnaturally low Gaba function and a spike in glutamate ‚Äì a situation that leads to anxiety.‚Äù This it seems is why we often feel anxiety with hangovers, or even a short time after finishing drinking. In addition to this alcohol also causes a rise in the fight or flight hormone noradrenaline ‚ÄúSevere anxiety‚Äù says Nutt, ‚Äúcan be considered a surge of noradrenaline in the brain.‚Äù

As we can already see, there is a lot going on in the brain when we drink alcohol which has a direct effect on our well-being and levels of anxiety. This effect can last for days after drinking and can even help us to get stuck in rumination. But there is one more important neurotransmitter affected by alcohol that we are yet to discuss and that is dopamine. Alcohol increases the direct release of dopamine in the brains reward centre. This reward centre is affected by all pleasurable activities, such as eating, socialsing, playing sports and drinking alcohol. But by artificially raising levels of dopamine through drinking, we trick our brains into thinking we are happy, so we end up drinking more to keep that feeling going. David Dasalvo, author of the previously mentioned article, argues ‚ÄúThe effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you're altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Over time the dopamine affect diminishes and the person must consume more and more alcohol to get the good feeling.‚Äù Sadly, for many this can lead to alcohol addiction. Even moderate drinkers would be wise to exercise caution, particularly if you have issues around anxiety. 

Is alcohol getting in the way of you learning to have a better relationship with anxiety? It certainly was for me and I can honestly say, that although sometimes its hard being alcohol free, it¬¥s one of the best things i¬¥ve done to learn to deal with anxiety. The hardest part is starting and the first month is difficult, but over time it definitely gets better and amazingly, you learn that it is possible to socialize without alcohol. Why not make a positive change today? If you suspect you have a serious problem with alcohol you should seek professional help, but if you feel your drinking is under control, but could be contributing to your anxiety, why not try taking a month off and seeing how you feel?

933,Anxiety,"I have been in a rough spot for the past three years and was living in California which required me to work three freaking jobs just to pay rent, then got evicted because I was unable to pay on time because of other bills that needed attention. I had been planning on going to a shelter until my coworker insisted I stay on a cot in his tiny dining room (bless that man). I have been called relentlessly and they have even contacted someone who was formerly my roommate TWO YEARS AGO about my debt. I have answered them before but they were less than compassionate and kept insisting I plan out monthly installments despite the fact that my income has already been stretched to the point where I was having to go to food banks and relying on the kindness of co-workers to bring me lunch every workday. I'm just so freaked out and I feel like I will never make a dent in these loans. It really doesn't help that I didn't want to go to college to begin with but my grandma forced me, and she got a loan out as a co-signer somehow and insisted that I go through with this college bullshit or else she would disown me. When the loan companies started harassing her I was feeling really guilty, especially about the fact that I had gone to college and majored in something I would never use and then she revealed to me (through manipulative behavior) that she had put me through that so I would have the income eventually to ""take care of her"" (read: drive her around places and do her groceries and basically be her chauffeur/butler because I owed it to her). When I finally said no to her (she wanted me to drive her home to Manhattan and I'm terrified of the aggressive drivers there) she made me out to be the most terrible person for denying her. After a few weeks she started developing signs of dementia which made me feel even more guilty, until several months later I had been giving her sympathy calls just about every few days. She had this new, slow, listless way of speaking and insisted that she didn't know me but that I sounded like ""a beautiful granddaughter,"" which made me feel absolutely torn up about everything that had occurred up til then...

...Until she didn't hang up the phone first one day and I quietly listened to her speak to my grandfather in HER NORMAL VOICE and I can't fucking believe she staged that entire thing to make me feel guilty and now I still have these debt collectors calling me like five times a day, which is a constant reminder of how she has basically manipulated me my entire life by threatening to withhold love if I didn't cater to all her demands.

Sorry that kind of exploded but yeah I am really terrified of having my wages garnished/tax returns withheld, especially because I am not employed right now but am actively looking and I don't know how much they'd actually take out from my potential paychecks which would make it hard for me to budget the rest of my other outstanding bills.

I told other people in my group that I had some anxiety problems (when it comes to public speaking) so they let me have the very last; shortest part of the presentation (which involved literally reading out loud 4 short sentences, a quote and saying ""does anyone have any questions?) 

The 4 girls (I'm a male) I was working with went through their parts flawlessly.

When it was my turn to speak I started out pretty well but then I suddenly mispronounced a word and had to read the second sentence again...after that happened I started to stumble on EVERY SINGLE word and my hands got so shaky that I couldn't hold the script - at that point I wasn't reading but mumbling and crying at the same time and after the fourth sentence I froze up and uttered some weird noises for about 20 seconds and passed over the script to a different person who finished the presentation for me.

Back at the end of April, I woke up having a severe panic attack. Throughout my life when I‚Äôve had panic attacks, they‚Äôve left my brain feeling very numb and disconnected. After a few weeks I‚Äôd typically come back down to earth.

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn‚Äôt really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn‚Äôt.

I haven't done much psychotherapy as such, perhaps 2 or 3 sessions.

955,Anxiety,"Filed an official complaint against a dental hygienist's  inappropriate comments/ questions about my daily SNRI and use of other medications. 


I've been at this small dental clinic for 7 years, and they've frequently cycled through hygienists. This new gal made the most obnoxious comments about my medications and asked incredibly intrusive questions about lifestyle, despite my numerous attempts to evade them. She openly admitted multiple times that she doesn't believe in medications, and there were several other moments of unprofessional behavior that I was extremely affected by. 


She exclaimed ""So many medications!"" While updating my med list. I will admit that I take a number of meds right  now,  but i'm currently struggling the the symptoms of an unyet diagnosed autoimmune/autoinflammatory disease. But i've already been feeling badly about the handful of pills I take on a daily basis. 


While updating my problem list, I mentioned my GAD and she said ""have you ever tried breathing?"" I did that awkward uncomfortable chuckle one does while trying to avoid a  response, but she pressed the issue again. ""No i'm serious, have you ever tried breathing?"" 


Um. Duh. 16 years of therapy and care for my GAD means I was trying alternatives probable before she was even in school for dental hygiene. All I said  of course was that i'd struggled with the issue since I was a child. 


She said that she ""sees a naturopath and doesnt believe in medications"" which added to my growing discomfort.  Then she interrogated me about my diet. Literally asked me 4 times ""what are you eating? No really what are you eating? Do you just eat whatever without thinking about it? What are you eating then?"" I finally told her about how.my husband had recently started us on paleo diet, but then she interrogated me about how long we'd  been on it and potential trigger foods, despite my affirmation that i'd had allergy testing done in the past. (Intolerant to eggs, halibut and other white fish since we're on the subject, and according to her it's relevant information to non-medical professionals.)


More ranting but i'm tired of editing this story. We argued about how indeclined a comprehensive painful gum probing exam because my jaw /tongue was inflamed/painful just 36 hours prior due my systemic disease. She stomped off finally and got the dentist while I planned my exit, I would simply get up and walk out if they tried to force it on me. Luckily my dentist was cool and soothed me by saying we could skip it. She also ostensively disapproved of my conjectured plans to premedicate myself with pain and/or anxiety meds prior to the rescheduled procedure if I happened to be in the middle of another flare. 


It was the 3rd worst experience i've had in a dental office.
 

I would normally never say anything and would just transfer care, but I legitimately fear that she'll make other patients feel as badly as I did with her chairside manner. So, I put on my best administrative-bossbitch hat and wrote the dentist and his office manager, despite my fears of complicating our relationship.

I'm proud of myself for actually trying to stand up for those who need medicine to combat traumatic childhoods / chemical imbalances that cause significant impairment to daily life. No one should leave a dental hygiene appointment feeling persecuted for their regimen. I felt a little unjustified that I had to leave out my personal experiences in order to come off as professional,be taken more seriously and not be dismissed as oversensitive. 

I'm feeling anxiety about the issues she made me talk about, her reaction/demeanor during the discussion, and my fear of being written off as just a 'whiner.' However, no one should feel as negatively as I have for the 24hrs since my appointment. 

Hopefully I did a good enough job at explaining my perspective, offering constructive feedback and remaining as professional as possible. I lowkey hope that this will be an eye-opening experience for her.

957,Anxiety,"I'm 29, I've suffered since my teens but only really admitted it to myself and put the anxiety label on it 4 years ago. For the most part I'd say it's been mild to moderate, suffering wise. But over the last year its been ramping up and have regularly felt myself increasingly close to the edge of full blown panic attacks. Since I admitted it I've taken big steps toward improving my life. I quit smoking, started exercising more, began meditating, sorted out my diet, started sleeping better, and for the past year I've been self medicating with St John's wort and sometimes cbd, among lots of other small things, too many to list here. Physically I'm a much healthier person than I was 4 years ago, but the anxiety seems to be getting worse. I've never told my doctor about it. Im from a big family and my older siblings and mum have all suffered terribly with anxiety, depression, OCD, one of my sisters literally could not leave her house for 18 months. So safe to say it runs in my family, I grew up watching them medicate for years with little success, so I think it's understandable I've put off the thoughts of medication til now, it's not that I wouldnt ever take it, but I have a bit more of a ""spiritual"" mindset than my family and have been trying to exhaust every possible avenue before taking medications that, in my siblings cases, have little/no effect, or could even make things worse.

TLDR;
So ultimately my question is, has anyone here had much success with anxiety medications? How long do you take them for, is it indefinitely? Do you stop taking them once you start to feel better?

So I've been a mess lately, especially in the last couple weeks. I lost my appetite, desire to do things, so over a week ago, I went to the doctor's and she recommended me to go off Lexapro (which I was taking 20mg) and start Cymbalta. 

I have emetophobia (fear of vomiting/nausea), so the thought of going off one antidepressant and starting another made me feel anxious of withdrawals/side effects. 

For a week, I cut my Lexapro in half (10mg/day) and started taking 30 mg Cymbalta. I continued that for a week, and for the last 48 hours, I have taken no Lexapro (as per her instructions), and 60 mg Cymbalta. 

Been feeling the worst for the past couple weeks, but woke up and for the first time in a while, things don't seem to bad. I don't seem to be experiencing any withdrawal effects from the Lexapro, and the Cymbalta doesn't seem to be causing any weird side effects. I imagine I will feel better in another 6 days, when the Lexapro is completely out of my system and my body should be totally adjusted to the Cymbalta. 

A week ago, things seemed hopeless. Now I am thinking things won't be too bad. I'm a week free of xanax (was taking every day last week), and haven't had a panic attack since. 

Nausea levels decreasing, appetite improving, sleeping better, and getting more work done.

Lately I‚Äôve been suffering badly from intrusive thoughts. It seems like every couple of months, my intrusive thoughts will flare up again, and become awful. Last summer, I had intrusive thoughts about an incestual relationship with my cousin who I am closest to. When I was 10, I suffered from health-related intrusive thoughts that made me mentally break down multiple times. This was my first time suffering from intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors due to such thoughts and anxieties.

Now I am suffering from intrusive thoughts again, and they are mostly triggered by seeing scary things on the news, looking at something innocent, or going outside. I remember, for no reason, the day before I met my boyfriend, I saw something on the news about a young girl getting raped, and thus I had irrational and intrusive thoughts about being raped up until we met.

Whenever I go out, I always picture a bystander taking out a gun and shooting me. I get so scared and uneasy outside due to this. I avoid looking at scary news stories because it triggers my thoughts about being harmed by others or harming others myself. I can‚Äôt even look at small animals or babies because I get graphic intrusive thoughts about harming them.

It is honestly debilitating. Sometimes I‚Äôm unsure if I actually fear others or if I just fear my irrational and intrusive thoughts. I need advice on how to deal with these, what I can do to lessen them, and what type of therapy may help.

966,Anxiety,"A few months ago I posted about having too much anxiety to sleep after accidentally seeing a dead person in my job of cleaning at a funeral home (I work for several cleaning agencies and this was one of my postings. Woo, multi-shit-job student life!) To cut a long story short, I saw several dead people there, but that one I saw in a fully lit room. When I started that job I was to understand that seeing the deceased had absolutely no part of my job, I was just a cleaner.

After seeing a few more people I quit after having a major anxiety attack because someone left a door half-open which could literally mean anything about that room. Empty? Occupied? Who knew? It was a gamble and I wasn‚Äôt willing to risk it any longer. 

A few months later I‚Äôve been getting recurring nightmares about the deceased. In these nightmares I don‚Äôt even see them like 95% of the time, but for some reason my home usually becomes attached to a funeral home and people like to leave doors open. And the smell of the mortuary that I can still smell in my dreams. Fuck, even the smell of the wood polish I used to use there. To put it into perspective of how much that place still haunts me, I used to really love the smell of that wood polish so I went to use it on another job, and the smell triggered a minor anxiety attack because I associate it with polishing the tables back in the home, which means potential dead people. Even the coffin emoji makes me uncomfortable now. Coffins in general make me very uncomfortable. 

I‚Äôve essentially become scared of the dark again too. Or more accurately, I‚Äôm scared of rectangular objects in the dark. It‚Äôs nearly 2am here and it‚Äôs very dark and I need to sit up and put my light on but I kind of can‚Äôt right now because my desk is opposite my bed and although there‚Äôs precisely 0% chance of it being a coffin, even less, probably, but the voice in the back of my mind is screaming that it might be one. I‚Äôll get there in time. But hey, this is the joy of waking up a sweaty mess from another fucking anxiety-inducing dream.

I'm doing pretty bad and it was clear to people around me that I had to see one. Now mental healthcare is really bad in my country and a lot of people went trough a lot of efford to finally get me a therapist.
I went a total of three times. The woman was very nice but it was not at all working for me, I felt like I was treated like a child and not taken seriously. She gave me some things to do at home like write down 3 things I liked about my day and she made me plan out my entire week. 
My anxiety was too bad to talk to her about it or ask her for a different approach so after the 3rd time I just sent her an E-mail saying it wasn't working for me and I wanted to stop the treatment. She E-mailed me back saying she would like anoter appointment to talk about it. That was the last thing I wanted so I declined, (again per mail) and she sent me a pretty salty E-mail back.

I want to try to give away as little information as I possibly can, in case that anyone somehow figures out who I am in this post.

So, I attend a college, and I am part of this class (don't want to mention it). In this class, you spend a lot of time with 30-40 people. One of them was really friendly at first. But after that, I had a feeling in my gut that they didn't like me and hated me. It must be true, because this person constantly ""joked"" about stabbing me. Now I am afraid to go back to this class next semester because of him.

The first instance came after me and a few other students grabbed lunch together. I said something insensitive to him on accident, not realizing the way I came across. His response was that he will stab me, take my wallet, and donate the money to the poor.

Another time grabbing lunch, I made a remark to the other students about how we are basically a family at this point, and I heard one of the other students say ""we don't stab our family"". I know that he was talking about me.

This changed into actually pretending to stab me, and I am not sure if this can count as assault. I didn't take this as seriously as I should have. While we were side by side at one point, he pushed his hand into my side, closed-fist.

There was another time not long after that incident where he walked straight up to me grinning from ear to ear, and he pushed his hand into my stomach and back out, I asked him why he kept doing this, and he just stood there smiling, not saying anything.

Another time, he straight up told me that ""I was hoping that you'd die from that (not going to mention it here)"".

Through the grapevine, I know that this guy has some issues in his private life. I kind of shrugged it off as him joking, but upon recent reflection, I realize that this might be more serious than I realize. What if he actually does stab me? I unfortunately didn't get any audio/video footage of him doing these things. What should I do?

I just FEEL I‚Äôm going to have a seizure, even if I don‚Äôt know if it is one of course. Confused and panicky as hell, I even get derealisation sometimes 
2. I‚Äôve been dealing with muscle twitching since I was 13 (I‚Äôm 20 now) they are called ‚Äúfasciculation‚Äù. They are apparently not the same kind of muscles movement you would get from a seizure but who knows, maybe there is a correlation of some kind 
Here are the reasons why I might not have epilepsy: 
1. I‚Äôm an anxious person. I think we kinda established that. I suffer from emetophobia and anxiety attacks related to this thing. Maybe there‚Äôs a deep-rooted fear of losing control. Sooo, is it possible that the feeling of ‚Äúgod I‚Äôm going to have a seizure I just sense it‚Äù is actually just an anxious thought? And I‚Äôm just experiencing a panic attack from fear of having a seizure? 
2. Muscle twitching, among other causes (yes I am paranoid of these too but that‚Äôs a different funny story), can be caused by, you guessed it, anxiety. 
3. I never had a brain injury, and, as far as I know, I don‚Äôt think epilepsy runs in my family. I don‚Äôt get any other symptoms of epilepsy, apart from the ones I have described above.

I don‚Äôt know if my dreams directly correlate with the panic attacks, but I‚Äôm not sure what else it could be. Starting my day with a panic attack is awful because it causes me to be anxious all day which makes me not want to eat.

994,Anxiety,"Hello, I've been dealing with anxiety most of my life, I have absolutely no idea why. None. Sometimes it goes away for periods of days or sometimes weeks, but always returns. I don't even have anything in my life to stress me out so much, I have no idea why anxiety attacks and the thought of having an attack is so debilitating to me. 
Lately its been a bit worse then usual. I feel a bit of disconnect from friends or family because they don't really understand. 
""Just relax?"" 
""What's stressing you out? Just fix it."". 
""Just don't think about it.""
I been roaming reddit a few months and it finally dawned on me to check to see if there is any subreddits with others who might be the same, scrolling around make me feel a bit better knowing I'm not alone, but also makes me incredibly sad to see that others feel this same dread. 
I typically try to distract myself so I can temporarily relax and not think about my own breathing (the more I hope I don't hyperventilate, the more I eventually do.) But it's so hard. To sleep, to do small chores, to go to work, to eat, to do anything where you can't completely immerse youself into mentally to distract youself. 
I know it's a crazy thought, but sometimes i wish something was physically/medically wrong with me, so I could have an answer as to why I feel this. So I could have a treatment plan that I know will forsure help. 
It's such a helpless feeling knowing it's not something you can see or touch or have someone else just fix you, it's not a condition you can just take care of and be done and over with forever. That it's something going on in your head, I feel completely responsible and helpless sometimes..

Sorry for the rant, I'm obviously new to this subreddit and I've been very emotional lately, so I'm looking forward to relating to most of you here, hopefully we can all help eachother and discover things within ourselves for a better tomorrow. 
Thank you.",First time finding this subreddit.. glad to know I'm not alone but also very sad to see so many feel this horrible emotion too.,1561692660.0
995,Anxiety,"I started a job a few weeks ago. I didn't get much specific instruction but a part of it is data entry and it is a lot like a job I did before. I am also working in shipping and I made a few mistakes but I wasn't yelled at or anything. I did get called out for one of them in a team meeting which was sort of uncomfortable. I am really really trying my best and have been told I was doing fine and even told them that if I was doing something wrong to please let me know right away. Today I didn't do shipping which was sort of odd but it was nice since I really am data entry. I just was at my computer plugging away at work. My boss came by my desk to say goodbye for the day and shook my hand and then said he had some stuff to go over with me tomorrow or Monday and asked if that works for me. I really haven't asked a ton of questions in the work as I'm pretty firmiliar with it and I have asked when I was not sure. The whole interaction was really weird and I can't help but think that I am really fucking up or that I am doing a bad job and they have not been saying anything.

996,Anxiety,"Hey everyone,

I've been struggling with anxiety for a couple years now and I'm really worried right now because I will soon be talking  more about it with my mom and doctor. My physician acknowledged that i have issues with anxiety, but when it was brought up I was still pretty young and did not completely understand what I could say or do to express my opinion on the way it was dealt with. So my doctor sent me home with some breathing exercises and gave my mom instructions on how to help with it a bit. It has gotten slightly better over the years (its been almost three now) with some help from my mom, but I still think that it could be greatly improved. My mom doesn't know the extent of it because I don't quite feel comfortable sharing it with her and haven't in the past. All she has seen is the general decrease in anxiety attacks. Although that is some improvement, with that decrease has come in increase in smaller less explosive attacks that generally do not cause me physically symptoms as my earlier attacks did but happen more frequently and over smaller things. In the past I did not feel comfortable sharing the things that i had worried about with them because I was pretty young and was not sure how to go about it I guess, Now that I see others, in friends, family and online getting treatment and speaking up about their issues it has encouraged me to finally talk about the full extent of my anxiety problems and push for getting help with it. Has this happened with anyone else? What can I do to make it less awkward and to make sure my voice is heard? I don't know but I'm really freaking out about talking about this with adults and I can't tell if its truly gotten better or if its just evolved into something new. Has anyone been in this situation that can share their advice with me? My doctor and mom are very supportive but I am still very nervous to talk about these kinds of things to them.

Thanks

3022,Anxiety,"I have realized my anxiety is so deeply rooted in my need for control and taking medication has always been a huge trigger for me because it makes me feel out of control.
