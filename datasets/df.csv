0,1,"We know that September 10 was World Suicide Prevention Day. And, we're all for activism. But not here, please and thank you. It takes focus away from our OPs in need of support and understanding.  Reminder: NO ACTIVISM is allowed here at any time."
1,1,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.  

Thanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.   Regular Check-In Post"
2,1,I’m going to the movies. I’m so nervous… I’m willingly leaving my house for the first time in over 6 months
3,1,Now i can save so i can get myself out of this shitty place i'm in rn. Wish me luck i finally got a job
4,1,I always do this. I’ll stay up until the wee hours of the morning playing video games or watching YouTube or Netflix even when I’m bored of it just so I don’t have to lay there in bed completely vulnerable to the depressing thoughts that will inevitably come. Does anyone else stay up super late to avoid being alone with their thoughts trying to fall asleep?
5,1,"its a little thing, but it’s helped my head a little bit. I have a hard time motivating myself to do pretty much anything, normally I freeze up pretty badly and give up and I spend a lot of my time just laying in bed or sleeping. but today and yesterday I was able to get myself to walk my dog across the field from my house and it felt really nice. I’ve started talking my dog out for walks in the mornings"
6,1,"I'll be 27 in a couple months. I was thinking back to when I was a kid and got sad. I'll never have that naivety and sense of wonder ever again. It left me when I was a teenager and hasn't come back.

I've seen and been through too much, and it turned me into the cold, jaded husk that I am today. I've tried therapy and meds, but I can't seem to regain my enthusiasm for life. It's all so frustrating, boring and painful. Just uninteresting.

Everything feels like a lie. I can't trust anything or anyone. You get shit on by people so many times over the years and it makes you lose faith in humanity. My friend recently sent me a video of a talented guitarist playing a song, and all I could think about is what editing did he use to make it sound better. My immediate assumption, without even realizing it, was that his talent was a lie. I couldn't just enjoy the song for what it was.

So this is who I am now. As a person. As hard as I try to make good memories, the bad ones and the hard lessons learned are still there. How can you ever be happy knowing the world and people in general don't give a flying shit about you? Knowing that people will smile and lie to your face?

The answer is, you won't. You know what the world is now. You can't go back. This place just sucks for some of us, and no amount of therapy or medication can take that realization away. It's a dog eat dog world, and those of us not built for it will suffer. It's just nature. I think once you reach a certain age, it's too late."
7,1,What the fuck did I do to deserve this What the fuck is this
8,1,"I had an interview for a pretty prestigious job from a pretty affluent medical company, and honestly the interview couldn’t have gone any better, I absolutely smoked it, and I feel better honestly, I have a lot of issues still obviously but I’m pretty proud that I could do this, it’s been awhile since I’ve been able to conduct myself in such a professional manner, I still look good in a suit too, I suppose it’s the little things init. Even if I don’t hear back it’ll be due to over qualified people applying and I can deal with that, the job market at the moment is pretty saturated. I feel better than I did yesterday and that’s a start. I absolutely smashed my interview today"
9,1,"The last few days I felt on top of the world, had boundless energy, felt my depression was completely cured. Was so happy, life was so beautiful, every thing was so beautiful. I was planning days out, chatting to people more than I ever do, making jokes, laughing. Felt a deep sense of calm and connection with the universe. 
Now I'm lying in bed tired and miserable because I painted my shed door and made a mess of it so I'm obviously a worthless human being. The idea of following through with any of those plans I made fills me with dread. 

I wish the happiness would actually last. Two days ago I was feeling amazing, the best I ever have and now I am miserable and want to die. Wtf brain."
10,1,"*Both* my psychiatrist and my therapist said this to me upon meeting me. 

I don't know why, but it really rubs me the wrong way. These are mental health professionals, shouldn't they know better? It makes me wonder how many people don't seek help because they don't ""fit the description."" 

Idk why I posted this, it just happened to me last week with a new psychiatrist and I've been ruminating on it.

ETA: definitely was clinically depressed, for the record. My dog saved my life more than once this past winter/spring before I saw a doctor, because I couldn't leave him behind. I just think it's wild a mental health professional wouldn't be aware of functional deoression. ""Well, I know you're not depressed, you're so smiley and pleasant!"""
11,1,"I've been purposely doing things that cause me to have panic attacks and meltdowns to get others' attention,

specifically people who I have quite dysfunctional relationships with, I only am cared for and treated well when I become psychotic and try to mutilate myself, I feel so much worthless because of that I hurt myself to get love and attention"
12,1,"Back in the good old days of severe depression when I wasn’t *so* depressed that my dick didn’t even work, jacking off was a good addition to my day. Not great, just good.

An orgasm has roughly the same physiological effect on our reward centers as eating 2 cheeseburgers. That’s obviously not a consistent number but, you get the point. Who doesn’t love a cheeseburger.

But now? It’s just. I’m too sad to even be horny. Too sad to think sexually. Too grim and glum to even *want* to think sexually. Nothing helps.

I’m stuck in a disgusting toxic environment with no fucking out. I can’t get out yet. I can’t get out next month or in 3 months or in 6. Trapped until further notice. 

And my brain knows it. My depression knows it. I’m fucking miserable absolutely constantly. 

I don’t want to wake up anymore Jacking off used to help but now I can barely get it up..."
13,1,"Just turned 24, trying to get my life in shape. I’ve made some bad decisions in the past, namely dropping out of high school (guidance counselor told me to leave, shouldn’t have listened) and dropping out of college when I found out I was in the wrong program. I wanted to pursue my dream job of working as a game developer. Turns out I was working towards a certificate to do tech support. I’ve had many short lived jobs. Left them all. Finally got a good job working for Samsung. They fired me on week 2 because I got the flu. Tried getting a job at a plant through a temp agency. Passed out from the heat and begged them not to fire me when they found out. Almost passed out again a few days later and walked off the job. I’m so sad. 

I’m living in a camper behind my aunt but she’s psychotic, the other day she locked my girlfriend and I in the back yard and told me I could no longer open the gate because a few months ago I forgot to lock it. That could’ve made my girlfriend late for work. The camper was made in 1995, it’s literally as old as I am, and it’s falling apart and I’m so scared she’s going to make me pay for the damages to it even though I haven’t done anything to cause it. I have however neglected to tell her about the extent of the water damage however (dry rot in walls, sinking ceiling in one room) because, well, I’m scared of her. My mom proposed the idea of her financing a camper to put in her yard that I can live in. But I’m scared of that. My dad still lives there, and he was extremely abusive growing up. I’m scared if I move back with my parents I might get into a hole where it’s hard to leave. I’m scared of what people will think of me. I’m already the black sheep of the family. Both of my sisters are succeeding. One is moved out with a husband and two kids. The other is dating a guy who is working towards working for a certain government agency. I think. I’ve never had a conversation with him. He doesn’t acknowledge me. I know what people think of me but I never wanted this for myself. 

I just want to go back to school but I have no money. I already have a student loan that won’t be paid off for six years. I don’t have a car. I need a car for school. To get a car I need a job that I can keep that won’t cut my hours like a few jobs that I’ve had. What if I get a car then lose my job like every other job I’ve lost? How will I pay for my car? What if I get that far then I get the courage to go back to school and then my employer isn’t willing to work with my school schedule so they let me go or cut my hours so low I can’t support myself and lose the car?

I’m so scared of everything. I don’t know what the right thing to do is. I just want to do the right thing. I just want to be good. I just want to make games that make people happy. Feeling hopeless and trapped"
14,1,"At night sometimes I just want to leave my house and keep walking aimlessly. I want to get on the bus and ride it until it stops. I don't know where, I just want to feel free and in control again. Does anyone else just have the urge to leave?"
15,1,"My best friend recently told me how she rlly felt about me, and she thought I act like I care about people but only fake it to get the drama at our school, and that I'm also a selfish narcissist. She used to also call me a nerd and a dork etc etc. Even though she kept telling me she was kidding, about me being a nerd, it had to come from somewhere, right? 

Then recently another girl (the classic popular, smart, pretty, kinda girl) I've been talking to more (she told me she likes me, and I told her the same), started telling others about me. And she says that they think that I'm ""nice"" or ""cool"" or ""sweet"", but I can't help but think that she's lying. And when she says that I'm cute or funny or cool, I can't help but think how much she's rlly trying to not hurt my feelings. Sometimes I don't know why she likes me, and it feels like she just pities me. I hate it. Do you ever have such low self esteem that you think other people lie when they compliment you?"
16,1,"This place between my ears is a bad neighborhood, I should not be there alone. When you break your arm everyone wants to sign your cast. But when your brain is sick everyone wants to run away"
17,1,"Usually old songs from your childhood/teen years, it proper bums me out Does anyone feel really depressed when they get nostalgic?"
18,1,"Like, are we living on the same planet? It just doesn’t make sense to me. It baffles me that some people genuinely enjoy life and are happy on a regular basis"
19,1,"Whenever I get comfortable enough around somebody to talk to them about my depression, it ends up screwing everything up. Since they then know about it, slowly I stop pretending to be happy around them, since they already know about it and I usually can't find the energy to do it if i don't feel like NEED to do it. That then screws everything up between me and that person because it makes me no fun to be around and I just end up sucking the fun out of anything.

This just ends up in me shutting up about it, and I feel like I'm going insane not being able to talk about it at all. At least until there is another person I can be like an emotional vampire too and start the cycle again. I fucking hate this. Does anybody else ever ruin their friendships by talking about your depression?"
20,1,"Gift

-

I have been given a gift

And I have been told I must be thankful

So I stretch my lips into a smile

And show everyone that I am happy.

-

I am not allowed to throw it away

That would be rude, I’m told.

But that’s alright.

I think I’d like to keep it

For a little while longer at least.

-

Maybe someone will take it from me

Or I’ll make a mistake and break it

Maybe by then

I will have learned to truly mourn my loss. 

-

Everyone else smiles for their gift

And I suppose

I must also enjoy mine. 

Maybe I simply don’t understand it yet. 

Maybe I’ll learn to love it one day.

Poetry is a huge help/outlet when my emotions become more than I can handle. Usually they’re very angsty but I wanted to share this one, because I like to look back on it and see that i can still have a shred of hope in my darkest times. It’s also nice to see how far I’ve come when I reread my darkest thoughts, but when I’m in a better mental place. Reminds me that it’s never permanent. Hope anyone who sees this gives poetry/journaling a try if you haven’t already. It’s one of the only reasons I’m still here today. Stay strong, folks. One of my rare, more hopeful poems about my depression and suicidal ideation."
21,1,"ok so I recently started getting into cooking (since I'm almost 23 and I can't cook rice to save my life) and holy shit dude. I can make a bomb ass fettucine alfredo. 

not leaving my house and reading self help books does bring out the best you having depression has made me realise Im a damn good cook"
22,1,"I've tried, I really did but it's no use, my life is already ruined beyond fixing. I've got no money, no friends, soon no home, I'm alao disabled and my relationship with my family is also terrible. Nice. I'm officially giving up"
23,1,"Even tho now I've seen a psychiatrist I still caught myself thinking ""why don't you just start being normal"". Like getting up on time and eating food and doing normal work isn't that hard why the hell can't I do it!!? I would hate myself forever if I'm jsut destroying my life because I'm living with a victim mindset. Does anyone feel like they're just overreacting and destroying their life 'intentionally'"
24,1,"I feel for everyone in this sub.  I survive my depression each and every day.  I want all of you to survive as well.  Depression is like a monster, by which I mean it’s intimidating to deal with because dealing with our monsters means having to deal with fear.  Fear is conquerable, however.

I’m not limiting anyone’s feelings to nothing but fear.  We all have a wide spectrum of emotions.  What I’m saying is that we are goddamn warriors.  We face these monstrosities every damn day.  And yet we survive.

If the hardest part of the day is getting out of bed, then it’s all uphill from there.

You got this!  We got this! I Hope This Reaches Some Of You"
25,1,"Depression runs in my family, my great grandmother was treatment resistant. She had to live her whole life through depression and ended up dying at an early age (due to health related issue). I've been suffering for over a year now and I am convinced that I am treatment resistant. I've failed several antidepressant medications. Infact, my major depression, memory, and attention span have just gotten worse. 

I was excited to hear a year ago when Ketamine was being used as a rapid acting antidepressant. However, the issue I have with this is the amount you pay vs the actual cost of Ketamine. Depending on where you live and where you go, the price could be hundreds to thousands of dollars.

This is where the chicken and the egg problem come in. I can't afford this shit, because I'm unable to work.

I do get that research money needs to be made but let's consider the fact that Ketamine cost around $10-$25 (also factoring in where you live.)

Does anyone else agree?

Correct me if I am wrong about anything. Ketamine treatment price is bullshit"
26,1,"Now I wouldn't say my dog cured my depression,  but the way he gets me out everyday for exercise has helped me immensely.  It's also an amazing feeling to have a constant companion that gives you unconditional love.  Dogs are the best. Getting a dog was the best idea I've had in years."
27,1,"Anyone wish they could just reset their lives? Like go to character creation and add or remove traits you desire. Alter your body as you see fit. Or even keep the memories of your life before resetting. 

I really wish there was one. Reset Button"
28,1,"My former classmates that I know of, all have degrees, girlfriends, I see them constantly share photos from their travel trips, they are basically happy adults. When it comes to me, I never step outside the house except for playing a sport some times a week, I don't have any friends, never had a girlfriend and am extremely childish. My parents upkeep me. ( I've dropped out of university twice, I did't socialise with anyone at the uni and I guess it exhausted me mentally and I fell out. Apart from that, I was doing practically nothing that would improve my life prospects) 

I'm not going to go but figured I would ask if maybe someone had similar experience What will I find at a 5 year school reunion as a loser?"
29,1,"Do any of you folks here feel like a fraud and totally undeserving of the privileges and friends you have around you? I feel like I have lot going on my life. I have a ton of hobbies, I have my own place, I have several different groups of friends and people that I surround myself with but somehow I still feel isolated from them and completely unworthy of them. 

I feel like a fraud to them. Like me being nice is me being fake and when they give me praise I feel like they would all scorn me if they knew what kind of person I was.

I feel like I don’t deserve the nice things that I have. I feel like it is undefining to me and that I should just give it all away.

I haven’t been enjoying my hobbies for the past week... I just don’t feel like I have a right to enjoyment of anything anymore.

What I have been thinking of a lot is my ex. I was with this person for 5 years and in two months it’ll have been a year since we split. I can’t help but keep thinking how horrible I treated this person in the end. I try to focus on how far I’ve come since the split but I feel stagnant like I’ve really got nothing to show for it.

I feel like if everyone knew my past sins, they would all unanimously reject me.

Do any of you feel this way? To the unworthy..."
30,1,"To be 21, married and have major depression disorder is definitely something. To feel like you have a family you didn't have when you were younger; To finally be rid of the negativity and toxicity in my life but yet.. Depression is always there. Depression is always there glaring at me, waiting for me to make my next mistake and then it can set in; Even if it's just for a little while.

Depression welcomes you with naps during the day, but then comes insomnia. Depression welcomes you with staying in bed all day, but then that day passes you by and you feel like you wasted everything; Time to spend with my husband, time to spend playing with my dogs, and time spending trying to leave my house and be productive. That time is just gone. 

I feel as if none of this matters and we will all be dead within 30 years due to climate change, so why would I stick around for that? Everything is left up to chance and nothing matters because in the grand scheme, we will all die anyways and only to be forgotten to time. In a 150 years, no one will remember me because I'll be gone;no one will remember my husband or my dogs because they will also die. Life just ends, why can't I make that choice to end it when I want?

I stick around only for my dogs and husband, I wouldn't be able to do that to them. My dogs stare at me whenever I try to hurt myself and I stop because if I die, they wont understand and they will think I just left them.

But I don't know how to keep going. Does anyone know what its like to have everything in your life be great, but you still like you wanna die anyway?"
31,1,"my mother was drunk and told me she didnt want to see me, she said she wanted to go back home and leave forever so she didnt have to see me i already knew this but it still hurt its my fault that she cant leave i just want to hurry up and grow up so i can move out and she can leave the family today my mother told me she didnt want to see me"
32,1,"The past week or so, I've been in a depressive hole. I'm still eating right, exercising, attempting to get enough sleep, but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I don't even know what I really want to do. I have a number to try to set myself up with a therapist (my most recent one no longer practices) but I can't bring myself to make the call. I don't want to *be* anymore. I don't even know what I want from posting here. I guess I just need to put it out into the world. Maybe it'll stop rattling about in my head. I want to reach out but I don't know how"
33,1,"Once situations change, friendships are never the same again. Even if I make an effort to stay in touch with old friends it just feels like a chore, and I don’t want to make new friends because I find something wrong in everyone I meet. Just feeling incredibly alone and wanted to rant, sorry Dying friendships"
34,1,"Its so hard, I need support :C I must choose my study degree in three days while I'm depressed and I'm definitely not in state of doing anything..."
35,1,I feel worthless because I'm not doing anything and I don't want to do anything because I feel worthless Has anyone managed to break the cycle of feeling worthless?
36,1,"It makes me feel terrible but I'm too depressed to go out, let alone eat. I hardly even talk to my family and I try and avoid them. Lying in bed or playing video games all day is my summer routine summed up"
37,1,"Basically I was going to hang myself but I couldn't find anywhere high enough, so I won't go into details but basically I tried to strangle myself with the rope on my bed. I tried a few times but each time I stopped myself when I started to feel dizzy and was about to pass out. Eventually I gave up all together. 

The only reason I ask is because my doctor keeps referring to it as a suicide attempt and I don't see it that way. I didn't get to a drastic point and have to be saved, I stopped myself before anything happened. What counts as a suicide attempt?"
38,1,"I don't know who to talk to right now. It feels like everyone has grown tired of me not being well. I live in a smallish place. I worry my family too much when I talk to them about how I feel. I'm 27 and rely on my family to pay for big payments like power and car rego because I can't get and hold a job. I can't move in with them as they are split and the houses are full with other family members. I can't afford this place but it's the cheapest and best option available. I have no qualifications, I have mainly had hospitality experience and since becoming depressed again it's been so incredibly difficult to get a job and hold it. They see through my facade, more I can't hold it for long. It all resurfaced after I started a relationship and of the first year she was gone 10 months travelling. During that time instead of being a healthy human I fell into the darkness. And when she returned I wasn't the same happy person and the relationship fell apart. We still talk in hopes of things working but I don't even know if I can keep living here. I need money to live and I can't find enough work. She's the only person I feel I can talk to right now but even she is tired of listening to me being negative all the time. I wish my brain worked differently. Thank you. I need to vent"
39,1,"Everybody who just says don't kill yourself and says nothing else has no idea. Everybody thinks it's so easy to just not do it but have no idea what that actually means. It means choosing absolute fucking agony, fighting literally every second to keep going. Nobody ever says here's a way to make the pain more tolerable so you'll want to kill yourself less. They just say don't do it.



It's like ok, yeah, I have a choice between intolerable misery or something that would end it and you tell me to just choose the former. Not realizing that means ACTIVELY choosing to suffer Everyone just says don't kill yourself but doesn't propose any way to lessen the pain"
40,1,"I'm finally starting to accept that I'm not ever going to not be alone.

I haven't really ever had friends besides the ones that come and go online, and have always been pretty alone.

I use to think that i was fine with just myself, and that being alone wasn't even a bad thing, but at some point It turned into self hatred and loneliness.

Maybe I'm alone because of me, not because of the people that decided they didn't want to be my friend at all, but because i did something.

After trying super hard to find even just one person to connect with, and being ghosted countless times, and not finding literally anyone not online, I've gotten nowhere and have been hurt far more trying to find people.

I'm finally starting to realize that I'm not going to find anyone, that I'm stuck being alone forever.

The few people I talk to online won't be around forever, just like the people I use to talk to before them...

Nothing is going to change, nobody is going to appear and make things better.

This is reality and my reality is that i have always been alone, i always will be alone, and i will die alone.
I'm finally beginning to accept it, and i don't want to. Finally accepting my place in life."
41,1,"So yeah, before going to my dad's place I put the letter in our mailbox.
I have tried so many times to tell her how I feel, but the words never came out. I feel a bit bad about it, but also really proud.
It's too late to regret it, I just have to go towards now.
I'm wondering if other people used a method like that to tell what's going on inside, and I would like to hear other ways.
Have a great day I just sent the letter to my mom where I tell her how I feel, has anyone else done that?"
42,1,"Sorry for the long post to start with, I normally don't get any comments when I make these sort of posts but I will try again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am 24 from the UK, without going into too much detail and boring you...

&amp;#x200B;

I was angry at a young age due to my brothers having an illness and I had voices in my head telling me they were going to die, I had thoughts that I wanted them to die when I didn't actually want that so it messed me up, I misbehaved in school for whatever reason, be it to escape or for attention, I missed out on a proper education because of this. I was just angry at life. I was sexually abused at some point around 10 and probably happened on and off for a few years which I just put to the back on my mind and didn't do anything about it, I got bullied through high school and at the age of 16 I left to join the Army to escape. This never worked out as I got picked on a lot for being really tall and skinny, Yeah it was probably more banter but I had no confidence at all and was always self critical, sadly I couldn't leave till I was 21, I had smoked weed and started drinking at about 13 and stopped weed by the time I joined the Army but kept drinking, Started taking party drugs (mostly cocaine) as a crutch, when I was drunk I was a different person... a bit more confident and out there. I hated life, I woke up everyday just wishing I was dead until I turned 21 and could leave, it takes about a year to leave so you get out when you're 22, about 6 months before I turned 22 I started taking panic attacks, I never knew what a panic attack was at this point, never really heard of anxiety or mental health, I had felt like this before in my life but I just put it down to drugs or whatever but these panic attacks were bad, Really bad. I went to see someone about it and I know the story has been long so far so I will keep the rest short, after seeing a bunch of therapists and psychiatrists with and outwit the Army, getting put in a mental ward for telling one of them I WANTED to kill myself, not that I was going to, spending 2 months in a general hospital being told its just anxiety when I knew it wasn't when actually it was a bad reaction to sertraline, to having social services phoned on me about my nieces because I told a therapist that I had a thought about how horrible it would be if what happened to me happened to them, for context - my brother can't have kids the natural way because of his illness so he had twin girls through IVF and I love them to bits, they are probably the thing that have kept me alive because he might not be here soon and I wanna be there for them, and I had an intrusive thought about how sick it would be if what happened to me happened to them, I didn't want that thought and I felt sick for having it and when I told my therapist she basically called me a pedophile and phoned social services - So between a bunch of different medications, different therapists on the NHS, going private and spending £3,000 and still not feeling better.

Everyone has binned me, My private psychologist said she can't help me anymore unless I get put on medication which she can't prescribe. 

The NHS psychiatrist telling me ""you're 24, meds won't stop the bad thoughts and you feeling the way you do, you need talk therapy but we are discharging you from this mental health clinic""

Finally my GP just upping my meds that help me sleep and telling me to come back in 3 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I am lost, I don't know what to do, how to get better. I don't trust anyone in the system and I just want to get better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this. I am in desperate need of help and I have nowhere else to turn."

They are basically the only person that cares even a lil bit and ive been in a good mood today .

44,1,"I feel so worthless! I’ve done everything different this time. All the things my therapist said to do so I won’t go into a deep depression again. I went to my doctor to get help and all she gave me was anxiety pills, and they don’t even work. Everything hurts, my body and my mind. I hate going to sleep because every time I wake up it feels 10 times worse. I’m so scared I just want the pain to go away. I’ll do anything for the pain to go away. I feel weak and useless. Can y’all please help me, talk to me, hug me? Anyone I’m begging please Can someone please help me! Please help I fell off the deep end again and I don’t know how to get out. Please just anyone help me!"

46,1,"Hi everyone,
My psychologist recently asked me how I would feel about taking medication for anxiety and depression. She recommended Lexapro.
Of course I want to feel better, so I said that it sounded ok and I would probably give it a try. (I’m still a teenager though so she’ll have to talk to my parents about it)

But now, I’m having second thoughts.
The main reason is I’m doubting that there’s anything wrong with me. I mean, I am definitely having symptoms of depression, and a professional has even agreed it sounds like depression. 
Yet I’m still doubting it. It’s so frustrating because it’s making me think I’m crazy. I almost feel like since I don’t have it nearly as bad as some people, that mine doesn’t need to be treated or something, I guess. 

Like, whenever I smile or laugh, or my mood is ok or fine, I immediately start thinking, 'oh, you can’t be depressed if you were just smiling a minute ago' or 'if you feel fine then you’re not really depressed'. It changes too. One minute I could be 100% convinced that I am depressed, but then it can switch to me doubting everything. Sometimes I get a sudden urge to make things better, but I have no motivation to actually do anything about it. Or maybe I’m just lazy.
I’m so confused.
Is it just my head messing with me?

(sorry that this was probably really confusing by the way) doubting that I even have depression"
47,1,"Just looking for opinions and ideas for what makes you happy when you’re down.

48,1,"I feel really embarrassed when I post about my thoughts and feelings, but sometimes I just get so desperate to hear that it will be ok, even if it comes from a stranger.

I've been feeling more depressed in the last few weeks than I have in a really long time. I'm just so exhausted emotionally and mentally.

My family is pretty toxic and there is constant drama with them. I have a lot of unresolved resentment and angry for my mom and it makes it really difficult to have any sort of conversation with her. 

Recently my mom decided to move to another state with my stepdad (who I get along with pretty well). She said that I could take this chance to go with them if I pay for half of the move (even though she is not asking this of my two other adult siblings who are going as well, it's always been pretty clear I'm the least favorite). I've been struggling with this decision for a while because I've been really struggling financially,  just barely able to pay my bills. I usually have less than $50 by the time my next paycheck comes in. I don't know how I will be able to help pay for the move and also keep my car while searching for a job in the new state. I also dread the thought of living with my family again when we first get there while I find a place. My family is toxic even when I don't have to interact with them daily, living with them is pure hell. 

The reason I have seriously been thinking of going is because I hate the state I live in now. I live in a VERY overly religious state and because I am not religious,  I have a very difficult time dating and making friends here. I feel stuck and have wanted an opportunity to leave pretty much my whole life. I feel like this is my chance to finally go somewhere better.

Last week, I got an email saying my credit score dropped 130 points for a past due bill of $30. I paid the bill immediately because I didnt know that I had any outstanding balances anywhere and called the bank. The bank said this will stay on my credit report for 7 years. I have no idea why it dropped so much for just $30 but now I know it will be so much harder to find an apartment in this new state. 

There are a lot of other details to this that add to why I'm so depressed but this has already turned into a super long post and I'm sorry. I just have no one to get it out to. I have no friends, no money. I feel like I'm supposed to have this all figured out by now but I don't and I just don't see any light at the end of this tunnel. I just don't know what to do. Part of me just doesn't even care anymore and am just done with it all. 

I'm really sorry this is such a long post but even if no one has the patience time to read it all, I feel a little better typing it out. I just needed to get it out in some way because I'm this close to having some sort of breakdown. Feel like I'm hitting rock bottom and not sure how to lift myself back up."

50,1,"I’m a shy 21 years old, no friends, I never had a girlfriend, I never even had my first kiss. It feels so soul crushing; I feel so unwanted. I’ve tried online dating apps, paid for all the damn premium memberships nothing fucking works sadly. I can’t keep going like this, there’s gotta be better way of find someone right ? Or maybe that’s whole problem right there. Every day I feel myself becoming more bitter and more bitter at this whole dating run around. how can I stay energetic and happy to meet someone new if I know one little thing is an automatic ghost, from my experience most women on here expect you to fucking jump hoops just keep the god damn interested in you with zero effort on there part what type bull shit is that?? ( for the background to all my dating experience comes from online dating, I never tried walking up to random girls because my anxiety would just ruin my game tbh) what can I do? Where i can go to meet people? Maybe make some friends. Because i know i’m not a bad looking guy actually, far from it. i have a-lot of weight to lose but most woman don’t care about that. I’m just at my breaking point now how do I make a change in life?  I just want all this to end so I can finally be happy What’s wrong with me ?"

I want to get over with the army to pursue my dream which is to make music but i still have 4 months ahead of me which feels like going through hell. My parents tell me to be patient but i feel like they dont give a flying shit about me. Thats all the reasons to kill myself and i cant find even one reason not to. Reasons why not to kill myself."

I'm so tired. So so tired. Emotionally and mentally. They probably won't understand. I'm so tired gosh. Hopefully one day I can look at this post and laugh about how stupid I sound. But right now I'm just so tired. I'm so tired"
54,1,"Sorry I just need to get something, anything off my chest. I've been struggling with depression my whole life, more so in recent years. I've been unable to work for about three and a half years. 
A few months ago I was accepted into a workplace training program and it was great. It was hard, a couple of hours five days a week made me impossibly tired. I got home and just slept for hours each day. 
Now I'm att Four hours a day and was just about to try six hours out. 

But then things started to fall apart. I had proven to be able to work and therefore did not need help anymore. 
After a few days and a lot of help, I was able to get into a similar program, difference is the money. I'll get a lot less from this one, and it is more complicated. Lots of forms I need to fill out and get to the right person. 
It sounds so stupid when I write it, like boo hoo, I still have something. But it feels like hell either way. 

I had to move back in with my dad and family about a year ago. I can't keep living with them. They are not like me, they can't understand what I'm going through, it's not in their DNA. I am grateful that they let me move back home. But I feel so trapped, I can't be me, I can't do what I need to feel better. 
My family and I don't really get along. My stepmom hates me, my younger sister doesn't understand and my dad is, well he's living in a different world than I am. 

I recently got an offer to rent an apartment on my own. I knew there was no chance this dream would come true, but I still hoped. 
Since I'm not going to get the amount of money needed to afford to live by myself, I sought help from the government. 
I just got the call that they won't help me. 

So now I just feel stupid, stupid to have thought even for a second that things were gonna go my way. I didn't think I could feel anymore hopeless than I did. Boy was I wrong. I just wish the darkness would embrace me and take me away forever.

So here I am, no idea why I'm writing all of this. Just when I started to see a light in the darkness it was snuffed out.."

56,1,"Hey,

Long time lurker first time poster on this sub.

I've had the thought that I have some sort depression or mania-depresia of sort for the last 7 years or so. It comes in waves, could be a few hours, a few days, or more. There are good times as well but not a lot of them, and usually I end up regretting a lot of my actions during these time.

Lately it has gotten worse and I am feeling overwhelmed. I haven't worked in the last year or so, some of it by choice (took some time to see the world and time for myself) but ever since I came back 6 months ago I can't seem to be able to get my life together. I got rejected at every job interview I went to, I spent money on things I don't actually need in an empty attempt to make myself feel good.

I don't enjoy my hobbies anymore, they just feel empty now, and yet I keep sinking money into them.

I have no idea why I'm writing this down now. I got rejected from a big company I was really hoping to get to work for today. I don't believe writing this will help, but I need to vent and I got nowhere else to go.

I'm not really suicidal so you don't have to worry about that. The thought has gone through my mind a few times, but I'm not going to do it. I have a passion for good alcohol but stopped myself from drinking in the last 6 months or so, I don't think drinking right now is a good idea.

Tomorrow I plan to make an appointment with a doctor. Hopefully they'll be able to help.

That's all folks, thank you for reading my random thoughts. I hope you all have a better year than I had so far. Venting frustration"
57,1,"Of course it's on and off. So I'm on my semester break right now and it's actually been quite nice. Free of assignments and I get to hang with my best friend practically everyday. (Not that we don't in uni) 

But these last few days have been tough. I've just been so sad. I've cried for 3 days straight, my brain finding every single thing to be upset over. It's honestly tiring. I've gone through the same emotions. Anger, upset, sadness. 

It's not like I'm alone. I've actually gone out with a lot of people these past few days and they're all such nice people and we have fun but I just feel so useless. So lonely. It's gotten to a point where I've gotten short with my best friend which I will call Jack.

Jack is honestly one of the best people I've met. Till the day I die, I'll never regret knowing him. There was moments where I've doubted if he loves me as much as I love him. If he think I'm his number one as much as he is to me. Friendship wise at least. Two days I've talked to him crying and finally, yesterday we resolved my insecurities and our petty fights. I feel bad. He doesn't deserve this. He deserves better.

Both him and my girlfriend have told me multiple times how whatever ridiculous insecurities or thoughts I have are untrue and they love me. But I just can't help but feel like they're lying, you know?

It's tiring. I get jealous so easily too, probably because of my insecurities. I always feel like they deserve a better person. I'm not as good looking as they are. I'm at times emotional. They're better off with someone more capable, good looking and actually knows how to handle their emotional side. 

I just wish for it to stop. I want to feel happy and not have it die out by the end of the day. It's been 3 days and I'm still crying"
58,1,"I turned 19 today (drinking age in Canada) and all I've done is cry in bed all day. 

Most of my friends forgot it was my birthday, and I've been too depressed to find motivation to get my driver's license so I don't even have ID to go out drinking with. 

I just can't help thinking about how I've wasted my entire teenage years, all of high school and now a year (probably more to come) of university being too depressed and anxious to do the stuff I want to do, make friends and have fun. I know you can't just force yourself better, and I am in therapy currently but it's really not doing anything. I feel like no therapy or drug could possibly make me feel whole.  

I just feel like I'm gonna be stuck this way forever, and if I do ever get better it's going to be long after I'm no longer young and get to experience the things I want to. 

Any other teenage-age people feel this way? And anyone else get hella depressed on their birthday? Birthdays"

63,1,"Hi all....maybe someone can related and empathize. I'm almost 32 and really, really want a partner. I've been dating and looking for someone for close to the past 8 years now and never had a relationship last longer than 5 months. Of the three relationships I've had in the past 8 years, two have broken up with me on valentines day. The second to last relationship I had, the guy gave me an STD (HPV causing genital warts), which didn't show up until I was in the relationship with the guy after him. The last guy I was with, I was completely and totally in love with, and he made it seem extremely mutual. I thought I had finally found the person I was going to be with for life. He asked me to move in with him, but then broke up with me 3 days later. So now I'm single, my heart is completely crushed, and I have an STD. Unlike most people's HPV, mine hasn't gone away. It's been almost a year and I've tried tons of different things for it and none have worked. So it seems like I'm just going to have fucking warts forever, which means I can't even have sex. 

As you might imagine, my depression is back in full force. Every day I wake up and remember I have a disgusting disease that is going to make it impossible for me to have the ONE thing in life I want - love and companionship. I'm 31 so of course all my friends are getting engaged, married, buying houses, all of that. And I can't even go on a date anymore. All shreds of hope I had of finding anyone to share life with is gone. Every day I wake up and cry about it because I can't imagine anything worse than what I've gone through the past 8 years of getting my heart crushed and not being able to find anyone when everyone around me just easily finds love. And now I can't even TRY to find anyone anymore because I have an STD. 

I  feel like if there's something bad that can happen to me, it will. Who gets broken up with TWICE on valentines day? Who has someone want to move in, then break up with no warning 3 days later? Who else gets the HPV vaccine before they ever sleep with anyone, and has always used condoms, and gets warts, and unlike everyone else's warts, they won't go away? The chances of all of that happening are like .000000001%, yet they ALL happen to me. It's like every worst case scenario I can imagine in life comes true, and of course it all is stuff that will prevent me from ever finding anyone, which is all I want in life. I barely had any hope left for finding anyone BEFORE I got this fucking STD...now that tiny shred is gone. 

I know life is unfair, but I can't imagine a worse way to go through life than being alone and diseased and unable to even have sex, let alone find love. I guess I hadn't found love before this so maybe the STD doesn't even matter, but now I don't even have the illusion that I might find it in the future, so I can't even pretend like it's out there for me. 

I wake up every day and think about how horrible my life is and how I'm living my worst nightmare of being alone for the rest of my life. It doesn't seem worth it to live in this miserable way for the next \~60 years. It's incredibly painful to be surrounded constantly by the stream of weddings, engagements, etc. Even my friends who weren't actively looking for a partner all stumbled into finding love. I couldn't find any when I tried for 8 years, all I found out was that I'm unlovable. Now I'm unlovable and also undateable and untouchable. 

My mom has suggested I get a dog, but I also live in a super high cost living area, in a studio apartment that doesn't allow dogs. The only way I could ever afford to move is if I was living with someone and splitting costs. So now I also know that I'll never be able to move, or get a dog, both of which my ex and I were planning on doing which makes it all the more painful. I just don't see my life ever changing, at least not for the better. 

I just can't believe how shitty my life has turned out, and no one understands. Therapists haven't been any help, nor have my friends. Because literally nothing anyone can possibly say will change the fact I have an STD, and I was unlovable before this. 

If anyone bothered to read this, thank you. the knowledge I'm going to be alone my entire life has made it intolerable"

65,1,"So I finally slept alone last night for the first time in about 2 days. It may seem like a short amount of time, but within those two days I was battling something that I just couldn’t take and sleep on my own.

I had one of my best friends sleep with me on FaceTime/regular phone call (if it didn’t connect) because it was as if someone was really there and it made me happy. However, I realized that If I really want to change and be able to be independent again Im going to have to learn how to start doing things alone again. Yes, I will admit it was sort of uncomfortable at first just the thought, however when I really just started to just think clearly it all seemed to come so easy. 

I realized that I don’t need another lover/companion to make me happy, although it is a nice feeling. It all starts with myself. Before I am able to truly love someone again I have to learn how to love myself and be happy with who I am. Its starting to flow to me so much easier now, but I’ll admit it’s a hard mentality to keep in the early stage. However, I know if I really want to see change and really appreciate myself for who I am I have to keep going, not even for my ex, friends, or even family. I am and wanting to do this for myself to be happy again, and reconnected with my family and friends (in my most recent relationship i was independent however i relied on her for my happiness way to much).

66,1,"I wake up early in the morning without any clue what to do. I'm 21, and I always harp on the fact of my mortality, which is something I never thought about, and pushed to the back of my head. Still, I feel like my best days are behind me. I peaked in the past, and I can't return to how things were. Life only moves forward, but I feel like if my life ends now I should be okay with that. I didn't do everything I wanted, but I'm okay with the stuff I did do in my lifetime that made me satisfied. Sometimes, I simply just think being a live was pointless to begin with if I'm going to die in the end. Theese are feelings I Never had to cope with in the past. It seems no matter what I do, I see life as the same cycle of Death and life. I don't necessarily think that this nihilistic view is me either. Despite claiming things are pointless, and being bored I get a genuinely good feeling out of helping people out. I know it's born out of a selfish desire, but knowing I made someone happy makes me happy. I envy people who just go through life, and really don't think about this. As an Adult i'm stuck with a bunch of crushing realization. Bills don't pay themselves, following passion is hard,  Stuff doesn't always work out how you planned,  and people grow apart. I'm waiting for my purpose to come to me, but thats never how it happens. Defeating these feelings seem to be the greatest challenge of my life so far. I know im not the only one who feels this way. Integrating in society is hard, and I just accepted that Im not a strong person who can live independently. Sharp noises hurt my head, I overthink things, and sometimes I fail to see whats infront of me despite how simple it is. Anyways, sorry my thoughts are so scrambled at the end.

He's constantly in my personal space trying to get a rise out of me by hitting me and trying to start a sibling fight, and I'm sick of it. I went into my room to have a breather and he followed me started blaming me for talking to him like ""a three-year-old"" even though I was just talking in a monotone voice because I was sick of it and trying not to cry in front of him to give him more reason to take the mickey. when he left he said something that got to me, he said: ""sort yourself out"". The way he said it didn't help either he said it   
I know he didn't mean it the way I took it but it didn't matter and now I'm sat here crying and hoping he doesn't walk into my room. It sucks because I'm not 'being smart' or 'talking to him like he's stupid' I'm just trying to not show emotion so he cant use that to annoy me even more, I think it annoys him more because he can't get a rise out of me like he used to be able to.

I only spoke my native Spanish and the kids in nursery school apparently never spoke to me and my parents had to beg the administration to help. All because I was in the process of learning another language. Growing up bilingual, my parents told me to be proud and stay strong. I tried. As I got older, people became more hostile because of my clearly Spanish name. No one in small town Tennessee even knew where my home country, Ecuador, is on the map. I’ve been told to be proud to be Latina. All it has done is been a source of ridicule. Now it is legal ridicule because of the current president. I want to end this. I’m miserable enough on this earth as a Latina. I can’t even be proud of who I am because every single individual I meet looks at me in disgust because of my name or where I was born.

I don't want to kill myself because I don't want to die but I don't see much other choice. I can't get out of bed most days or even do the basic things like walk the dog, wash my dishes. Even brushing my teeth feels like a chore. I have a job just to make money so I have food to eat and I keep making mistakes there. I hate my job. I don't have an education so I don't have any other option except another shitty minimum wage job or to go back to school, which I can't afford.

I cannot remember the last time I was happy. I have been depressed since I was a child. My parents were abusive and my father blamed me for his own suicide attempts and incarceration. I know it's not my fault because I've been through years of therapy to learn the way they've treated me was not right but it still ruined my childhood and ruined the way I see myself as an adult.

74,1,"Hiii so I guess I will start this post by saying that I’m currently in law school and just finished my first year back in May. I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety, but now that I’m in law school it’s just gotten so much worse to the point that it’s almost unbearable and I can’t even concentrate on anything other than how shitty I feel about myself. In undergrad (which I understand is an entirely different animal than law school), I always made good grades (mostly A’s, some B’s) when I was actually giving it my best effort. But now in law school I’m trying so much harder than I ever have, and all I have to show for it is a bunch of C’s and C+’s. I would be fine with that if it wasn’t for the fact that our grades are based on a curve, so it’s all about how well you perform on the exam compared to your classmates. And then when I see the grade distributions and I’m always falling in the bottom 10-20 people in class out of like 70+, it just really makes me feel like a dumb piece of shit. And then to top it all off, I found out yesterday that I was rejected from all three of the legal journals at school when writing was the one thing I thought I was actually legitimately talented at but it turns out I’m unexceptional in that also. And then it sucks even harder when all of my friends are celebrating their much better grades and their success in the journal competition, and Im just out here bringing everybody down because I’m the only one who is constantly falling short at everything. So I’ve just been feeling super down on myself and very lonely because no one I know here can relate to feeling like a mediocre (at best) loser all the time because they’ve never done anything other than be highly successful. I just feel like everything I’ve done in law school so far has been a complete failure, and I feel like I’m wasting money putting myself through all of this because I will never be able to compete against these people who are clearly way more intelligent than me in the real world. Ughhhhhh...I think that’s enough though, so I will end my self-absorbed sob story here. If you made it all the way to this point, I deeply apologize, and I truly hope you have a much better day than I am having!

TL;DR Law school sucks. It has utterly destroyed my self-esteem, and no one I go to school with here can relate. Just feeling very hopeless &amp; alone"
75,1,"And i'm not talking about light sadness or depressive episodes on and off. I'm talking about being on the verge of suicide almost every day and being so miserable that way more than half of your energy every day goes to basic tasks, like taking a shower or cleaning teeth, even getting out of bed in the morning..



Now how the FUCK am i supposed to do an intense, difficult job every day, that's ruining my mental health even more? I obviously cannot not have a job and salary, bills won't pay themselves and food won't come to my doorsteps by it's own.


I truly don't know what to do i am burning out How the FUCK do you hold a job while depressed????"
76,1,I promise I will live a life that will make me happy. I will make you proud Jess. Love you forever. After the death of my best friend my depression just feels like meaningless drivel.
77,1,"-I was raped when I was 15 
-I tried to kill myself after an entire year of getting beaten and treated like human waste in my military school when I was a freshman
-I am obsessed with my abusive ex because I’ve been conditioned to think that I don’t deserve any better 
-My dad slammed my head into a car window when I tried to come out as gay and now he tells people that it never happened
-I don’t cut anymore even when I want to. But now when I SH I do things like bruise my rib cage or get into serious accidents 
-I have a very severe case of dissociative identity disorder and I don’t know how to handle it. 
-I hate my body despite no one else having a problem with it.

78,1,"I have been trying to piece myself together, for a fifth year now.

It is ludicrous how when I was in the darkest hour in my life, and I was happier. It was like living in the deep sea, all the unwanted rage, they pressured me together, they gave me a purpose. They gave me an enemy.

As long as you’re fighting something, you’re alive.

I didn’t win, I outlived. I endured. I survived. And I collapsed.

The final days of my high school years are just me counting days till I never have to see any of their faces again. Until I don’t have to pretend not remembering how they completed destroy me, until I don’t have to talk to them with a fake smiley face, until I wouldn’t have to look over my shoulders, until I don’t have to run away from anybody, until I can lift up my head, until I can be me.

And the day had come, five years ago.

You’d think time will heal. Not everything, but at least SOMETHING, but no, everyday I just feel like I’m drowning and screaming silently. I have no idea how I became this. Yes, I do have a job, in the exact same school I was bullied in. I don’t particularly feel anything. You can say that I’m just...a living void.

One can say that there are a lot of people who have been bullied in their lives, and they’ve turned out okay. Maybe. Maybe it’s just me being much too sensitive, or it’s just my cry for help, while in reality none of these will make me any better.

I’m just, confused and empty. I use to buy food and let them rot. I wanted to eat but I let myself starve. I had choices but I didn’t make them.

It is easier to just give up, but I made it. I finished my master’s degree with a decent score. Find myself a job, find myself a SO, find myself a bunch of friends. 

None of the above can actually chase away the darkness for me. I’ll have to do it myself, and I probably wouldn’t win, not at first.

I can give up, it’s easy to do so, but I wouldn’t.

This is just me, fighting my inner darkness, one day at a time.

Thank you for reading.

I’ll keep on living, until the day I can’t. Until then, my friends, until then. I have been trying to piece myself together, for a fifth year now."
79,1,"I haven't been happy in about 2 years. It's like I only have 2 settings now, crushing sadness and loneliness, and numbness. I'm either miserable or feeling nothing. I fucking hate this. I've been trying so hard to get better, to push myself to improve myself and repair the relationships I've ruined by isolating myself from others, but it's like I'm just running in place. Nothing I do has any meaning. I just wish I could get hit by a car or something so mom doesn't blame herself when I die. Why can't I just be normal?"
80,1,"Idk why but I always lie to everybody about how I'm really feeling, I always want to cry, yet I tell everyone I'm happy, everybody thinks I'm better than what I actually am.. Nobody really knows how much I'm hurt and how much I continue to hurt,

82,1,"At 40, my husband of 20 years have decided to embrace his midlife crisis and leave me for a 20-something woman. On his way to his new sparkling life, he decided to destroy my spirit as well. He unloaded on me everything that he believes is wrong with me and how he can do/want so much better. He admits that he's been holding me up to an ideal that I'm unable to meet. After 20 years he said he's tired of the all the pain he feels and work he has to do trying to get me to meet those ideals. He realized after all these years that he's not the kind of man who would work to commit to a relationship. I've absorbed it all like a sponge. I've always been this way, where it's hard for me to take a compliment, but very easy to believe criticisms and insults.

Family is no help. They actually make me feel worst. Divorce is frowned upon in my culture and religion. And they have let me know in more ways than one that they blame me for the divorce. He made a lot of money and they had a lot of respect for him because of that. I get this from them: ""What did you do?"" ""You'll have a hard time finding someone as good as him at your age."" I even overheard my mother making fun of me on the phone with her friends.

We shared friends and they are uncomfortable with the divorce as well. They ""don't want to take sides"" and therefore abandoned both of us. I guess they were never truly friends. It's fine for him because he now hangs out with his new girlfriend and his new 20-something friends from work and wants nothing to do with his old life. But I have no one. So here I am, creating a reddit account hoping for some advice and support from internet strangers... Divorce and depression"
83,1,"I have already been going through the start of a depression for the past month or so due to feeling worthlessness about being poor and anxiety due to paying for college, but my girlfriend breaking up with me was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

We had been dating for about 3 years. I’m pretty sure she has had indifferent feelings towards me for the past year or so because we had a lot of relationship problems. She’s very distant and I’m very passionate. I could never be what she wanted no matter what I tried.

She never came out to her parents as bi (we are both women btw) and as a result just decided to give up living that double life which I understand but the selfish side of me wishes she picked me. I would of made it work she could of lived with me and my family I would of done anything for her to love me again. We are talking like normal friends now and she just seems so much happier. She probably just hates my guts and wants me to die. That’s what it felt like in the relationship half the time anyways.

I can’t vent to anyone bc I’m just a bitch baby who doesn’t know how to vent without feeling embarrassed but I hate myself. Everyone always leaves me and nothing turns out the same. I just wanna lose my memory and live alone off the grid or something. I lose everything because I don’t know how to sustain anything. I hope I die sometimes I want to just disappear"

But then one day she started getting really flirty so much so to the point where shed call me her boyfriend around her friends, and yes i felt like she was joking, but then she then goes on to tell me that her crush was one of the 3 people she had told me, one of the 3 being me. and what makes me fall deeper into her trap is the fact that the other 2 guys were her past crushes, people she barely even talked to anymore. most if not all sign pointed at me, so i decided to risk it all. i shot my shot. missed. and honestly felt alright with it. but what really hurt me was when she started calling me bitter, which to be honest i was a little, i felt like her personal love toy, that being a one time confession use toy. and then she proceeds to not take the blame for anything she did to me, she couldnt even admit that it was some what wrong of her to give me even the slightest bit of hope that there couldve been an us. and now im crying alone in my room, with nobody to talk to, almost all my ""friends"" havent even replied to me in the 10 mins ive been typing this shit. i dont really expect much from posting this but im really thankful that some of u took the time to read my story, youve already put more effort than most kf my supposed ""friends"". please learn from my stupid mistakes. i have nobody to talk to and im losing my mind rn... please bare with me..."
85,1,"Hey, I'm 13 and I've suffered from (really bad) depression and serotonin deficiency for a few years before recently starting to get treatment and during that time I used Youtube as a coping mechanism. I was really lonely and being on youtube made me feel like I was part of a community and made me feel less lonely but now I feel like I'm addicted and it's getting in the way of my life. In the past, I've spent entire summer holidays from morning to night watching youtube videos to avoid my terrible feelings as much as I can and the next school holidays are coming up and I'm worried I'll fall into the hole again. But after being on youtube for so long I've naturally become really attached to it and I don't want to leave it all behind. It's like a fear of missing out the type of thing. But once I start I don't stop (until something like school gets in the way) but even if I wanted to I don't know how I would. I don't know what to do about this I should talk to the school counselor but I'm really embarrassed.

And if I tell him that I don't want to commit suicide? Will that drop his priority?

89,1,"Since 14 (now almost 20) I knew exactly what school and program I wanted to enter and after I was rejected after applying my first time I was crushed but not depressed, that following summer after high school was the happiest I’d ever been in my life. Fast forward through a year of living at uni where the stress of school made me exhausted as I was trying to keep up perfect grades to apply again to this program, I left first year with +20 pounds after losing 50 throughout high school and a bad mental state. Not sure what changed during the summer but I found out that I was accepted into this dream school and my eating patterns catapulted into something i never thought would happen. I began working in a factory and would bring a 200 calorie lunch, go to the gym after work and eat 1000 calories after so I could go to sleep feeling full. Then as weekends came I would binge and try to purge but could never go through with it thankfully. Come second year and I’m starting at my new program but what I thought would be the happiest year of my life was the worst, my desire to talk to family, friends and even go to the gym deteriorated as all I cared about was school. For the past almost year since September I struggle to wake up. I’ve always been a disciplined student from nothing other than my desire to have perfect grades, which I still managed to keep up during the year but this summer as I study for the MCAT I cannot keep focus for more than 30 minutes. My dream is to become a doctor and I know I can accomplish it but it is becoming so frustrating that this thing eating my mind is now also affecting my academic performance. I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to and at this point I’m not sure how much more I can handle before I have a break down. 

I know this is long so i understand if people don’t read but please if you can relate, please share how you overcame this. Started at my dream program in uni that I’ve wanted for 5+ years after being rejected the first time and my mental health has since declined a lot worse than when I found out I was first rejected"

 I can be 120mph on the highway and it does not seem as fast as it was, and I do not feel how it can cause an accident like I felt before, I can fight with some friend of mine for some reason, and cant realize what it can cause to my “circle of friends”, I can go out with a girl and have sex, and at the end of the day everything that happened seems like a vague thing, the worst is that I do not realize the possibilities that I have to improve my life or do things that I never did, because I do not care anymore.

The only things that bring me a momentary happiness is speeding, chatting with some woman, drink alcohol and after all this ends my depression hits 4x stronger, what I think is more ironic is that people who know me think that I am a super happy guy with a high self esteem, it must be because I am funny when I'm with friends or girls, but deep down I'm depressed

I suspect it has something to do with withdrawal symptoms, I've been on effexor 75 mg per day for 5 months, tried to stop it cold turkey , but it was horrible,  so I tapered it down, for a week I felt ok , but then my mind start acting up again, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, loss of motivation.

100,1,"About 6 months ago me and another girl kissed when I was in a relationship with someone else.

Some background info; I am a bisexual girl and this happened at a big party where everyone got really drunk. I was too drunk to remember a big portion of the night, including the kiss. The girl told me a couple days later when I saw her again and I immediately told my boyfriend because I believe that honesty improves a strong relationship. He got very upset, as I expected. The image of him when I told him, his anger, his disgust, is burned into my eyelids and I still see it almost every night when I try to sleep, even though it was like 6 months ago.

After this I never felt the same. He trusts me again but inside of me something has broken. I don't trust myself. Me and my boyfriend love each other so much, but I apparently still go around kissing others. I don't know how I will be able to trust myself again.

Everytime I drink alcohol I get really depressed because of it's association with what happened. Every time that party comes up I completely shut down.

I haven't told anyone else because I don't have other people I trust enough with this subject. I don't want them to look at our relationship as if it failed, because it's the best thing that has ever happened to me.

It makes me so frustrated, sad and angry that this had to happen when my life was going well for a change. I just want my life back on track again and to feel as though it is worth pursuing.

I still have friends but they feel so superficial like if if leave or not talk to them I would be all alone.
And that hurts it's always kinda been like that been treated really bad in my life got bullied really hard and no I'm struggling.
I think I'm very open but maybe I'm not? I don't know I talk about my problems to my friends and they always listen but does that mean I'm open?

The text we have are usually the same and I feel bored by that I try to make things more exciting but it won't work.
I have a friend who is one I think they really do like me and out talks are never boring.
But I'm quite envious of her as she has a lot of people looking out for her wanting to spend time with her.

I’ve done the best job of my life controlling my depression over the past year, but today I had a  bit of a breakdown.  There are certain things that I can’t even think about or else it’ll send me into a vicious mental cycle of self loathing.  Depression restricts my thoughts.  I am constantly playing a game where I have to keep my thoughts clear of certain ideas or memories or else I surrender myself to that familiar hopeless feeling in the bottom of my stomach.  Depression prevents me from unlocking my mind.  I don’t think I’ll ever be able to reach my full potential while having to play a game of chicken in my own brain.  

I’ve been off antidepressants for the past 10 months, and while I consider it to be the greatest accomplishment of my life I think I’m cursed to live a life of walking on eggshells with my mind.  I don’t know if it ever truly goes away, but if this is the way I’m cursed to live my life I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to truly be happy.

111,1,"As I traverse my most recent and current bout with depression, I’ve been asking myself: how can I help myself? Well, as it turns out, the answers aren’t that hard to find. There are things all around me that add to my depression and I’m fully aware of them and have been for quite some time. Today I’m taking control.

Social media provides “services” for us that ultimately contribute little to our overall well-being. They basically suck the souls out of users, get us hooked on their platforms, shove ads down our throats and makes billions of dollars in the process. What do we get? Nothing.

I woke up this morning and decided to eliminate things that really don’t add anything to my life, and replace those things that impact my life in positive ways. I started with social media apps. Facebook being the first to go.

For me, Facebook is the most toxic and only underscores the superficial, the passing interests of the day, political outrage of the moment (a big one for me), and people trying really hard to convince themselves and everyone else that the world would be perfectly fine if we just saw things their way. Oh, and then there’s all those narcissistic posts. Facebook is not real life and if you ask for advice on Facebook, typically all you get is placated with platitudes and patronized. It’s time for more face-to-face human interactions and fewer meaningless interactions.

The second app to go, Instagram. I didn’t have that many followers in the first place, but I followed a lot of beautiful people with seemingly stunning lives. Who knows if these people really experienced lives as extravagant and glamorous as they I, or anyone else perceived them to be. It’s hard to say, but whatever the case, thumbing through pics of “the beautiful people” is not real life either. It’s people offering up a FaceTuned photo, one out of 50 I’ll bet, and getting their dopamine hit. Trying to keep up with that kind of energetic existence is, for me, untenable.

The third social media account to go was Twitter. This was a hard one because I barely knew anyone, but I had thousands of followers because of my profession. But I’ve never received any meaningful gratification from Twitter (or any social app aside from Reddit) so there’s no love lost there. I liked my lists, but Reddit has better lists quite honestly.

The irony of this post is here I am posting this on Reddit. A story about a social media purge to a different social platform, and I’m okay with it. I don’t know why, but Reddit feels different. No one is coming for me, no one is trying to hookup with me, no one likes every fucking thing I post, and no one even knows my name or where I live. It feels freeing.

Depression is a fucker and I’m sick of feeling this way day after day. I know what dark energy can do for my self-esteem and I know what the light can do. I know that sulking around the house is no good for me, I know I have to get out of the house more. I know I have to cut out foods and beverages that affect my behavior and I have to get back to the gym. I know these things. It’s time to take control and do these things. Depression Additives"
112,1,I can't tell anyone about this so I will say it here. I WANT TO DIE. SOMEONE HIT ME WITH A TRUCK. I WANT TO DIE. LET ME DIE. I KEEP TRYING TO DISTRACT MYSELF TO KEEP GOING BUT I AM SO SO TIRED. THERE IS GAPING HOLE INSIDE ME AND I AM SO LOST. I WANT TO DIE. PLEASE KILL ME. LET ME DIE
113,1,"But how do I help people when I'm not good at anything?

And even trying will result in ultimate failure. The only joy i get these days is helping other people"
114,1,"Hey, I’ve called out of work due to my depression twice in the last week. You only get 4 call outs for the season and I’ve already used up three. Am I being immature by calling out due to depression? I feel like I rly need to recover. Calling out of work today"
115,1,"I had a weird dream about how my life is going and I woke up with only one thought. Nothing has changed. Since I woke up almost 12 hours ago I’ve been more depressed. My heartaches from a heartbreak, my head hurts bad sometimes I do really consider suicide. I might not do it just yet, but the possibility could be there. I had a dream"
116,1,"I have been having trouble planning for the future. It’s like I’ve got some kind of block in my mind. I am just convinced I won’t be here much longer and I can’t even think about what I might be doing in the future. I can’t even plan a few days ahead. I have no future. 

I have had two friends reach out over the last few weeks and try to plan things with me but it’s not helping. One I have always felt unable to connect with emotionally and open up to. The other is the total opposite, but feeling good with him feels bad. We used to have a much closer relationship but things went bad for a while. I feel like he’s the only person who really gets me, and that I feel comfortable around. But I don’t think we will ever have the same type of relationship that we used to have, the kind I desire, but he doesn’t. 

I have been casually agreeing to all future plans because I don’t think I’ll be here to follow through anyways. And agreeing to it pleases my friends. All my therapist wants to talk about is the future, I go along with the discussion but it is hard sometimes because I haven’t actually given it any thought. 

I have been fantasizing about running away with my dog. She is the only thing that brings me some kind of joy. Sometimes I think that maybe if we were alone together somewhere else I’d feel different. I used to enjoy sleeping too but the nightmares have ruined that. I don’t go through with leaving because I know it probably wouldn’t actually change anything. I can’t think ahead"
117,1,"This is my first time posting, thanks for reading. 

I'm 36 years old and facing a career transition. I'm in a bad rut.  I've finished my Master's degree in Bioinformatics, but am finding it IMPOSSIBLE to find a job in my field. I would love to get a position as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst. I feel like I have been ghosted by countless employers. If I reach out to hiring managers or contacts on LinkedIn, I am ignored. I always make sure to sound passionate about the position or company I am applying to. Those contacts that have talked to me can't seem to help my get a job, but are telling me that I'm, ""doing all the right things."" 

I keep trying to improve myself by studying more and doing projects (cause if I don't use it, I will lose it). I even put in a check today to hire a career coach to see if I am doing anything wrong in terms of interviewing or my skills. 

I just want to scream at the world cause I just feel like I have no idea what I am doing wrong. What seems to make things worse is seeing everyone around me just apply for something and then get it. Oh yes they worry about it, but in the end, it just works out. I worry about my own predicaments, follow up, try hard - and hear nothing. 

I just pray that someone takes a chance on me. In the meantime, all I can do is prepare. I just hope that I am working on the correct types of projects and studying the right kind of material. Extremely depressed over how stuck I am moving so slow in life."
118,1,"Some cleaning job, cleaning at different companies.

One is supposed to take 2 hours and 18 minutes but it takes me like 3 hours. No one cares if I'm there longer or shorter as long as I do what I'm supposed to but it's not fun working about 5 hours (honestly probably more) per week for free because I clean so fucking slowly.

I don't even know how I'm cleaning so slow. Yesterday I worked 50 minutes extra, today it was 'only' 20 minutes extra. Maybe I had a little less to do but I also tried not to be a perfectionist and keep the tempo up. Still didn't finish in time.

I also cleaned at a second company today and cleaned like 40 minutes extra.

I feel so fucking stupid and worthless.
Apparently company #2 complained that I didn't clean the toilets well last week and I've been feeling bad about it - don't know how it was bad but ok whatever.

Basically I hate life and wakng up at 6 am makes me want to end it all &lt;3 I'm working multiple hours a week for free because I suck and I'm slow"
119,1,"I barely have enough energy or care at all to make this post, but I just genuinly don't know what to do. I feel like I'm trapped running circles and achieving nothing.

I don't want to do anything. I don't want to see anyone. At the same time I have so much I want to do and people I want to see. It just feels pointless. Nothing ever stays good. Everything will fail eventually. 

Im in a constant roundabout of emotion, leading to absolutely fucking nowhere. I've been wasting my time on bullshit and I'll continue to waste my time on bullshit if I get the chance.

I want to do absolutely nothing and slowly just fade away until i'm dead. I feel like nothing. I don't care about anything. I get excited about something one second then feel absolutely empty the next. I feel worthless, pathetic, sad and alone and that will never change.

I just want to quit my job leave my house toss my phone and never come back. I fucking hate myself"
120,1,"used up a lot of my energy trying to stay positive. this week has been rough. I am tired and everything is so... plain, I guess. everything feels so monotonous. I just cut contact with all my friends. I just want to be alone or run away or just disappear. I know life can be really great but I don’t know how to be happy. I’m trying my best but it’s just hard. I want to be happy but it just feels like I am a horrible person that way. I like me better when I’m depressed. I am a lot nicer, more considerate, much more empathetic, and more helpful. I hate the insensitive, bitter, and cold person I am when I’m happy. I hate myself so much and I don’t know how to change or love myself. 


I feel so empty. or sad. or tired. I don’t know. 


I’m sorry for wasting your time if you read this, just needed a release. I wish I could redo everything and take it all back. don’t want to die. just want to sleep for a little while."
121,1,"Honestly I have no idea why I do it. I would catch myself conjuring up images in my head about the different ways I would die, and then I’ll feel a painful twinge in my heart. When the pain stops, it feels really good. So I do it again. And again.

I don’t want to commit suicide and I kind of can’t afford to die right now, but it’s very enjoyable for me to think about the life leaving my body: very slowly, my breath coming to a stop, the light leaving my eyes, and my body getting cold. Now that I’ve written it down, it makes me feel like a sicko. It pains me to fantasise about my death but I like it"
122,1,I don’t exactly tend to visit subs like this because it saddens me that so many people deal with these sort of issues but I just wanted to say how badly it hurts to see all these kids saying that they have depression because their girlfriend/boyfriend broke up with them. It’s such a normal thing to hear now that people are starting to think it’s not bad because apparently everyone has it. Meanwhile the kid in the corner can’t make a single friend in school because their anxiety is so bad and they cry themselves to sleep every night from depression and self harm. People label themselves with mental illnesses like it’s nothing.*”oh I felt sad 2 times this week I must be severely depressed”*. Poor kids out there actually need serious help but they’re too scared to say anything and if they did who would take them seriously? I’m sure some would but a lot of kids would just be like “MOOD”. I don’t know exactly why I wrote this but I just felt like I needed to. How easy depression goes overlooked

125,1,"I completely failed uni this year because I just could not study, my brain wouldn’t allow it. Decided today to quit my job to focus on uni but I can’t help but feel I’m a failure for not being able to study and keep a job while everyone else seemingly can.

I haven’t been this depressed before in my whole life, I’ve started having suicidal thoughts for the first time and I’ve been waiting so long to see a therapist but still have not got a letter from the doctor. I want to give up. Quitting my job, falling deeper into the hole"
126,1,"About a month ago, I took a break from friends, social media, and the like to separate myself from it all and be able to center. As well as to work through a few troubling things in my life at the time. Well, depression is REALLY kicking my ass right now and it's unbelievably difficult to stay positive. So I guess this is part two of my intermission.

I just really want to be happy... Taking another break from social media and life for my mental and emotional health. 🖤"
127,1,"After a conversation with a colleague today, I started considering if I was all right in the head, as I was told I was behaving in a concerning way. It got me thinking, and I took some online depression surveys, all of which said I had high end moderate to severe depression.

Now, it is the internet, so I might just be a bit of a pussy paranoid, but better to make sure that I'm all right with myself.

Over the last couple of years, I've become increasingly apathetic about everything that happens in my life. I don't really feel sadness, or really anything, I've found little pleasure in life except in maybe things like TV and video games, and even then it's hit or miss many times. I've even had two grandparents die within the past 6 months, and both times I felt almost nothing.

But in contrast, when some people do something I don't like, I get sudden bouts of extreme rage. To deal with this, I usually use my nails to claw my own hands, as I think the pain helps me get grounded and controlled.

Is there anything else I should look out for? Signs of depression?"
128,1,"I've come to the conclusion that I'm never going to get better, and there is literally nothing I can do but wait to die. I'm so tired of trying bullshit medications and therapy and TMS and ketamine, because none of it works. 

My brothers girlfriend has some mild depression, and experienced some symptom reduction with just an SSRI (lmao) and as amazing as that is, that's not my reality. Some people just dont get better. Period. Some people cant be helped. Some people are just destined to lay there and wait for death or the courage/motivation to facilitate it. 

I've tried for 7+ years now to even gain some improvement, but each year I become less and less functional, more hopeless, and less convinced that psychiatry and psychology know what they're talking about. In trying to come to terms with being bed ridden and useless forever, but I'm just fucking angry. 

I cant stand people who get better. Like....good for fucking you. Count yourself lucky and go live life, because I sure as hell never will. I'm so fucking tired"
129,1,"I feel sad so much and like often get thoughts that i don't want to live, but there are times when i feel as if i'm just being a bitch for having those thoughts? Like I feel as if i don't have any reason to feel that way and it makes me feel ungrateful and furthers my self-hatred. However I still feel like I don't have any motivation to continue life after a certain point. I'm like young so idk if its just like natural feelings. I don't really talk to people in real life about like the extent of my feelings cos i don't want to be a burden, and i already tried but like one of the people pretty much forgot and so that left me feeling as if it was pointless. I'd say my feelings have like properly been around for roughly a year but have evolved from like daily fits of crying n braking down to like now where i don't feel much at all except just like a mellow sad vibe. I feel as i'm just living my life on auto-pilot now and i just zone out all the time, but with this constant sickening feeling of anxiety or paranoia. I'd like to reiterate that i feel as if i'm just bitching and i see talking about it a waste of time as i'm probably just being dumb but like i just wanted to write down a brief summary, not really in depth so that i can like see it for myself. so to like sum it up, i'm just constantly in some sort of sad state with anxious vibes but I am probably just over-reacting. Im confused with myself"
130,1,"This year has been really hard for me, I tried my best in school and my social life. I confessed to my crush and did everything I could for school. I still failed, too much stress and too little motivation caused me to be instable. I looked happy from the outside, but on the inside I was a mess. I have 4 insufficients on my paper and I every time I think it went well, it’s another insufficient. I can’t handle it anymore. My dream is broken and I am broken, I will probably give up and go to a lower level of education which will be the end of my hoped carreer. Idk what to do but Idk if i want to.

This took me a lot of effort to write so dont be harsh. I’m about to fail school"
131,1,"I've been living alone, not attending school, not working. My days feel short and unfulfilling. I've been cooking less, ordering out more even though I loved cooking. 

My lease is up soon and I have no idea where I'm living next. I'm taking fall classes but I haven't worked out paying tuition or housing yet. 

A typical day for me now is waking 7-9a, going to the gym, showering, and then trying to clean my apartment. It's becoming harder to maintain cleanliness. Then I put on twitch while playing videogames. There's a distinct moment while cleaning when I realize I don't really want to clean, so I give up and go straight into degenerate mode.
My social life, love life, finances, academics, self esteem, and self efficacy have plummeted. 

The upsides are my first upcoming therapy session, and my workout streak.

My goals for the year were to graduate college and to reach a certain weight and body fat %.

133,1,"Recently I had a couple of terrible experiences with the dentist and I wonder if any others have developed a fear of them because of experiences like this rather than the whole dentists and their scary tools reason.

On both occasions the dentist made me feel bad about myself for the standard of my dental care (which the hygienist comnented wasnt that bad) and was very forceful with maneouvering my mouth

She later told me I had lost a filling and didnt bother to explain what this meant. When I asked she replied in a judgemental tone, ""you dont know what a filling is?"" I have a history of anxiety and sort of froze in that moment. Walking out and reflecting on it I felt so uncomfortable and belittled that I now have a great fear of going to the dentist.

Curious to hear if any others have had similar experiences and now have a fear of dentists/similar professions because of it! Has anyone developed a fear of going to the dentist/similar profession because of the way they interacted with you?"

135,1,"I am probably not go to college. If I do, I will probably fail or drop out. I will probably be kicked out by who ever I'm leeching off of at the time. I will either become homeless, or live a boring existence slaving at a minimum wage job. If I do go to college, I'll probably hate whatever I learn eventually, it's just me. I'll hate my job as I slave away for a bit more money. If I fall into ""love"", I will probably fail it again. Shit's too complicated, lets be fucking honest here. Regardless, I don't think I'll ever be content with my life. I'll probably end up killing myself, hopefully. Actually, I'll probably be too weak to do it. 

And I don't think I'm going to make an effort to change anything. Every time that I'm motivated, it quickly falls through. Every time. This is just a mindset now.

Every task seems impossible. Even if it doesn't, I just can't see the point to it. I just give up. If I don't, then it's far more painful than it should be. I do this to myself. Every fucking task, it's too hard.

I hate that I don't know more, about a lot of things. From the fact that I have a pathetic amount of skills, to not knowing myself well. 

I don't know myself. I constantly think but just confuse myself or learn to hate more. I constantly change, my mind is inconsistent, I don't like it, I don't have an anchor.

I'm not a good person even though I would like to think I'm one. Some people I treat so well, others I simply don't, there's no real consistency here. And those who I do treat well, typically don't reciprocate it, and sometimes even take advantage of it. 

I don't like being in my own skin, it's uncomfortable. I don't like looking at myself in the mirror.

No matter what I say, it just wont change this discontent I have. I can't explain it well. All I am is pathetic. I don't deserve pity however, I did this to myself, and I'm not willing to change. I don't really know what I want. Suicide slowly becomes more appealing however.

136,1,"I'm a 31 year old male, have a job, its okay money but due to some mistakes i've let stuff get on top of me. Nothing major but its there. I still live with my parents i'm single not through lack of trying but no one seems to want me. I've been on several anti depressants but stop taking them after a while because I want to be happy without the aid of tablets. I've been to a group therapy and seen someone one to one. The group kind of helped but as of Tuesday 2nd of July they have ""released me"" even though I told them i'm far from okay. 

I feel like I have no friends. The people who tell me they are my friend I either don't believe but are certain they are lying and out to get me. The friends i did have growing up are no where now. I never feel welcome anywhere I go. The last couple of months have hit me hard. I get a slight hint that someone I know cares about me but sometimes i really don't believe her and i don't trust her anymore. She is away at university for a couple more months so is busy alot. She's the key to my happiness but its not fair on her. I feel like bringing this up to anyone makes me a burden. I get asked if i'm ok to which I say yes but its to get them to leave me alone. I really feel i'm going no where and have thrown years away where I could have made something of myself. I currently am sitting alone, hungry but don't really want to eat. I just want to disappear and stop being a burden to people.

I am having 100% positive  feedback on freelance platform and have top rated flair there.

I am making music. I thought that's something that makes me happy.

But there is no sense. I have depression attacks all month. Idk why they appear suddenly without a reason. I can't concentrate. I can't work. Sometimes I am sitting on the floor and wait till it goes. But I don't know what actually goes. No thoughts. Nothing. Just the feeling of despair and colors become grey.

I tried leaving home and meet with friends. It helped only for the rest of that day. The next day everything was back again. I can't meet with them everyday cause I need to work. But I can't work. I am pushing myself to work and doing it really slowly and as a result I don't have time to meet with friends cause I need to work. If I won't work then I can't meet them cause I need money to survive and thus I need to work. That's vicious circle.

I tried asking for help on betterhelp when had intense despair, but then seen their prices and dirty marketing tricks they are using and decided that they are other psychological quacks that will advice me to sleep well and eat well and other crap. Unless previous time when I prefered using drugs to psychological work cause it has instant effect now I want to work on myself but it's not affordable. Pack of SSRI for 2 month cost 10 times cheaper than first payment of that totally unclear shit with results in 3 years.

139,1,"Hi everybody. I've been a vet tech for about 3 years and lately, probably within the last 6 months or so, my compassion fatigue has exponentially worsened.  
I've always been a sensitive and extremely compassionate person (especially towards animals), and struggle with chronic depression and anxiety. Along with my job as a tech, I foster and volunteer for a local rescue. I can't pinpoint exactly when it started or what triggered it, but now I feel dead inside. It's worsening every single day.  
  
Animals no longer bring me joy. Whenever I'm around my own pets all I can think about is them dying. I used to be so passionate about different animal advocacy issues but can no longer care. 
 
When I see someone spend $3800 on some inbred puppy and then decline everything due to ""finances"", or see someone drop their perfectly healthy cat off for euthanasia, I just shrug and go on with my day instead of getting upset and feeling bad.  

  
I have nothing left in me. I want to die.  
My job offers no support. I've brought the issue of compassion fatigue up before and have been told not to be so negative. My boss said if I'm feeling burnt out, I must not really want to work there and hinted at letting me go.
  
I'm not posting this for any other reason than to tell someone. I can't do it anymore. I can't. But I need my job.  

I have no capacity for compassion or empathy anymore.  I'm dead inside. I can feel compassion fatigue getting worse by the day."

141,1,"We were in a relationship for a year, It was a long distance relationship but we were crazy about each other. It was my first real relationship and after we broke up I just couldn't handle myself. And now almost a year has passed and I still feel empty. I hooked up once in between but that didn't feel right. I don't know what to do. I try to keep myself busy but nothing works. I'm a 18y/o male and I need help. I've never opened up about this before.

142,1,"I am re-posting [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/c8odyw/i_messed_up_and_am_in_a_downward_emotional_spiral/) from r/mentalhealth here as I am just looking for whatever help I can get.

&amp;#x200B;

To  preface, I have had emotional issues for a long time. I was in a bad  marriage that left some deep scars. I have had a hard time opening up to  people (friends or family), I have a hard time trusting people, my self  esteem is pretty low, and have balled up every emotion I have ever had  and suppressed it deep inside for many many years now. It has made me  feel like complete garbage, but I didn't know what else to do, and  didn't think I needed help.

&amp;#x200B;

After  my marriage I jumped right in to another relationship, and it was very  co-dependent. She was an amazing person, but my emotional issues were  deep. She also had similar issues, and at times we clashed quite a bit.  Fast forward 3 years. We were engaged and about a month away from our  wedding. We had a pretty good thing going on. There was lots of love.  However, we had a big fight. It was over an issue that had come up many  times in the past, but this time it was different. The emotions ran high  in this one. We were both screaming at the top of our lungs, saying  things we didn't mean. She got in my face, screaming,  and I just had a knee jerk reaction to it. A stupid, stupid reaction  that has sent me in a spiral. When she got in my face, I just put my  hands up and pushed her back. Didn't even think about about. It was one  of those moments where your body just reacts to a stimulus, and there is  nothing you can do.  She stumbled back a few steps and tripped over the  hamper and fell on the floor. And that was the moment my life changed.

&amp;#x200B;

20  minutes later I was in handcuffs in the back of a police cruiser being  taken away. I have no criminal record. I have never laid my hands on  anyone before, especially her. I have no history of violence, I have no  history of abuse. I'm a very quiet, introverted person, on the  anti-social side, and I would never hurt anyone. My whole life came  crashing down on me in this instance. I lost the love of my life. My  best friend. My family. The place I called home. I lost it all, and I  hurt her emotionally beyond anything I can even comprehend.

&amp;#x200B;

I  have also destroyed myself. Not a day goes by that I don't cry. I can  no longer hold in my emotions. Its like a flood gate. They poor out  every second of every day and I don't know how to handle it. I don't  know how to cope, or deal with any of this. I don't know how to handle  these emotions. I face serious charges that could destroy everything I  have worked so hard to accomplish in life. I now have this label of an  ""abuser"" over my head that I still cant wrap my mind around. Every day  feels worse than the next.

&amp;#x200B;

I  have been in steady therapy since this has happened. I have opened up  to friends and family as a means of support. But it all just seems like  too much at times. I am just overwhelmed by everything. Everything I  feel, everything I have caused for others, everything I am facing. I  just don't know what to do with it all, or how to handle it and feel  like I am losing the battle. They same time heals all wounds, but I just  feel like its getting worse.

&amp;#x200B;

What  do I do? I just don't know what to do with any of this. I need help,  and have taken steps but I just feel like I am not doing enough. I don't  know. I just don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would go a long way. I messed up and am in a downward emotional spiral. I don't know what to do anymore and feel like im in a losing battle."

144,1,"The world looks so different when I am on medication, and it gives me a feeling that I have no idea what reality is. It really frightens me.

A few days ago I tried slightly reducing my SSRI dose because of annoying side effects. Two days later I had gone from doing better than I had in months to obsessively suicidal. I went from seeing myself and my life in a positive way to seeing myself as a monster. I thought about people I know being sad if I committed suicide and found myself actually trying to understand why we didn't all just commit suicide together. Life seemed so horrific that I felt like everyone must be secretly suffering this way. 

This morning I went back to my original dose and although I'm a bit shaky this evening, my earlier thoughts seem bizarre and things look brighter. But I don't understand how a tablet can completely change how the whole world looks. 

I also sometimes take xanax in emergencies and I don't know how a nervous system suppressant can make all the evil in the world and in myself disappear in 30 minutes.

All of this makes me feel like I have no way of knowing what is really real, like I'm living in some kind of dream/nightmare state. Does drugged or undrugged me see reality? I tried to talk this out with people I know but they don't understand so I thought someone here might have some insight or advice. Does anyone else not trust their grip on reality anymore after depression/medication experiences?"
145,1,No one I have interacted with in my life has had a net positive effect based on my interactions with them. It’s hard for me to consider continuing when I keep fucking things up and getting negative feedback. Really thinking about ending it.
146,1,"I feel like no one loves me. Sometimes I fantasize about dying, usually of some kind of illness that would grant me time with people who would give me attention and care solely because I was dying. I know that knowing they’d only be tending to me because I was sick wouldn’t be ideal but I mean it’s better than where I’m at now, feeling like I could vanish and no one would blink an eye. I know that’s untrue but damn I feel so unloved, like I can’t get the kind of love I want and that I can’t feel the existing love people already give me. I don’t really want to die either and so I hate even typing out this ‘wrongful’ thought, but I can’t help how I feel. Sad and a bit pathetic at this all. Sometimes I fantasize about being sick or dying because then people would give me attention"
147,1,"It's a cycle I've noticed for much of my life. A minor inconvenience is followed by something a bit bigger, then something bigger yet, and the days quickly become more tragic, one after the next.

There will be respite again, but this current crisis is proving to be difficult to cope with. I've found myself lying down and lacking the motivation to do anything but stare at the ceiling as my thoughts take hold.

I would never want life to be ""fair."" That's wishing for way too much. I just hope if this cycle repeats again it isn't even more intense. The pain comes in one fell swoop."
148,1,I'm tired of asking for help.  I'm tired of hating myself.  I'm tired of waiting for medicine to start working.  Tired of getting my hopes up.  Tired of hoping everyone in the world likes me and giving me the love I will not give myself.    Tired of being too scared to leave my house.  Help me I want to die I want to give up
149,1,"I always seem happy and ok when I’m in public or around family but when I get alone or someone pushes too hard it all comes out. The tears,the emotions , it all comes out and you can’t stop it it’s horrible how you feel like your falling and screaming but no one is there to support or help you. How you have all these battles by yourself with nothing to lean on , nothing to help or dull the pain just silent agony every night. Sleep being the only release and when you wake up you wish you were still in bed, unconscious, unable to feel for once and you go out and put on a mask so everyone thinks your ok and fine so you don’t become a burden. Thinking of ways to keep it from happening but it never works it only makes it longer and harder to endure. I just wanna sleep forever and not to wake up for once just please let me have that. Does anyone switch?"
150,1,"Because she left me. Which I predicted months ago. Because everyone leaves me. Honestly? Not feeling quite AS terrible as I’d expected. Hopefully my depression lets me get through this without too much pain, but I somehow doubt it will be that easy. My girlfriend is now my ex girlfriend"
151,1,"I haven’t felt any motivation, for anything, these past months. I feel incredibly tired and low on energy, that any chore I do just feels... exhausting. It makes me think more about how my life is getting incredibly worse and blah blah blah. 

I’m extremely stressed and anxious as I have SO MUCH work for Summer School, yet I didn’t do a single thing, because I have no motivation to do work, or anything else, really. I feel apathetic"
152,1,"tw for csa and suicidal thoughts whatever whatever in case anyone needs it

hi guys. i'm not really an active redditor, but i feel like i have nowhere else to go. i figured why not rant to a bunch of strangers who can't judge me because they don't know me. so anyways

i'm a college student [19F] and i've had anxiety and depression basically as long as i can remember.

from ages 5 to about 9 or 10(?) i was ""friends"" with this girl who was a little bit older and lived next door to me. she bullied the hell out of me and sexually assaulted me, but something in me looked up to her and i wanted to be around her. eventually we grew apart and stopped being friends.
after that my anxiety was absolutely horrible but it seemed to mellow out and then spike back up every now and then. my mom is a really caring person and would use guided meditation with me to help me calm down (though meditation gives me anxiety now)

in middle school i was bullied too, i was fatter than all my friends; puberty hit my body but not my face. i had a small friend group but all the boys in the school would make fun of the way i looked or that i was into anime or whatever. 

in late high school i was in a long distance relationship with someone for about a year that was emotionally abusing me. i didn't realize it at the time so i told him all about my childhood trauma and my insecurities; some of the deepest and most personal aspects of my life. we broke up badly. i had a panic attack so badly i threw up. i still wonder if he makes fun of me or if he told anyone about my trauma without my knowledge/consent. he would, and it scares me so badly.

after that i finally made the steps to see a therapist, but when i told her i was experiencing suicidal thoughts, she told me she couldn't see me until i was properly diagnosed, but i didn't feel like i got a direct diagnosis? i didn't visit that therapist anymore, and got a new one who really worked for me. i felt like i was finally making progress, but then i had to move away for college.

i thought i would like the independent and private life of college but i actually feel so lonely and pathetic.

TLDR; i'm so depressed i can't even bother to turn on the tv or pee when i need to. when i look in the mirror i want to vomit because of how disgusting i am. i feel like i can't trust anyone or that people who are trying to help me are just there to make fun of me or get dirt on me. i cancel plans because i feel too ugly. i don't know what to do. what is wrong with me? is anyone else's self confidence so low, you fluctuate between painful indifference and just absolutely despising yourself?"
153,1,"I don't know if I am depressed or have an anxiety disorder or both or neither. But I am a man who has been feeling angry, sad, and frustrated recently and I want cry. But I physically cannot cry. Like I don't understand why. Like I want it so bad. And that is not to say I don't produce tears. I do produce tears when my eyes dry or when I wake up. But that is not emotional crying. I want to cry but I physically can't"
154,1,"I was always a good student. I dedicated myself a lot and worked really hard to achieve great grades. I also went to two different languages schools after my regular classes were done by the day (one for english and the other for french).  Practiced sports.

Now, I'm in my second semester at uni (after quitting for a year due to anxiety) and I'm failing pretty much all of my classes. I have very low attendance so I will fail two out of my five classes due to that. I rarely attend lectures. The thing is, I don't even care. I know I'm failing but i really can't bring myself to make an effort. I don't see a reason why I should. 

University seems meaningless to me. Everything does, actually. All I do all day is lay in bed watching Friends on netfllix. I binge on junk food, which led me to a massive weight gain- and then I starve myself for days, only to repeat it all again. I have no friends.Life seems empty and I dont have a whole lot of  reasons to live. my life is falling apart but I don't even care anymore."
155,1,"I've come a long way in the past few months. I'm still on medication but I felt like things were finally looking up. I have an amazing boyfriend and beautiful parents. I was finally getting hope. But the past week has been bad. I can't help but feel like it's coming back again. I am so sick of asking for help. I think my boyfriend is getting sick of playing the caretaker role. I don't want to be a burden. I feel so alone. Rn he's going through some issues because one of his friend ( that he wasn't really close to but knew pretty well) committed suicide. I knew this person but I wasn't close at all, still it struck a nerve. I keep thinking about my suicide attempts and all the things I used to think back then. And I feel so selfish because this is clearly a hard time for my boyfriend but I'm here thinking about myself. He took care of me for so long but I'm not able to do anything for him. I'm so scared that I'll get depressed again that I'm not able to think about him. I feel like such a bad girlfriend. Depression has left me selfish and insecure"
156,1,"Hi i'm 27 M. My support network is very strong, iv been with my gf for 10 years and I have a stable job. Iv recently fixed my sleep cylce and it feels good. My problem is I have absalutly no motivation to do anything at all at any time, currently I flick between reddit and youtube videos that i cant even finnish before becomeing frustrated and just going to bed. I always go to bed thinking the next day will be differnt but its not, maybe its just a lie I tell myself so i can go to sleep. It feels like im in a groundhog day but my actions cannot change and i grow more and more resentfull. has anyone had experiace with breaking cycles and removing the anxiaty from doing things you used to enjoy? Breaking cycles."
157,1,"Exactly 2 days after returning to work after my maternity leave, my husband was arrested during a massive immigration raid at his work. It has been a downward spiral ever since. It took almost 2 months to get him out of jail, and when i finally did, US Marshals came and took him into federal jail, it took two more weeks after that to get him home. We had to move in with my mother because we could not afford to live in our home on a single income. My disabled cousin already lived with my mom, so in our room we have our son, our nephew that we have and us. My daughter is in my moms room. It has been a struggle. for the first time ever my daughter barely had a christmas. I am drowning in debt and have bill collectors calling me everyday. I quit my great paying job because i fucking hated it and took a lesser paying job that i love. My husbands federal case finished and turned out just like we thought. The catch is that it was a violation of the terms of his immigration release to be convicted of a crime...even though they raided his work...while he was working...at work...when the federal charge was the fake documents to work... I get it breaking the law is breaking the law but fuck. So we go to an immigration check in today and they detain him again. No surprise, we were expecting it. I still cried like a bitch and have been crying all day because i knew that was the last time i would see my husband, and my son would see his father for the last time for atleast 3 years while he goes back to his country and waits for a marriage visa. My son has been going through a bout of sleep regression the last 2 weeks and im pretty sure ive had just enough sleep to like not die. My daughter is only 8 but youd think she was fucking 20 the way shes poppin off with the attitude and the sass and thinking she can do whatever the fuck she wants. Im just done. My son turned 1 this past weekend. The last 11 months have been the worst of my life."
158,1,All in all I'm just a lousy waste of space. My family is probably so disappointed in me. They ought to be. I've done nothing with my life and I never will. I'm too dumb to do most things and I'm too lazy to do the few things I can do.
159,1,I can't sleep. I have been working out recently and my body feels tired but my mind can't stop thinking. It's as if I'm going through sleep paralysis but without going to sleep. I can't move my legs. It feels like most of my body has gone to sleep but my head is still awake. Anyone on? Can't sleep.
160,1,"- I do have hobbies (aquarium, video games, drawing, volunteering at local dog shelter,...) 

- I don't have any friends and I get lonely most of the time.

- I get nervous very easily especially in crowded places, social parties, and when ordering food. 

- I always care too much about what others think.

- I always care how much I please/upset others.

- I get nervous talking to a certain kind of people, especially women and teens.


*So do I have depression? I just don't want to be mistaken and I'd like to know what's going om with me. If I have motivations to do things but get nervous and sad, do I have depression?"
161,1,lately i’ve been numb to my passing days and working hard. things were going quite well until a bad day at work triggered me. i currently work at a fast food chain and i’m planning to go back to school too. i just feel like i can’t do anything. i’m not smart. i’m not good at doing anything. i just don’t know if i can live anymore knowing how worthless i am and how worthless my skills are. i want to be useful and i want to stop being a burden to others. i cant do anything right
162,1,"t's okay to not be okay my friend. Life is full of ups and downs and weird phases.

Not everything has to make sense in the moment, sometimes things click and make sense way later, and the best thing you can do is push through these moments. 

They say patience is a virtue and it really is. It teaches you so many things, without patience you won't be resilient enough to wait for the good things in life.

I believe we all know how to be patient because life throws tests at us that teach us to tolerate delays and sufferings. 

We all think we are bad at it, because it's not enjoyable, but we all know how to do it.

My 4 year old niece always says ""I am not good at waiting"", it sounds funny when she says it because she's 4, but we all feel this way. She expresses it in such a simple way, but we all truly feel like we aren't good at waiting because we simply don't like to wait, we don't like to wait through the hard times, through the delays, and through the sufferings. 

Next time you don't feel like waiting, just remember there's something good coming.

163,1,"my mum just told me that she gets really sad knowing I'm feeling down, and that she wishes she could help me, and now I'm crying (for the first time in months) because I realised that people get upset because of me. I hurt everyone I love because I'm hurting myself (not physically). my friends get upset when I tell them how I feel, my boyfriend worries about me when I'm down, my mum is currently crying because I'm crying alone in my room. none of them would be like this if I wasn't so fuckinf depressed and I hate it I just want them to be happy more than I want myself to be happy. I hurt everyone I love"
164,1,"Not only do we live in a world that categorically labels the mentally ill as ticking-time bombs, but one that also demonizes introverted behavior. At least once per week I hear my mom tell me ""I'm worried about how much time you spend in your room isolating yourself."" Meanwhile, I'm in there practicing guitar, making silly Youtube videos, listening to music I thoroughly enjoy, or playing video games. I can go for weeks without ""hanging out"" with people but my close friends recognize that's just who I am. My internal experience is just as rich and fulfilling as an extroverts when they enjoy their extracurriculars. It just doesn't help with my chronic depression and low self esteem when FOMO kicks in and I feel like I should be doing more to ""put myself out there"", whatever that means. Fortunately, with the help of therapy, I have learned to embrace my introversion and accept that I may not be the social butterfly everyone wants to talk to at a party, but that doesn't mean I can't make valuable contributions to my family, friends, job, community, etc. Not saying extroverts don't have their particular challenges, or that their experiences are any less forgiving, just that depression can compound itself with introverts in a specific way that can further isolate them from the rest of the world. Some of the most influential world leaders, scientists, artists, and entrepeneurs in history have been introverts. We contribute to society in ways that are sometimes underrated. We generally are more empathetic and compassionate, which the world could ALWAYS use more of. Stay healthy and hydrated fellow introverts, YOU ARE VALUABLE! Shout to depressed introverts"
165,1,"I used to be so suicidal and not give a damn whether I lived or died that I would go off biking without a helmet. Like, I just wanted the rush of going outside, I just wanted to feel alive, and I didn’t care if I died, so I didn’t wear a helmet.

For the past few bike rides I’ve went on, I’ve made sure to wear a helmet. I guess this just shows my shifting mindset.

I’m really glad I want to live. I actually wear a helmet when I go biking now"

167,1,"Also there's tons of peer pressure to meet people in my twenties and have a career started. I do know i need help for online addiction but realistically i don't see it ever getting better. I never had friends. I don't know what i do to drive them away. I'm different but i love myself for that. I just hate being single that's all. I see like a billion couples in nice jobs and looking fantastic. You can be hard on me and tell me if what I'm saying is wrong. Also my family is sort of abusive although they mean well, and im objectively ugly. Downvote this or whatever all you want. I guess I'm slow. I went to the library today for the first time and have been active at the gym but I'm pretty much invisible. Btw, I don't think i've ever mentioned that women shouldn't be doing awesome in careers. I'm part of a subculture I wasn't even aware of. I'm just depressed and addicted to the internet with no friends. But okay. I didn't even know i was an incel. I just can't leave my house and i feel pathetic to move out of my parents house. 😞🔫"
168,1,"I’ve been struggling with melancholic depression for a really *really* long time. I was an incredibly depressed child, and it seems like I’m either social, enthusiastic and happy *or* depressed and lost the meaning of life, and deeply.

I’ve been in a solid block of depression for the last month, and I just keep thinking about how none of life adds up to any purpose. I struggle to know how to move on in life when I feel this overwhelming horror at the meaninglessness of it all. 

I’ve been reading some philosophy, but even the “life has meaning because we give it meaning” philosophy does absolutely nothing for me. I feel like it is not “inherent” meaning.

I can’t stop being upset over things ending. I keep thinking about how hard it is to enjoy something when you know it’s going to end. It’s as if all I can think about is the ending of the thing. Why can’t I just be okay with the unknown or things ending?"
169,1,"As titled states. I told her in person and we don't talk much outside of work but I consider her a very close friend. She does genuinely care about my well being and buys me food from time to time. I've been having a really rough time between me and my girlfriend. 

It is my fault that everything is happening between us. We have a family and live in an apartment together

Long story short I feel way lower than I should. I told her I need to admit myself or I'm going to just do it. I've cried so bad these past few weeks and had a lot of mental breakdowns in front of my said girlfriend. She doesn't even know about half of the other crying. I've stood over our kid's crib crying. I'm not sure what to do. I'm so sad. 

Work is stressing me out. We are running on fumes in terms of money. I skip meals because I make 9.50 an hour... anything that comes my way goes to the baby. I love her I love living. My brain keeps telling me otherwise. I confessed to a close friend that I want to end my own life."

I bet only 5 people are probably gonna read this and 2 people are gonna comment something. I don't find anything fun anymore. I don't text anyone because I'm an outcast at school. Exercising makes me jumpy or on the edge. Video Games are all boring to me. Songs feel repetitive and my family and therapist don't help me. I get nightmares of my dad killing me in my sleep. They are first scary then I'm relieved and then I wake up at like 3:00 knowing it was a dream. My dad tells me I'm useless, worthless, a piece of shit, a shithead, and a mistake. I'm told almost daily and I have believed it for years. I've been taking medication since 4th grade and it was bumped up to 200mg in the middle of 8th grade.

I dont know how i can do that. As soon as i am going to seek help there is no going back anymore. I will be known as ''the girl that has depression''. Everyone is going to be dissapointed in me. I guess my only option now is to cut off that friend, pretend i'm all fine and just let time pass by.  I'm praying to god she isn't going to tell anyone how i've been feeling.

And that's when I realized engineering is a great career...you are considered smart wherever you go...can help people with math problems, now I'm just right here feeling so shit about myself, just so suicidal, just so dumb and useless... Engineers are fun to talk too.. she said he's fun to talk to... It's because they are curious about things...

179,1,"It’s been said before but I’ll reiterate to treat everyone with kindness. We don’t know their full story. We think of our friends and family but this extends to coworkers, classmates, Starbucks workers and strangers. 

I’ve now had a few current or former coworkers give in to their depression and it’s shocking because you don’t see that at work. 

I had a super toxic coworker who made me miserable at work but then I’d unfortunately think about her away from work because she was so evil and conniving. She finally left. But she was a big source of stress and depression. I couldn’t just leave because I need the job/career. 

We gotta look out for each other even if we may not always get along. Kindness at work"
180,1,"I don't know why I'm writing this. I feel optimistic about the future one minute, and then empty and hopeless the next. Haha maybe the void can help me? I don't know. 

I ruined my life. At least I feel like I did. I'm 20 and  failed pretty much all of my 2nd year university courses. I'm required to withdraw for a year. I wasted 8k. I have to get a job to start paying the loans by November. I'm telling myself to use this year to get better. It all feels absolutely hopeless. Is my life over? 

I wanted to major in Psychology but I failed the math credits I needed twice, so I switched to Sociology. I wanted to go onto a Social Work program after University but I feel like that door is closed now. I wanted to help teens and youth because I know how terrible depression and anxiety is. How will I help others when I need help myself? I don't even know if getting back into University after a year is feasible at this point. 

My parents think everything is absolutely dandy and fine. I've been trying to gather the courage to tell my dad about depression and anxiety. I've been struggling with this for most of my life but I'd say it's reached its worst in the last 4 years. High School was hell, I thought University would be different... I just can't handle it. I have 0 motivation to do any readings, and skipped every exam. Everyday my thought process was ""I'm going to die anyway, why does this matter?"". 

Severe social anxiety has left me trapped, everything feels IMPOSSIBLE. It takes an enormous amount of energy to do simple tasks like handing out job resumes, making any kind of phonecall, going into public, even talking to my own family is hard. Uni lectures and tutorials are hell. I don't talk to anyone but people online and my family. I was practically mute in High School and couldn't talk to anyone at Uni either. This illness makes it feel like there's no point trying and has definitely amplified the depression to unbearable levels. I don't even know how I'm even writing this right now. 

When I see people walk by, I imagine they have their life together while I'm some subhuman who let everything fall apart. I feel like an alien. Everyone is superior and deserves to live here. I feel like I'm not made for this world. I want to get better. I want to get help but I just don't see how things could ever be okay. Failing University"
181,1,"I am currently having a really depressive period and noticed that when I usually do, I develop this hate for people who have had it 'better than me. People who have good relationships with their parents, those who have always had money, had good care taken of them, do not have to cope with a mental illness. I just feel really deep hate and envy towards other people... Does anyone else have this? Does anyone else hate people who've had it 'better off'?"

183,1,"My depression and anxiety have only gotten worse as the years have gone by. I feel like even when it was there as a teen, I could at least have some days where there wasn't an overbearing feeling of me not being worthy of existing. I hate almost everything about myself. I wish I was normal, that I could meet somebody and actually have a normal conversation rather than nervously not saying much. I despise the way I look, apps like Tinder and OkCupid only confirming my thoughts about my looks. But that's not it, I don't actually know what's wrong with me. I got about 100 or more conversations on OkCupid, and not one of them ever became anything more. People usually end up ignoring me or forgetting about me, which I don't blame them for. After so many conversations, I know that it HAS to be something wrong with me. I've pretty much accepted that I'm going to live the rest of my life alone. The butchering of my only chance at love confirmed it in my mind. I guess people were right when they said not to enter a relationship until you're happy with yourself, because it hurt me pretty badly 

I've become so angry as time goes on. The smallest things seem to just tick me off and have me cursing like a maniac. Reflecting on that anger always leaves me feeling more pathetic for showing that side of myself, even if nobody is in sight. For years, I've balled up everything, I keep private about most things in my life. I sometimes feel like a stranger even around the people I care about. I don't even have a future. The thing I'm interested in, which is making music, would literally be what I'd want to do, but just seeing the sheer amount of people that I see making music that   will most likely never be able to create a career out of it are so high that I realize it would also very likely be the reality for me. Plus, I haven't even touched an instrument, I don't even know how I could accomplish it. 

I don't want to exist anymore. I think everybody hates me, but I also know in the back of my mind that there are some people that would be devastated if I were to end my life, so I'm too afraid to hurt them. Lately, I rarely brush and don't even shower daily like I used to. I feel so close to giving up. I'm terrified of therapy, I can't tell somebody this in person without tearing up, and I don't even think I could find the words to describe how I feel in person, I'd probably just lie or choke up. I'm hopeless.

Funny thing is, it's my birthday today. I forgot all about it. Another year down. I feel disposable"

185,1,"Literally all I do is work, come home, feel lonely, watch YouTube till 2AM, and sleep. These past 2 years have been pretty killer for me as I think nothing in life is meant for me. I'm a failure at school, I lost a car and I'm paying damages many months after the accident, the love of my life, the only person I ever talked to about anything and everything is gone. And it's all my fault.
I really fucking hate myself. I've already been placed in a behavioral hospital and I thought my outcomes would be pretty optimistic.

But no. Nothing. Everytime the sun comes out, is another day I have to exist. No one talks to me, no one asks about my day, just complete loneliness. Sure,this may sound like another ""vent"" post but I just hope someone kills me, or I don't see the sun again one day. I feel like nothing gets better, and when things start getting good, it ends in a complete shitshow. 

I hate everything, everyone, and most of all, I hate myself and the way my life has turned out. I'm already picking up smoking, heavy drinks before bed hoping I pick up cancer or liver failure in my future. I'm just done and tired of everything now. No reason to be awake"

Doubt anyone will ever see this so it's basically pointless and rambling to myself still for those you do read this yay cool I am noticed finally but yeah doubt that as well I'm done with life rn
190,1,"In general I’ve been insane lately, spending every last penny, drinking too much, then stressing about bills that are past due. But today I got irritated with someone I thought was hustling online, then I realized I knew them. In passing. We’ve never spoken. Then I started digging and completely get it now. Anyhow, I feel terrible on top of terrible. And there isn’t anything I can do about anything. I also think I’m coming down with a cold and also feel like my insides are freaking out. Can barely breathe for so many reasons and I can’t tell which of them are real. So then I put this new acne medicine on my face and I think I’m having a reaction because my skin is itching. Don’t know what’s going on or how I’m going to fix it. Gotta get past this week without massive fees. Then there is next week. And the week after. I might get caught up by the end of the month, but it’ll start all over again. Never ends. I’m tired and physically ache. Never seems like anything will ever get better. Feeling awful."

In the span of a few days everything came crashing back in and now, in any moment of spare time my mind becomes occupied with thoughts of inadequacies, impossibilities, and the futility of anything I do. I hate myself so much. I feel like I cant change anything and I'm too afraid to try anymore. I'm cowardly. trans stuff? mtf"
193,1,"I don’t know if this is a symptom of depression or not. Normally when someone is depressed, they lack the energy to even get out of bed and complete basic tasks. This was me last year when I was diagnosed. However, I got a part time job sometime near September and I was fine until April. Ever since April, I feel really depressed and just lay in bed all day when I am not scheduled to work. I still have energy and motivation only when I work; otherwise, I do absolutely nothing and don’t have a drive to. Can this be because working is my coping mechanism and I seek validation from it? Or is it just unrelated to depression. I hope I’m not the only one that feels this way I feel more depressed when I don’t work"
194,1,"It's been like 8 months since I've truly met depression and it's been a really poor experience to me. Right now I'm in a better state and although not much has changed since then, I did and I wanted to share a few things that helped throughout my journey. Back then I saw nobody share experiences and felt so alone. And some of you out there don't look here just to see others share their pain and are actually looking to fix themselves.

Here are the main things that helped me:

1. **Nobody is gonna help you**. Sorry. You might be able to reach out for some small things but in the grand scheme of things nobody is gonna help you at all to fix your problems. This is why people here say ""when you are depressed nobody cares"". Depression is a huge negative factor and most people forget about it as soon as they are free from it. It hurts my hurt writing this and reminding myself of what I've been through. Nobody wants to deal with somebody else's problems because everybody has a problem.  
With that being said, stop expecting help from anybody. Help yourself. You are probably expecting a person to pick you up, it won't happen. You are only by yourself and you are the only changing factor. If you're in school and you're struggling, get better. If you're stuck in your house raging at video games, hit the gym, go outside. Help yourself. Accept the fact YOU have all of the strength. I know that as much as you all hate reading this, **if you don't trust me right now you will learn it the hard way. I'm sorry.**
2. **People will let you down and you need to break away from them.** This is a huge mistake I did. I put all my faith into people because I felt so alone and wanted to do anything to get along with them. The people you want to stick with are atrocious, disgusting, disappointing. They have huge flaws that you skip over because you just want to be with somebody. Man up and become the right person instead of being like them. Accept the fact that when you're in shit people will **NOT prove worthy** and that with depression you need to analyze your environment and classify people and get away from those you don't need. Have you ever had a ""friend"" discourage you every time because **he is so much better than you at anything?** **You are absolutely fucking blind. Never compare yourself to anyone ever again.** I used to compare myself all the time with a classmate of mine, ""he is more fit than me"", ""he has so many girls in his friend's list"", ""he has so many more friends"", ""he's good at everything"". That was the dumbest argument I've ever had in my head. In reality, the guy is cringe worthy, cannot hold a proper conversation, chokes on every task beside what he is good at, and is simply disappointing. And even where he seemed better at, once I put my time and head into those things I was the same as him. **Don't let anybody discourage you.**
3. **No matter what you do against depression you will have to hit rock bottom in order to overcome it.** I could not get away from this state until the moment I wanted to genuinely die. And I could not understand a few things before learning them the hard way.
4. **Don't lose hope. It's a human's strongest tool and it's been the factor that pushed humanity to where we are. Without hope we would not have evolved to this stage and without it everybody would die.** Hope is the thing that you can always gain easily. It's the thing that you can always regain. It's simply a tool meant for us to gain strength and face life. It's always there. It's our core. Most people lose hope before suiciding but hope is always there and it's still valid. Say that you can do things, believe you can go over things, open your head and think that you have the strength to do it. **Life can turn around as easily and it went wrong and it takes very little time to happen, you just have to move yourself to that stage.** Even in the deepest of shit you are stuck in hope that you can find a way out and think of the smallest thing that can get you out. Don't lose sight of the future. Never. Ever. Again. **Hope is a genuine thing and is what pushed me this far to this day.**
5. **Being depressed for no reason is nothing but a lie and every day you wake up depressed has a clear explanation you simply are not aware of and you need to analyze your life like a math problem and acknowledge the problem.** You most likely feel depressed out of nowhere because of the things you falsely went over by. I had a stage where I would just wake up mid day and stay in my house playing video games until late night. I would be very disappointed and stressed out because that's all I could do during day time. I woke up every morning depressed not knowing the reason. I then realized the pattern and decided to change it and guess what suddenly no more depressed mornings. **There is a pattern in depression and you need to change things in order to localize the exact problem.**
6. **NEVER hold your anger inside just because you are shy or you were educated to be polite.** Ever had moments where somebody told you something that really ticked you off and you went quiet and just taught about it and eventually went up depressed? **That means you are REALLY fucking pissed off. You're angry.** But because you are holding it in yourself depression kicks in, you feel guilty for no reason. Tell that person what ticked you off. Whether it's their ego or false self confidence, tell them in their face. Let out your anger. They had no right to put you in that state and they need to pay for it. For example some classmates always let me down and discouraged me when it came to exams. One day some dude told me after I said I felt very insecure about it how easy he feels it's gonna be and laughed at me for being so insecure. I held myself and started thinking ""he is so much better than me"" ""what did I do wrong why am I so bad"". NO. I later learned in a similar scenario to reply properly. I told them how fucking inflated the person's ego is, how bad he truly is, how he is going to fall to my knees, how I've been tired of being looked down upon and that now it's my time to smash his head against the walls. My chest went from being to tight to being incredibly free and I felt so happy and energetic after saying that.
7. This is a small one but **don't cope with drugs or alcohol.** It's a costly way of running away from yourself. Not to mention you fuck your health. Don't be a pussy and face your problems instead of running away. Cope with harmless things such as music or drawing. Don't get addicted to video games either. I recommend listening to Three Days Grace, they helped me the most through this journey. How to deal with depression as a teen"
195,1,"My family has always had a history with mental disorders. But since as a child I had always been a happy child, they assumed I would come out clean. 3 years ago I lost my uncle to an unexpected heartattack. And that's kinda where things started to spiral out of control. Fast forward 2 years, I had lost the girl that I seriously connected with on a very large level. She said that I was ""too nice to her"" and that she felt ""smothered"" because I always told her how beautiful she was and how much it meant to me that she actually cared about me, because no one else really did. Now fast-forward another year, a close friend of mine died in a car accident. It destroyed me in so many ways. I haven't been the same since. This is my junior year in highschool now and it's starting to get so much worse. I've started to receive college letters now, and that just has started making things so much worse. I know that I have a future, but my constant thoughts of suicide and self consciousness has started to ruin that small glimmer of hope I had. In the past 2 months I have been close numerous times to committing suicide. Something keeps me here though, and I'm not sure what it is exactly. -Andrew My story. (for the most part)"
196,1,"The title sounds so obvious but it’s never been more apparent than now. I can’t form more than a couple coherent thoughts a day. I’m constantly tripping over my words. I feel bad and I can’t express it. My mind is so cloudy. I feel sad. That’s it. That’s the only thing I can some up with. So many minor (and maybe not so minor) things have happened over the past couple of days and it is absolutely fucking me over. I can’t think clearly and I hate it. 

Even now I know that there is so much more I want to add to this, but I can’t think of it. Like my brain is malfunctioning and the only things I can think of are “I’m sad and should die”. 

I don’t even know if there’s anything I can do about this. I just needed to put it out there. Depression has ruined my brain"
197,1,"So a few weeks ago I was with my brother and father dropping my grandmother off at the airport because she was done visiting us, on the way back to our car I saw the edge of the massive parking garage, naturally I wanted to see what I could see from so high up but when I put my hands on the rail my muscles seemed to almost jump into action, I could easily straighten my arms and vault over the oil it’s barely chest hight it was so easy, but I caught myself as my muscles twitched, but now all I can think about is looking back at my dad and saying ‘sorry about the mess, I hope whoever cleans it gets paid for their times because it will be a while’ and just launching myself off, I’ve gone through it so many times in my head that it seems more like a memory and I can’t recall anything past my face being inches above the ground, this makes me think I idealize suicide, something deep down I knew I’ve done for a while now, I just never wanted to come to terms with it, but now that I have it’s made me think of all the times my muscles twitched and I had to keep myself from jumping into things or jumping off things, this is quite scary because I’ve moved since, long long story short I moved out of my fathers house and into my mothers house between school years and I’m about to prepare for this one, it’s scary thinking I still have urges like that, I don’t know why but I thought I would be done with that by the time I moved back, I’m happy almost all the time, I have people I can talk to and I do talk to them, I have reasons to live and I want to live but I still have urges so bad I have to mentally drill it into my head that I can’t or I won’t fault over that guard rail down into that parking lot, or I have to keep myself from thinking about how the balcony would be such a easy place to hang from, why the hell am I like this? I’m happy now, I like existing, why do I subconsciously want to end myself so badly? What the fuck is wrong with me? Remembering urges"
198,1,"I like to read a lot of manga and enjoy story-writing as well as watching tv shows. The more I delve into either interest of mine, I begin to fall into a confusion of reality vs fiction. Reading manga, writing, and watching tv helps with my depression and when I’m not doing either one of those, I become unoccupied and fall into a deeper depression. But now I’m even more upset because I’ve blurred reality and fiction, making me confused and lost. Difficult differentiating imagination from reality"
199,1,"Hello everyone. I'm sure you have seen probably too many of kinda-like-this topics, but i really need some advice for people that have gone through dark times.

As title says, i think i have busted a dead end. I have encountered a situation where it is necessary for me to make a future of myself, since the finanical/family/social crysis has grown a lot for these 4 years.

I am 23 years old, i live on Balkans (poor countries), and i can't get through university. I used to blast the school before and was really good at maths and programming. I always imagined that i could study engineering, get a good job, help myself and my poor family. But as soon i moved on from my city, and to the capital city, things got really worse. I ended up getting mentally fucked up, first time at shrink, diagnosed with several mental ilnesses, a suicide atempt, a  failure on studying, and failure at life as a whole. I realise that i am a money-sink and i can't even get a grip. 3 years of medical attention haven't helped me at all. With such wide range of pills, therapies, social work, i kinda expected i will retain my will to live. But i didn't. It is a path downhill.

So, people of this thread, i am asking of your personal experience what would you do in my skin. Work a job? Study a course? Study something else? Just move away? Try something new? A lot of things contributes to my no-productivity, as i lost the mental power to study, lost the will to work, lost my hopes and dreams at achieving something, i can't even imagine anymore what could i ever become in this world. For the studying part, i could move to another city, study something easier, but i don't know will i have the mental power to continue. In our country, electrical engineering is considered the hardest (it is subjective, of course, but it is a really strict regime), so maybe i would eventually succed at something?

I just wish to have a reason to wake up at the morning. I don't remember last time feeling accomplished, lovely, rest, or any type of happy. I wish to have a stable ground to work on, and to get a will to work on. I want to know that i will for sure eat today. I don't want any type of charities or giveaways or something, i already feel guilty for my familly even supporting me. They should just tell me to go so i can be a burden no more. My only wish is that one morning i don't wake up at all, so i can stop feeling guilt and make other lives easier. I guess it is not a good way to look at things, at this situation. I know some of you have really gone through some really nasty traumas, and have recovered from far, far more deadly experiences. But right now for me, this seems like there is no way forward. So that is why i am asking for you if you could share your wisdom.

I don't think  i have any special talents. I am/was good at math, programming, and music. I have lost all my self-esteem about knowing any of these things, and i can assure, i am really useless in all other branches. I hate  the fact that multiple tests done at psychiatry clinic showed me as 'intelligent, thoughtful' , where i feel that i am unable to succeed in any path in life (work, studying, money, friends, family etc.) I hope i can wake up some day, and say: Hey, i have something to do (so i can improve myself)! Just like in video games, except that main character, well, is me.

Thank you all in advance, and i am sorry if my language was poor. I won't be offended or mad at your critics, so feel free to throw them at me. I just really, wish to improve, to get a grasp on. Dead end?"
200,1,"How the fuck do people achieve so many things in life even if they don't like it? I don't get it. It feels like I'm missing out on everything. I stay in my house all day yet I want to experience many things but I just don't feel like doing anything. I'm shy as fuck so talking to people other than some of my classmates using a fake personality during school is out of the question. All I can do right now so I won't go crazy is continue being delusional and thinking I'm somehow special and that's why I'm bad at everything except playing games and doing shitty animations in Garry's Mod (which still won't help me at all since I barely do any work). 
Seriously. How do people do anything? I don't want to work. I don't want to go to college. I can't stay productive at all."
201,1,"I do that all the time, and im doing that today., im gonna cry for times that are never coming back, in gonna cry for opportunities i missed im gonna cry because im a failure im gonna cry for people i hurt and im gonna cry because i dont know what the future holds for me, whatever its coming I'm ready. Does anyone stay awake late at night then you grab a drink and go cry in the porch late at night?"
202,1,"I have the worst luck on dating sites, I rarely ever get matches and when I do they just ghost me. I’ve only ever been with 2 people and both of them treated me like crap where I liked them way more than they liked me and I end up feeling heartbroken and unwanted. It’s not like I can just easily find someone too since getting a match on there takes forever. If I wasn’t ugly this wouldn’t have happened I just want to die honestly I can’t stop thinking about it. Going to die alone"
203,1,"Honestly I skimmed the rules so please tell me if this is out of place or if I should go elsewhere, but I felt the need to at least search for something.

I just graduated high school and got a new job, which is great. But now, when I get home I don't want to do all the things I loved. I was taking a course in game development, and was genuinely excited to do it, but now it just seems like a waste of time. I would play games with overwhelming joy and now I just can't play at all. I even bought a book about how loneliness is a natural thing and why it effects us all, but I can't bring myself to do anything other than sleep or maybe watch a YouTube video. My room is a mess because I can't will myself to clean it. I'm not normal this... Lazy... Idk if depressed or if I'm justifying laziness but this just doesn't feel right when I think about who I used to be. Have any of you been through this or something like this? If so, please tell me what worked best for you.

Thank you in advance. I'm beginning to feel less and less like myself."
204,1,"I saw it and I knew it was beautiful, but I couldn’t feel anything from it. I felt nothing. My friend couldn’t stop staring at it and exclaiming how beautiful it was, it was about 5 different colors all across the sky but no feelings came to me. I just said what I know I had to say and act like. Very bizarre numbness. Not even a gorgeous sunset, one of the most beautiful things, could make me happy today"
205,1,"its been about 2 months since i actually left the house and *walked* somewhere. it felt really nice, being able to go somewhere different. cleared my head and helped me think straight. we even went to wendy's and got some food. definitely worth the trip! hope you guys are able to do the same someday. took a walk with my cousin, very refreshing"
206,1,"So this is going to be a bit of a long one as I have a lot to get off my chest. I am a 28M ""student"" and musician (the quotation marks will be explained soon). I will begin with a list of the things that are directly on my mind and then will continue on from there. All of these issues come down to avoidant behaviours that are ruining my life.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have not been to university in 4 months as I fell so far behind on my work and was so overwhelmed that I simply stopped going. I am in my second year and did incredibly well in my first year. I explained this to the student counsellor and he said he would try to get my fail grades reversed at the end of semester. It is now past the end of semester and I have not reached out to him again to fix it, nor have I told my parents that I am no longer attending as I don't know if I can deal with their disappointment.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have acquired a few thousand dollars worth parking fines from when I first moved to my new city for parking out the front of my house. I did not pay them, then continued to ignore the piles of letters. I don't know what the total is at. I can't register my car anymore because of the outstanding fines.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have not filed a tax return since 2011 because I don't know where to begin with chasing all of that up.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly in looking at these things written down it all seems trivial and solvable, but now we run into my avoidant behaviour, and I guess chronic laziness. Regardless of how much I get pushed, or the carrots or sticks that are dangled in front of me, I always avoid uncomfortable situations. It is easier to sleep than face my problems.

I gig on weekends and am a private music tutor during the week, as well as being on welfare for students, so I'm not in total poverty, but certainly not financially stable. Performing requires me to be a social and happy person, but I've been finding my social fuse running very, very short lately. Nobody knows how dark my thoughts are. I wake up and think of suicide, if I give my brain a spare few seconds to think it goes to thoughts of putting a gun against my head, jumping off a building, standing in front of a train; it's a constant barrage. It's exhausting, and I'm constantly listening to podcasts, reading or listening to music to try and drown the thoughts out.

I feel that even if I solve the above listed issues, I have underlying behavioural issues around motivation and avoidance that will constantly undermine my ability to live well, and I don't think I can tolerate that for the rest of my life.

A guy I knew years ago killed himself over the weekend. I didn't know him that well, but a friend of mine called me as they were once romantically involved. My friend was beside himself, and was perplexed at the thought of this guy killing himself. I had to pretend like it was a shocking thing to do... Even though suicidal thoughts are running through my mind constantly.

I feel like I can't tell anyone how bad it really is, because I don't want to be treated like an ticking bomb although, ironically, I feel like a ticking bomb.

This is all yelling into the void somewhat, but I feel better after writing it. Thanks if you made it this far. I'm in so deep and I see no way out, or, have no energy to find a way out."
207,1,"I need to know .... I am losing my bearing, I am just so tired of keeping everything together. I don't even see the point in being here now. 
Please tell me it gets better. Please tell me all this work all this anxiety will lead to something. Somebody please tell me it will be fine"
208,1,"I simply just don't feel. Maybe it's numbness I don't know but from past few days I haven't been constantly worrying 24/7 and I don't know why not because I have shit load of stuff to worry about and be depressed about.
I don't feel happy either... I'm just...meh.

Anyone feels the same? Should I be worried that I don't feel any particular emotion any more"
209,1,"This is me, I quit now.

My mind is automatically set to me always bothering everyone and no one likes me, which is true at school or anywhere im at.

I do everyone a favor by shutting the FUCK UP.  I also wear a FUCKING hood at school, so no one can see my UGLY FUCKING FACE.

I hope I die soon. My life is worthless. Im sorry to everyone I wasted it. 

Im sorry I didnt take advantage of a home and bed and clothes.

Im sorry I didnt take advantage of a physically healthy body

Im sorry I didnt take advantage of getting a good education

Im sorry I didnt take advantage of trying to make friends

Im sorry for being a let down to my family

Im sorry for not being a smart hard working kid

Im sorry, I fucked my life up. 

I am worthless 
I am useless
I am a loser
I am a loner
I am an antisocial piece of shit
I am fucking cunt

I deserve to die, and once I do, everyone else will be happy or not give two shits because of the dirt and shit I am, im just going back into the dirt and shit. How I end up helping my school mates."
210,1,"Seriously, I feel like I can’t do anything at all. It’s so hard to focus, read, write, or listen to a lecture because depression just takes up so much space in my brain. I’ve officially failed another class which just really sucks and brings my motivation down to an absolute 0. I even started thinking about dropping out entirely which I don’t want to do at all. Why why why do days like this have to be so hard? I just want it to stop so I can be myself again. University feels like the big bad wolf."
211,1,"I really try my best to be nice to everyone, and I've heard I do a good job at it, I hate to be mean to people and I hate to see people feel down, because I know what it's like. When I get home and the outside world dosen't see me, I just slump in bed, my mind racing on about hypothetical situations that will never happen, and when they don't, I just get more hurt. I've helped people get into relationships, yet have never had anyone's hand to hold when I feel lonely. I've had people talk to me about their problems and I give them my best advice, and try my absloute best to make them feel better and maybe fix their problems if it's within my reach. Yet I feel like I now have noone to talk to about what's bothering me, so I keep it all bottled in. Don't get me wrong, I love to help people, and it humbles me that they come to me for help, it's just that you feel like your deteriorating when you have not a soul to do the same for you. What goes around doesn't come around"
212,1,"Hey, 
This is personal, very personal. I’m depressed. I’m suicidal. No, I’m not going to hurt myself. I’m suicidal, but I don’t want to die, I don’t want these thoughts. I don’t want to die, I want to be happy. 
It ended two years ago, the happiness, excitement, my life.
Nothing can make me excited. Not a concert, new friend, old friends, nothing. It’s like two years ago my life just walked up and left. I wake up and it’s the same thing, everyday. Work, sleep, work, sleep. It’s never ending. Changing jobs did nothing, I didn’t care, still the same old feeling. Bored. Boredom.
Driving me mad. I hate it, the constant thing always happening. Nothing changes.
I wake up and wait for the next time I get to sleep. I could sleep all day, 10, 13, 16 hours of sleep. More if it was probable. My money goes to bills, I have no money. Sometimes I’m worried I won’t be able to eat. Gas or food? Which one do I need more.
I want to be happy. I want to smile, laugh, go a day without feeling, that feeling. That shitty fucking feelings. Always there, never fucking leaving.
I’m angry, I’m fucking pissed. If I’m not sad oh am I fucking pissed. Something little, something big, doesn’t fucking matter, I’m fucking raging. I’m going off the walls, I want to rip my hair out, punch a wall, punch something, anything. Cry, scream.
I don’t, I sit there, calmly. I don’t want to hurt myself or anyone so I sit there, going about my own business. No one knows, they can’t tell. I smile and continue working and just carry on the conversation.
No one knows how bad it has gotten. I’m fucking losing it, it’s so bad. 
I’m working though, not just at my job but I’m working on myself. I’m trying everything I have to work on myself and get better. The journey has only really began. Some people deal with this at this level for 60 years. I’m ready to fucking fight for 60 years. I’m ready to fucking win life. I’m not excited. I’m not happy."
213,1,"For the majority of my adult life (I'm 28 now) I have had issues with severe energy slumps and periods of very low mood.

The energy slumps seem to be entirely random and have proved impossible to prevent over the years (I have tried everything I possibly can to solve it, believe me), and they are also a massive catalyst for my depression/low moods because when I am low energy I struggle to do what I need to do to pull me out again.  
My overthinking due to inactivity increases, causing feelings of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. I often feel immobilised for days at a time because it's much harder to pull yourself up again than maintain momentum.

A couple of weeks ago, after a long battle to ask for some help from GP, I was prescribed Citalopram 10mg (I'm on day 14) and a CBT group course on Mood Management which I start in 10 days

Ignoring my energy dips that don't appear to relate to anything at all (I've been extensively tested for any medical causes, I exercise regularly, when I'm not low energy that is, I try to get enough sleep and eat well, I don't drink ridiculous amounts), the actual depression feels quite situational. The low energy causes me to not be able to exercise, to not want to work, to lack motivation massively and feel like life is passing me by as I can't work towards personal goals, and that is what causes the depression mainly.

If I am going through a good patch or something good is happening like I'm on holiday, I am usually fine and don't feel depressed at all, but when I hit a slump I spiral into a deep depression. Obviously life has it's blah moments, I can't expect every day will be exciting...

My worry is that maybe I don't have depression and that no treatment will help me. My depression is often triggered by low energy/motivation which doctors have never been able to find a cause for. I know low energy/motivation is a symptom of depression so maybe I DO have it but I'm just not sure, as it's sort of self diagnosed. I kind of WANT to have it just so that I can get better with help, if I haven't got it, I'm worried things will always be this way

I am also aware that I am approaching the 2 week mark of Citalopram and worrying that they won't help me and I really need help because I can't continue with my job search whilst I feel so low which is making things worse for me

Anyone else gone through a similar experience? What if the drugs don't work?"
214,1,"School's out. It's been for a few weeks. And I've done nothing. I wake up, eat garbage and then wait until I'm tired again. Sometimes I skip that and just force myself back to sleep until I can't anymore. I'm always tired now, so that makes it easier. I've probably got a deficiency of literally everything. I can't stay fully awake for longer than around 10 hours. Maybe less than that. In school I'd just sleep through all my classes so I'd have the energy to procrastinate at home, but now I just sleep.

Every summer is like this. It might as well not exist for me. I essentially hibernate. Without school there's nothing for me. I don't have friends to hang out with. I don't have work. I have no desire to do anything. I just let time pass. I'm not even bored. I don't feel anything at all. It's honestly quite peaceful. I don't even dream most of the time. It's just nothing. It's like time passes by while I don't exist. And I guess I'm not unhappy with that. It's probably better than the alternative. I either hate myself or feel nothing at all. That's all my life is anymore, and I don't get to choose between them. But, for now, it's the latter.

I'm not sure why I wrote this, but I don't need a reason. Thanks for reading, I guess. Although I should probably be saying sorry you bothered to Summer."
215,1,"It sucks why I'm like this. I feel like background to friends and people I meet. Then the one person actually asks where I am when I leave and dissociate, and then I start feeling wanted. Then I talk and talk and talk to this person, open up, be happy, and then.. Flirt. That's the killer. Flirting. Now this person just wants distance. And now I'm a lot lower than usual because I got a taste of being a ""wanted"" person and was happy. 

Welp. Back to square one. Relying on someone for happiness"
216,1,"I was at my Aunts house for 4 days and I had a very good time, i felt happy because I wasn't at my mothers house and i was far away from everything that made me feel worthless but me and my older cousins were having a discussion about how my parents would have different ways of disciplining me and they would sometimes fight over it because I was a stupid kid. I feel so guilty because life really sucked for both sides because my father ended up taking drugs and ii feel responsible for it. But before life was comfortable, we had a nice house and my parents were preparing for another kid. And now my dad is alone and getting by and I have to live with my mother and my stepdad  and his 3 kids who annoy and bully me every day at home and at school, i feel guilty for everything that has happened to my family and I don't feel like I can live with myself with so much guilt, I feel if I keep going on I will hurt more people. What do I do? How can I feel better or should I just do the world a justice? Why do I feel so worthless?"
217,1,"I'd like to really congratulate my employer. I was an absolute fucking mess 5 years ago, but I've made so much progress since then. And in a matter of fucking days you managed to destroy all of that.


Long story short our company is absolute fucking shit. To the point that people are quitting without any sort of plan lined up after this, our leaving the fields all together because this place has just sucked literally all of the passion for you. We set up a meeting with management to try and make some change, which resulted in 2.5 hours of them telling us all of our ideas were shit, literally LAUGHING ABOUT IT, then saying were just lazy entitled shits and if we work hard MAYBE will THINK about giving raises. I have never been more insulted in my life.



Then 2 days later I have hand down the worst fucking shift in my life. 18 calls in 24 hours, put 400+ miles on the rig in one night. From 0900 unit 0600 we did not stop running. 21 hours nonstop back to back to fucking back, half the fucking calls are 45+ minutes away from eachother, but the dipshits at the nursing home ""accepted the ETA"" (aka we just keep telling them you're 10 minutes away so they don't call someone else, cuz what really matter is the bottom line right? not peoples fucking lives?). Held a pediatric seizure for FOUR FUCKING HOURS, because rather than figure out how to pull another ambulance into the area, nah thats too much work, lets just sit on this until the same crew we've been running all night clears up. And these fucking cockstains have to audacity to tell us we need to work harder.




Sadly private EMS is fucked as a whole, so switch companies doesn't solve anything. Getting on a fire department is basically the only escape, but don't even get me started on how pants on head retarded the fire service's hiring process is. I had a pretty solid escape plan to move to Colorado, but then I went and fell in love with a girl who doesn't want to live more than 10 minutes from her parents. Soooooooo now my only options are to leave the love of my life and be fucking miserable, or stay in the god forsake hellhole that is Illinois and be fucking miserable. Wonderful


I've lost almost all passion for my job and don't even give a shit about being a paramedic anymore, but I can't see myself doing anything else, and even if I could, I couldn't possibly imagine going back to school.



I thought I've hit rock bottom before, but I have never felt so hopeless in my life. THe only way I know how to make the pain go away is to get fucked up, and even that doesn't fucking work half the time.


Sometimes I feel like I just need s shoulder to cry on but I'm constantly surrounded by garbage human beings. My ""friends"" will just immediately change the subject to be about them, ""What was that my supposed best friends? You're having an existential crisis and feeling suicidal again? Yeah well there was a really stupid question on my quiz today and I only got a B instead of an A because of it"" Wow fucking thanks. Remind me why the fuck I tutored you all the way through medic school? My fuck parents will listen for about 2 minutes before making some smart ass jokes about me swearing then tell me to calm down. FUCK OFF. WHEN THE FUCK IN THE HISTORY OF FUCKING EVER HAS TELLING SOMEONE TO FUCKING CALM DOWN  MADE ANYTHING BETTER?


I'm just completely fucking lost, I thought I had beaten this shit, sure I had some off days here and there but I though I had made it out of the pit of despair. But I must have been a serial rapist in a past life or something because absolutely nothing can go right for me. Never thought I be back here again."
218,1,"- Feeling sad..but not quite..

- Feeling happy..but not genuine..

- Feeling angry..but not really..

Started to feel down at first, because I was being bullied and all (year 2008 - 2009), the process was suffocating. At the final year, I managed to come on good terms with my bully. On the year 2010, I started to learn how to smoke, then towards the second half of the year, I started to drink (alcohol).

Year 2011 was the worst, got caught smoking on the school's rugby field. Mom and dad was disappointed. I was treating myself as the disgrace for the family..but I continued smoking for the pleasure.

Year 2014, friends left me alone. So I started a new circle of friendship with a certain group. We played and study lots.

Year 2015, my ""friends"" introduced me to this certain kind of drugs. Meth. 

I got addicted to it for years, till my physical appearance changed from a normal skinny boy to a skeletal boy. I saw my appearance was different, so I quit at the year 2018. Sometimes even after I quit I would be shaking because of the urge to do it again. But I went on, not touching a single piece of the crystals.

This year was okay, I found a crush, but still, I don't know what to feel about it. Being in a relationship is fine for me, I think it's sweet and all. But at the same time, I just don't feel more to it. I feel less, I feel..empty. I'm happy, but I'm not sure if I'm genuinely happy to begin with.

Sorry if it sounds like a messy post..but yeah, not fully detailed, but also..I just don't know how to express it..I don't know..

P.s I still smokes..wanted to quit, but it's tougher for the situation I'm in.. I don't know..."
219,1,"So I am lost when it comes to putting what I’m feeling into writing. See since high school I’ve dealt with depression. Things got really bad towards my senior year when I sent a goodbye photo to my friends with a belt wrapped around my neck about to hang. Since then only one other time I tried to end my life and I forced my hand to either decide if I wanted to die or live or drive through a school front (I lived across the street from a school and was going to drive to a bridge to drive my truck into the lake) obviously I chose life. Which from that point I finally had a grip on things and I kept moving forward more positive than ever. Things got bumpy with a job loss and having to work with my folks while I bounced back but all in all things were going ok. Now things are going great! I’ve got a side hustle that’s doing good, I’ve got a great career, new car, and an opportunity to go to California and make 3x what I make here in Atlanta. But then yesterday happened...........after years of being composed and being the beacon of positivity and taking my blows to the chin and just moving forward I finally snapped. I was in the grocery store when I felt the mask of joy I usually wear slip and shatter on the floor. My head immediately fell into my arms and I was barely able to keep myself up. I felt like a kid who had just lost their parent in the store. And well suffice to say that when I got home things got a little dicey for a minute there. I’ve called in for a mental day from work. I may not get it excused but I know what will happen if I leave this unchecked like I did in high school and the results are horrific. I just don’t get what happened I mean I do but I don’t know why it has to happen like it does. I had a firm grip on my emotions and then suddenly it was like trying to grab a rope being pulled at a million miles per second. So here I am feeling void of any joy laying in bed trying to keep myself together......and it fucking sucks that so many years of being able to keep it in check I guess finally just cracked under all the pressure. My breakdown"
220,1,"i don’t even try to be with others, i don’t gain any happiness from anything, i sit online, wasting away, because it all feels the same, even if i don’t do anything, i feel the same as if i went out, fell in love, or even something as simple as had a good meal, it doesn’t make me feel at all, and it sucks. over the summer i’ve said maybe 10 words irl, i just spend time online because all i feel is empty no matter what i do, i create personas in my head, little fantasies to pass my time, wasting away trying to feel what it’s like in someone else’s head. i just want to live again, love again. i don’t even have the will to end myself, people who i used to care about would be sad. me? i’m not sad. i’m nothing. i’m a slate that was wiped out, a pretty cursive font, edited to become roboto. i wish it could end, but i can’t end it i don’t feel anything for anyone"
221,1,"I've been in a really dark place again for the last week, but I didn't let it affect my work until yesterday. Now its been 2 full days of calling off ""sick"" and I need to go back tomorrow, I do not want to lose this job. I thought I really enjoyed the work, and most of the people, but the last two days I just couldn't get out of bed. I'm sabotaging the reputation I've built over the last few months for no fucking reason, and I don't know how I'll be able to face my boss and coworkers tomorrow... nobody falls for this bullshit. 

I finally left my bed to eat something this afternoon (since Sunday afternoon), and I thought that would give the energy to want to get back out there... but i just feel like a lazy sack of shit... I'm ashamed of myself... I can't look myself in the mirror... how can I find the motivation to break this cycle, especially in the morning when its hardest to think clearly? I need to go to work tomorrow..."
222,1,"When I say this I mean in the sense that I feel like everybody who I interact with daily is in on it. And I don't mean this in a delusional way like that's what I believe but it just feels like everyone/everything is out to get me, to the point where it's so frequent it doesn't feel coincidental anymore. It seems like a game where I'm being pushed to see how close they can get to me killing myself.

People keep telling me be more positive and positive things will happen, and I can assure you that is straight up bullshit. I try my absolute best to just believe things will go right and they never do. I've spent 8 years on a housing waiting list to get a property. I got an email like 6 weeks back to say the details needed to be updated so I updated them (even though nothing had changed I still had to do it). They then said my account was under review and yesterday I received an email to say the new start date of my account is 15/05/19. 8 years of applying for homes to then be forced to update nothing just to have to start all over again. My anxiety and depression is bad enough as it is but when shit like this happens constantly I just don't see the point in being alive. I'll literally be dead by the time I get a house at this rate.

My sister (who does everything in her power to help me and is one of these positivity breeds positivity people) said to me the other day she doesn't understand why it's always me that shit goes wrong for. 

When you wake up every day wishing you hadn't, hating every minute you're awake, and you try to be positive only to get took round the corner and have your pants pulled down, what is the point in waking up? I feel like I'm in a spin off of 'The Truman Show'"
223,1,"I hate how it feels impossible and pointless to talk about any negative thing your going through or feeling. It feels like no one cares, their annoyed, and would rather be literally anywhere else and if you ever open up to them about it it doesn’t change anything, your still going to feel the way you do at some point again... why does it have to be this way? Talking to someone you trust about what your going through helps you feel better in the moment if it works but it rarely if ever does. I don’t want to talk anyone about the negativity going on."
224,1,"I’ve ridden myself of many of my bad habits, I’ve overcome solitude and met new and exciting people, I go out and enjoy myself on the regular, I’ve discovered my life’s passion, I’ve reconnected with my family and sometimes I truly feel happy, loved and welcome. But eventually I always return to this monster; this sapping depression that makes me hate myself, think I’m worthy of no one, starve myself, do nothing all day—I feel like I’m either waiting for change or waiting to die? I’ve tried antidepressants, weed, MDMA, some psychedelics. I can’t find meaning or value in my life. I don’t want to kill myself, and I don’t think I ever will, but the thought crosses my mind every day and, man, sometimes it sounds so appealing. I don’t know what to do, I can’t escape. I thought it was obstacles in my life I had to overcome and I would rid myself of this curse, and perhaps I’m better than I was before, in terms of the frequency of extreme depression, but I always come back. Always. What do I do? I CAN’T ESCAPE. Why can’t I escape?"
225,1,"Hey guys, I wanna start by saying that I’m a painter and muscician. Those are my talents and main hobbies. As dedicated as I want to be. Unfortunately, I’m not. I’ve been battling depression for awhile now and I noticed that I’ll get overwhelmingly large amounts of laziness and lack of motivation. I don’t know if it connects to the depression or not, but it still causes anxiety and depression. I’m also home a lot. When my friends aren’t free I’m either in my bed most of the day. Everytime I get out I get really groggy and just want to lay down. This even happens when I just wake up. I don’t know what to do about this. I know many of you are going to tell me to just push past it and force myself to get up around and that is definitely the right answer. I just felt the need to vent a little since I don’t really have anyone other than my parents in my house to talk to about it. Lately I’ve been feeling really bored and lazy."
226,1,"Everything is building up in my life and i don't have time to take a step back and calm down. Let me explain.

So i'm 17 and i'm not the smartest person in the world, I've failed quite a bit of school for one reason or another (Bad grades, parents thought i didn't learn anything, child abuse, etc.) and its gotten to the point where if i don't finish the next three years of school without failing a class i'll have to kiss my diploma goodbye. On top of that i was abused by my biological mother, who took me out of school for two years so she could abuse me. Thankfully that pain has ended, however i'm going through therapy. and my therapist says with therapy it will bring stuff up, bring weird feelings up, etc. and i'm afraid that all of this is piling up. Two and a half months of summer vacation isn't enough for me, i need at least three or four. i snapped last year at school during class once, and i'm afraid it will happen again. I'm afraid a lot of things are going to fall apart at once, and i'm afraid i won't survive.

Edit: thinking about how my life is crumbling makes me panic and i'm scared. however with each attempt at my life, is even more proof for myself that i can't do anything right. i don't think i'll survive this year"
227,1,"Feeling very hopeless and meaningless and i have no one in my life that i can go to for help or to talk to that would take me seriously and help me. I just need help really badly lately, I cry for hours because of how worthless and alone i feel.  How to get help? Where to turn when you’re feeling helpless and hopeless?"
228,1,I’m feeling a bit suicidal and need someone to vent to. I’m also here if someone needs to vent as well. Anyone want to chat?
229,1,I'm so sad and I don't know how to cope. My therapist told me I should do things that I like to cope... but that doesn't help  me. What should I do when I'm depressed / suicidal?
230,1,"I grew up in Oklahoma and I don't regret moving away, trust me I hated it there, but now I'm in Nevada and the only people I know are my wife and my roommate. I've never felt so alone before, I litteraly don't have any friends here. My depression is killing me and with only 1 person I can talk to I don't know what to do. I'm losing my mind! My emotions are everywhere! I love my wife and I love living here I just wish I had something to do or someone to talk too. I've moved across the country and now I'm alone."
231,1,"I've been in a terrible spot the last couple of days,  more likely months with brief interludes of happiness. I've been struggling to find a job that'll let me stay in the same town as my boyfriend and pay me enough to pay off my student loans. But I will most likely be moving home to leave with my parents just to be able to pay them off at the end of this month. 

As my deadline comes closer I feel this overwhelming realization that one of the only reason I'm still in this little college town is because of him. We only started dating six months ago, a month after a really bad breakup with my ex. Yet, I survived that to go on to do the one thing I've never once wanted which is to live alone. My current boyfriend's best friends hate me. I don't really hang out with anyone and to top it off I only see my boyfriend once a week and sometimes I don't see him at all. Plus we barely talk and I don't know how to handle that because I don't really have any friends.

I'm starting to think that if I don't get the good paying job I interviewed for last week, it'll be for the best. I'll feel like an absolute failure for having to move back in with my parents, eight hours away from a guy I love with the knowledge that the relationship will probably not last me moving. 

Honestly, I thought life would get somewhat better after I graduated and got out of a toxic relationship with my ex but I still feel terrible. I don't think there is anyway to fix this and I'm just going to be alone for the rest of my life after this. I've just given up hope. 

I'm sorry that this is so long but I don't really have anyone to talk to and my boyfriend had a shitty day so he he isn't even talking to me. I just needed to put everything into words. Student loans and life in general just got me down"
232,1,Lately I’ve been dreading any event whether it be happy or sad. My birthday is coming up and I’m dreading it so much. Earlier this year I told myself I don’t plan on being alive by the time it’s my birthday. While I love and appreciate the birthday greetings deep down I know i wish I wasn’t alive anymore. I feel like I need to put in this fake smile when I’m at work when in reality I dread life and wish there was an easy way out.. Faking happiness on my birthday.
233,1,"22 now, honestly just glad to still be here

edit:
thank you guys for all the birthday wishes!! the shower was really nice and I'm gonna go watch the new spider-man movie with my boyfriend and spend money on myself! it's my birthday so I figured it'd be good to take a shower for once"

235,1,"I'm an 18 year old guy, I've never been abused, in fact my mother is very supportive, but I suffer from six mental health diagnoses: aspergers, major depression, general anxiety, OCD, binge eating disorder and ADHD, as well as some minor motor tics. I've been in therapy for about five years, and I've been on a myriad of psych meds, and it's very unclear as to if they've helped at all or not. My body is destroyed by stretch marks, I'm overweight, 5'11"" and 200lbs, and I suffer from very severe acne, which I'm currently taking accutane for. I don't know if someone in my position can ever live a fulfilling life and be truly great at something. I think mental illness to this degree is like terminal illness, and my only future would be the mental health equivalent of hospice. I'm in so much pain every day, I just want this to be over, but I'm so scared of death, and so ashamed and demoralized. I've haven't really made any deep friendships since elementary school, and there's only one person I'd say I really like and value as a true friend. Is suicide worth it for me? Is there any hope?"
236,1,"I feel so numb, wanting to cry feels impossible. I can’t remember the last time I cried. Now I just constantly feel like I’ll cry, but I just can’t... Do you ever wanna cry, but just can’t?"
237,1,"I’ve decided already. I can’t believe how alone I really am. Nobody else goes for drives at 2am by themselves because they can’t sleep. If anyone knew they’d think I was pathetic. It’s sad honestly. It’s sad that I barely even have friends. Like why does everyone else get to have normal relationships with people and I can’t seem to do that? I don’t understand what’s wrong with me. I don’t understand why I need to be so alone and I don’t understand why I need to be so weird. No wonder barely anybody likes me. I’m tired of the pain and I’m tired of longing for something that I don’t even know what. I’m tired of pretending I’m okay when in reality this is the worst I’ve been in a long time. Most people don’t even have the slightest clue. Like I just want to talk to someone but what the hell do I even say? There’s no point. I scare everyone away once they find out how fucked up I am.

Maybe if I continue down this path I’ll end up in the isolation ward.

Actually, maybe that would be ideal. Then I wouldn’t have to deal with anything. I’m just going to live my whole life alone"
238,1,"Now first I want to start off by saying that I am not in a crisis and am currently perfectly safe. In the past I have had encounters where my ip has been tracked and I have been confronted by law enforcement because of potential crises. Just reiterating that it would be unnecessary now.

Thank you for bearing through that first part with me, just any encounter would just further complicate this situation.

As I said earlier I'm perfectly safe now and I'm actually doing well. In fact I'm doing better mentally, emotionally, and therefore psychologically now than I have ever before.

The issue is today I got depressed out of nowhere and seemingly for no reason. I was hanging out with friends and nothing happened, everyone was having a great time and I was too until I just wasn't. I've had a history of severe depression in the past but I've been good for years now. As, I dare to say, everyone gets sad from time to time and everyone gets moments, but mine are very low and are often unpredictable. Now today wasn't a close call or anything and it wasn't the lowest point of this year but it was probably the most unpredictable.

I spend a lot of time regretting things I've said and done and hating intrusive thoughts that come in to my head and hating those thoughts usually ends in me hating myself. But I do this almost every day and usually it results in no change to anything of my life or mood but today of all days it made me depressed.

The biggest issue is that I'm afraid of the unpredictability. I'm afraid that some day years and years from now I'll hit a low that will put me in a crisis and I'll have no where to turn in that exact moment and that's all it'll take for me to fall apart. Again I'm not in a crisis so I don't see how any action I can take now would help and I have lots of friends and family who are very supportive and I talk to about everything including my feelings regularly so I have a plan for the future. I'm not talking about any of my new fears yet as I'm still thinking about what they truly entail.

My questions, is it worth worrying about? Any suggestions?

I've thought about how I'll eventually come to my end and I've determined I'll probably die in a freak accident out of anyone's control, die as a result of something I've done (accidentally causing my death), or die because I have a crisis like I've had in the past.

Because the last seems inevitable before natural causes.

I know this whole ordeal might sound stupid to some but I've struggled in the past and I've heard of many people who have had a history of depression and been perfectly healthy (mentally) for years before ""relapsing"" (if that term works for you).

It seems like depression is an incurable disease like an std. You can make it less uncomfortable and make the symptoms go away for a while but you can never fully recover and it will eventually run its course or cause something else that will.

Any comments and suggestions would help. Even just sending thoughts and prayers this way if that's your thing.

**TL:DR** I get depressed unpredictably and I'm questioning whether or not I should worry that it could come back to hurt me bad in the future if a spout of depression does come out of no where. Just thinking out loud."
239,1,So for about a year now I’ve been experiencing a lot of abnormal things I’ve attributed to a recent breakup/new job but I’m starting to realize it’s not just a temporary thing. I won’t get into details I’m pretty confident that my mind is not healthy. I guess I’m not sure what to do or who to talk too. I just broke down for the first time last night and felt very isolated. I don’t want to tell my mom and dad just yet because they know I’ve “been sad/down”and I don’t want to be dramatic. Especially since yesterday was my sisters bday and the holiday is coming up. Is there a recommended course of action so I have all of my facts together before I tell my family? I think I’m depressed and I don’t know what to do
240,1,"You know, I have to be so aware of what I post on other social media because everyone would be concerned and ask me questions I hate answering. 

But on here i can say ""I've been so deeply depressed that I have been wanting to cry almost every night. Nothing goes right and everytime my hopes rise they get burned and crashed down the moment I let myself go... it truly feels like nobody cares for me cause they dont ever want to hear what I feel 25/8 if they start acting like they care. I let everyone in my life down..."" And nobody would say anything because I'm not gonna be acknowledged anyways. 



Nobody cares.
And that's the truth... Hah.."
241,1,"Long story short... I feel like a walking talking potato sack. I had been feeling great for a few days and now... well let's just say my mind has wandered towards my drawers were I keep my blades. I've a history of self harm from when I was a teen. It got a lot better when I hit 19. I managed to go almost 2 yrs without cutting. Then shit just hit the fan. I dont do it nearly as often as I use to but at this point it's the only thing in my life I can control. I use to talk to my sister who understands me more or less because shes also a cutter. But now that we're several states away from each other and barely get to talk I feel really alone. Even with the husband around... I just wanna stop feeling so worthless... so useless... so... ugly. I know I need help... but I can't help worry if by doing something and telling someone with the power to, that they'll take my kids away.. and I can't deal with that. I dont think I could ever recover from having them taken from me... so here I am. Writing here. Not causing harm. But feeling like I'm slowly dying inside. Why do I feel this way...?"
242,1,"I just spent this morning crying and I don't know why. I know I should be happy. I just got my degree in the field that I want to work in. And I've been proactive in reaching out and networking with people in my industry. 

But why do I still feel empty and sad? 

I don't think I'm cut out for this whole life thing. The way I see it. I've been in the protective bubble of education for basically my whole life. And now that it's popped. I have to face no longer being a student and being young. I have to face the hardships of life and all I've heard is that it's pretty much down hill from there.

I turn 21 next week but I don't even want to see the day. I'd rather just go than know that as each day passes life gets worse. 

Idk anymore. This just sucks. I didn't know where else to let it out but here. 

Thanks for sticking around anyway I've just graduated university but I don't want to live anymore"
243,1,"I'm gonna be seeing a new therapist cause the one I've been going to hasn't been helping and I've gone 6 times and my mom didn't listen to me that I wanted a new therapist until now. 

And as of tomorrow, I'll be on antidepressants, Zoloft specifically, and I'll start out with a very small dose to see how it affects me first, maybe my life mental state will improve, my life sure as hell won't but I'm 14 and have no real control over fucking anything. Finally."
244,1,"Look who's here again, posting some venting nonsense. 

Anyways, don't you guys find it annoying and frustrating when you just don't even know what you want anymore? Like, you just feel this void, and it's not like you even know how you want to fill it? Or what would make you happy? Like, I can't even say, ""oh, if only I had friends"" or ""if only I had a good job that I love"", ""maybe if could travel"" or someshit, then I'd at least have something to strive for? Or aim for? I don't know. 

But no, there's actually nothing. So you just sit there, feeling unfulfilled, not know why or how to fix it. Everything is right there, laid out in front of you. Yet nothings doing it. When my therapist or friends ask what I want, or whatever, I honestly don't know. Why am I sad? Why am I empty? What do I want out of life? What would make me happy? I have no fucking idea. I actually just want to lie down, in the middle of nowhere, and float away and never come back. Except that means I'd still be stuck with myself. Like, that's why I want to die - I just really don't want to wake up another day and feel empty or unfulfilled. I dont want to talk to myself. I don't want to be here - in this body - in this head. 

I don't know. I'm just rambling again.

I hope you're all having a much better day than I am :) Another round of rambling"
245,1,"'Everyone feels sad sometimes'
'Man up'
Why don't you just cheer up'
'You should get some help'

Please. Stop. Saying. That.

246,1,"I wake up, go to work, get home, sleep for 16 hours straight, and repeat. I don't do anything except work. I don't play games anymore, I don't go out with family, I don't talk to friends. I sleep, and I work. I haven't even seen my own father in months because I'm at work 6 days a week and just want to rest on my off day. I miss him. 


My chest hurts. My head hurts. I want to cry but I can't. I want to tell someone and get the help I need but I just can't find the words to do it.


I know. Trust me, I know. This is what adult life is. This is just what you do until you die. Everyone does it, may as well suck it up and deal with it. 


But I can't. I'm always exhausted, fighting to stay awake even after sleeping so much. I've reached my breaking point. I CAN NOT do this for the rest of my life. I can not do this for 60 more years. I'm always a nervous wreck. I'm considering quitting my job. It'll be the second time I've quit a job this year. I just want to give up.


I know other people feel like this but this isn't normal. I need help. Someone please help me.


I'm not actively suicidal, but I find no joy in life. If this is what life is then I don't want to be a part of it. I can't keep doing this."
247,1,"Almost chronically, once a month I consider ending it all and just reach a peak of sadness. Like right now, I just graduated highschool 2 months ago and have applied for 10+ jobs and gotten no word back. I feel like a deadbeat that's not going to go anywhere in life. Is this just a normal thing to happen in life or is something wrong with me? Do I have depression?"
248,1,"I always feel that whenever I'm depressed, it isn't substantiated. like there isn't really a reason for me to be depressed. I   think that I'm just being dramatic or that I just crave for care and attention.

249,1,"I hate this shit. I hate feeling empty and worthless but in reality, I ain't worth shit. I'm not worth any ones time. I hate being inside all day everyday but it's a fucking mission just to get out of bed in the morning. I hate this shit more than anything else, but happiness doesn't even seem worth chasing anymore. I wish people would get it. I wish I had close friends. I wish I had a girlfriend. I wish I had people love and care about me so can finally feel like a human being for once. There's nothing I can do. Fuck life man. This shit sucks... I'm so fucking empty"
250,1,"for the first time in like, a year and a half, i actually feel like ending my life. it’s pathetic that i’ve reached this point yet again after what felt like aeons of treatment and meds, but i’m really not surprised. the main problem is it’s a little different now than it was a year and a half ago. i no longer believe that i really have anything to lose. the only thing that’s really stopping me is that i’m afraid i’ll fail and will be hospitalized and things will be far worse than before. i have absolutely nothing in my life that pushes me forward. i’m anxious all the time to the point where i can’t even leave the house or text someone without feeling like i’m going to have a heart attack. when i’m not anxious i’m too depressed to get out of bed, and spend the majority of the day sleeping. someone who in the past caused me a world of pain recently popped back into my life and now i’m trapped in this absolutely miserable situation that i didn’t want to be in in the first place.
i just want everything to finally be peaceful for me. things just never seem to get better, only worse. i just want to finally be free of all this suffering and pain. i know that it’s inherently selfish to wish to end my suffering, as it will just lead to those around me being in pain, but would it really? i don’t know. i don’t think anyone would actually really care. i don’t have anyone close to me and i think i’d kinda just fade out. i always used to be so afraid of death, even when i tried to kill myself the first time, but now it just seems so peaceful. i just want things to be over. i guess this was just me shouting to the wind because i don’t really have anyone real to talk about this with. actually feel like killing myself and don’t know what to do"
251,1,"Hi, so all my life I have been struggling with liking my own body. It started out with me not liking my height. I'm about the average height for a girl where I live. But what ever no biggie right? I started to dislike my face. Mainly disliked how big my forehead was. But let's look at the bright side I thought. I got nice hair and balding isn't a thing in my family. Fast forward a few weeks and I get some scalp issue causing my to lose a lot of hair and pushed my hairline up a bit. This caused me to hate my looks so much that I couldnt even look into the mirror. A while later I found a shampoo which mostly fixed it but it isn't a cure. Alright.. no biggie.

 Then I started noticing my wrists and hands. They're the size of an average girl's. Lovely, another thing I can hate about myself and can't do anything about. Hey you know what since I don't like my height and size let's get into fitness! Alright cool. Oh what's that? I have a scoliosis which causes a lot of imbalances in my lifts and causes one shoulder to be smaller en lower than the other. Great... Another problem regular people don't have. But alright let's keep going I guess. Other problem with lifting is my diet. Eating enough is hard for me especially since eating is for some fucking reason a trigger for my anxiety. Another great trait I have.

Fast forward a while and I'm looking less skinny and a bit more muscular. Great. But then you figure out you might go blind someday. I got some niiiice blindspots in one eye and the doctors have no fucking clue what's wrong. It's not fair. I know that everyone has their insecurities but I have a massive list of shit(this isn't even everything) and there is no way that everyone has so much shit going on. Also got broken up with not long ago so that doesn't help either. She wasn't the kindest to me but I was in love and a dumb fuck

I'm not a violent person but all this stuff just stresses me out so much that I want to either hit myself or break something. I feel so weak and defenseless.  I hope you're doing better than I am. Good luck.

Edit and stuff; Besides all of this I'm thankful for my friends being there for me. They always want to help and keep me company truely love those guys. I hope I make them happy and not rub too much of my misery off on them. I just want to see them smile. I am extremely unlucky. [Body image]"
252,1,"At this point, it isn't even the depression that is ruining me; it's the loneliness. I feel lonely 24/7, and I feel as though I'll always be that way. I feel like I'm too ugly and simply not good enough for somebody to love me. I feel like nothing I can do will make me appealing to girls or guys or anybody. I feel trapped in my isolation and loneliness, as well as a prisoner of my own mind. It's a mentally taxing and miserable existence. It's hard to enjoy things when there's nobody there to enjoy then with. The best way to describe loneliness, which I got from somewhere, is being the thirdwheel in a relationship, but there's no relationship or two other people. That's the best I've ever heard it described. I wish I had somebody to go on dates with, somebody to spoil rotten, somebody to kiss and give all my loving to, somebody to share my deep thoughts with, somebody to take late-night walks with when our anxiety gets the best of us, etc. However, I never had and may never will have that. And let me tell you, it fucking hurts. But I'm sure you guys and gals know what I'm talking about. It's ironic; we are all together in being lonely. If that ain't an oxymoron, I don't know what the hell is. Anyways, I'm gonna watch YouTube until I somehow find a way to fall asleep. This was just a little rant to put my mind at ease. Cheers. This loneliness is unbearable"
253,1,"This scale I've used since January of this year when I came very close to suicide. It's to show how serious my current situation is, both mentally and physically. And how close I am to death. 

It is based on the DEFCON level the US uses for the probability of nuclear war, going from 5, safe, to 1, war. 

For me, 5 is all is good, while 1 is that I'm dead. I will never obviously know if I ever do get to 1. I've only got to 2 twice, January, and last month when I got seriously ill.

Currently I'm at 4. 

It helps me get a grip on how serious things are and to try and calm down and double up my efforts, puts a sense of scale to it. 

The closer I get to 1 the more work I put in in trying to get myself back up the scale. 

Maybe it's something that can help you all too.

5 is safe, life is good.

4 is that life is alright, but there is stuff going on that requires close attention and vigilance is needed 

3 is used when I'm in a bad depressive episode, and I am undertaking self harm and stuff like that, proper action must be taken soon to ensure this doesn't spiral out of control. 

2 is used when I am literally on the brink of death, and signifies a very serious situation that needs to be seen to immediately. 

1 is me dead. I use a scale to evaluate how close I am to death."
254,1,"I don't really know what to put here but here we go. I think I just wanna start off by saying that it's no ones fault but my own. I've been sad for long as I can remember but my sadness comes from the unkindness I see everywhere. I can understand that that people would rather look at them selves in a mirror than see the troubles of another. I get it that it's more important to look out for yourself. But  It's strange how my heart has always said give your whole self but I've never meet someone to do the same. I'm tired of throwing my self at everything to see nothing in return. I'm tired of this worlds unkindness. Its weird because I've thought about my future and how if I kept on living and everything went perfectly it wouldnt cause me to feel anything different than if I died now. Getting everything i wanted out of life died when i was 18. Everything else was a joke of love. Goodbye and good luck, I hope you'll see a different light in the sunrise. Nothing but a farwell frome a lurker of hope. I'm tired."
255,1,"First some background that will be useful when you get to the dog walking part:
 Our cottage driveway goes right through a forest that is full of mosquitos and other shit bugs. 

The farmers store belongs to a a neighbour, jack, whos one kid is dating my sisters friend., Megan,  I met Megan on a trip to the DR last year. She is very great and always kept me entertained. I throughly enjoyed spending time with her and I can’t wait for next feb so I can see her again.  Jack also has other kids that typically man the store at the end of the driveway. 

Today was the last day at my cottage until the end of July since about 2:30pm yesterday it has been just my parents and I. They typically do work outside and I’ll sit back and do nothing since it’s vacation. While today they went into town for like 5 hours. 

I got bored of playing video games. I was yesterday and I struggled. I have been sad for like a week and have been battling it by keep myself busy with mind numbing games. Today I snapped and realized in about 3 weeks I’ll be up at the cottage again for 2 weeks and it’ll again be my parents and I for most of the time. I need to make cottage friends. 

So at first I took our canoe out. Paddle 15 minutes pass neighbours to see if anyone is out on their docks. Turns out no one is up here in a Tuesday after the long weekend. So I went back inside all sweaty and shit (eww sweat). Played some games another hour before this time deciding to walk my dog to the local farmer store. 

I got about a block away before my parents came back and tucker (my dog) went nuts and didn’t want to continue the walk. So I didn’t even get there. 

I came home and realized I can accurately predict my next year before I leave for England for8 months. 

From July 2019 until August 2020 I will follow this schedule

Work/school, come home nap, Netflix/video games, dinner, Netflix/video games, sleep. Repeat

In feb for a week I will be going on my annual mission trip to the DR with a bunch of people 

At this point I would welcome being shot just because it’s something different. Sure it’s gonna hurt like hell but at least it’s something new. I cannot take having no friends and nothing to do I got so sad today I actually decided that walking through a mosquito infested semi forest was fun"
256,1,"I'm having a fuck ton of anxiety, more than normal. I cant get stuff out of my head and I cant sleep it off. So here I am at 6 am, wanting to die even more than before. Can't sleep"
257,1,"I can’t believe my life turned out this way. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live like this."
258,1,"I made a mistake and said some things that I regret to an ex. I couldn't move all weekend because of guilty feelings, and so I bailed on a buddy that was throwing a bbq. I texted him about an hour before I was supposed to be there saying I wouldn't be up, and I had to leave work early because I wasn't feeling well. All true. Today I'm getting passive aggressive texts about my ""miraculous recovery"" because I went into work today. Fuck you dude. I'm not comfortable telling people I'm depressed as to why I'm not feeling well. My other friend, who I said the exact same stuff too, took everything in stride, and asked me how I was feeling today, but I didn't tell him I was battling either. It's almost like one friend accepts ""I'm sick"" and cares about me w/o question, and the other a-hole only cares about himself. Seriously who is so insecure they question whether or not someone is truly sick. Why does it matter if I have a fever or I'm just kinda down? Are you so fucking oblivious to the human condition that you can't imagine someome being sick outside of some cartoonish image of a thermometer sticking out of their mouth. Society has a serious problem with recognizing depression as a sometimes debillatating thing. Friends"
259,1,"I see so many people struggling and fighting for having a better life, to fight a disease so they don't die and leave the loved ones behind. But here I am, feeling sad and not having motivation to do anything, having suicidal thoughts a lot of times and just feeling like nothing will be better. I hate myself for feeling like this and I hate even more this feeling of just wanting to end everything when there is so many people fighting to live... Just needed to take this of my chest. I feel selfish for feeling sad / having suicidal thoughts"
260,1,"Sorry for formatting. Still relatively new. Going to do this like a list. Not ordered on how extreme it is.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 1. 

I carry too many people through shitty points, and it feels like I'm in the middle of an enormous shitty point that'll never end.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 2.

Motivation seems like it never existed, and I never have or will be happy.

Reason 3.

I'm violent from constantly feeling like shit, and being violent makes me feel worse. It's hard for me to do anything at all."
261,1,"This is probably a terrible thing I’m doing because it’s because of this new cute girl at work. I don’t feel good about how I look or feel so I want to get a better body for her, but I’m terrified, no, mortified that she won’t want me and I’ll just give up and go back to my degenerate, lazy, druggy ways. I just hope that no matter what happens I’ll stick with this. I’ll actually make a change. It just doesn’t my modus operandi unfortunately. So I started working out last week."
262,1,"Got fired last Thursday, my birthday was this last Saturday. Now it's Wednesday, my old job was menial but I liked it because the repetitive work either kept my mind completely off things while trying to focus on another or I could really fixate on it if I just wanted to make myself feel bad. Now I just sit up the entire night and think about things, I had half decided on calling and asking for a divorce still haven't decided. My dad should be here in a few hours, hopefully by then I'll be sleep. Can't sleep"
263,1,"I'm starting to really fall for someone. We hung out and talked semi-seriously for the first time. I remember her telling me that she really likes me and that i'm really nice or whatever. My mind was racing with thoughts of how she doesn't know the real me yet and that i'm going to mess it up and that this is all a lie and she doesn't really mean what she's saying. All of this internal nonsense made me come off like a douchebag. I care for her a lot but this constant drawl of doom is overshadowing everything that I do. I'm having trouble remembering simple things because i'm too laser focused on how much I dislike myself.

Knowing I am in control; that my thoughts aren't my own; that it's okay, aren't enough to quell my anxiety. I'm afraid. I regularly meditate and feel entirely alleviated of external anxious habits, but my brain has become a mess. I can't socialize normally unless i'm high or drunk, an unfortunate trait of mine which my new romantic interest has taken note of. I'm scared, but capable. I need someone to shove me off in the right direction. I feel totally off. I'm petrified of nothing and everything. My depression is persisting into every aspect of my life, im afraid."

265,1,"hey, i’m gonna make this post shorter, but i would really like some help. or advice. anything. anybody. please. i don’t know what to do.

a few months ago, i moved away. not that far, only a few cities away. i moved away from all of my friends and boyfriend during the middle of the school year. going to a new school was extremely difficult. i made no friends whatsoever and avoided social interaction with everybody. i felt isolated and as if everybody hated me at school. sometimes i was teased by others, which also made things worse. ever since moving, i completely changed as a person. i became super depressive and suicidal. i feel so alone. i have never ever had such negative thoughts before. not like this. it’s summer, and i am going to highschool now. unfortunately of course, a different highschool from all of my friends. i still talk to all of my friends through social media, but it just isn’t the same. i do go to my boyfriend’s house every now and then, but it still hurts. i have nobody. i don’t want to go. i’m so worried about the future. more-so i am worried about my boyfriend leaving me and meeting new girls during highschool. that’s my main issue. i thought about killing my feelings so i wouldn’t have to be worried about him, but i am not sure. i am afraid and i don’t want to be jealous. i am so anxious and stressed about highschool. i can’t be alone again. i have nobody here with me. this distance is the worst thing ever. i don’t know how to stop being sad over the move. it’s been months and i still feel like shit. i can’t get over it. i’m too weak. i’m worried out of my mind. somebody please help me. any advice please. i can’t “suck it up,” it’s so fucking difficult. i’m so lonely. i can’t do four years alone of school. i hate this place. i hate it all. the stress is getting to my head and often i think of ending it all so i wouldn’t be so sad anymore. it really hurts. i don’t see a purpose in life anymore. 

tl;dr - i am immensely unhappy over moving away from everybody i loved. i have suicidal urges often and cannot be happy, i need help or advice to make things seem better before it gets worse.

thank you. moving depression? please help."
266,1,"I’ve had enough, I’m sick of going to therapy and only seeing my problems get worse with treatment. I lost my girlfriend, my closest friends, and just the other day even my parents forgot my birthday which was coming up. I’m running out of options to keep trying, I know I’m a young guy with plenty of life left to live but who can give me that speech before it’s just that mind dumbing speech that you hear every time? I get that yeah one thing shouldn’t bat you down but it does, you get up you try again and I do, but get hit back down. My relationships were all up and down and maybe that’s what built me up to this point, my friendships starting to crumble as everyone’s schedules become more complicated and they have bigger priorities over you, I understand that. But the thing that hurt the most, the love of my life, the girlfriend I cherished and did everything for that’s helped me left me, got someone else. And here I am standing here thinking I’m better alone but every time I’m alone I question if that’s the case then why does everyone just leave. Life is full of ups and downs and I’ve been through enough to learn that and I’ve been therapy and on medication to know benefits and the disadvantages of going through the motions. I just think with this situation I’m in it’s a dead end. On the outside it looks like I’m fine, “Oh he’s doing great, he has a good job, getting ready for school, he just doesn’t talk as much as he used to, oh but he’s losing weight” I’ve reached out to everyone, I tried talking t my parents about how we should’ve ate better and they kind of just went along with it because now the only thing keeping us together as a family is what we eat and the place we stay. I’m rarely ever home, I’m either working or somewhere peaceful so I don’t cry my eyes out questioning my life’s existence. I don’t know sometimes, I question a lot and I try talking to some people what they think the true meaning of life is and every time it’s never the same answer and maybe that’s the thing that I have to follow something else, but at the end of the day I know what truly makes me happy. And I don’t have it and I won’t anytime soon, and I’ve waited my whole life battling this mental disease trying to find out if I’m better only to be told every fucking time I’m the piece of shit that people scrape off their boot. Sorry, but the only thing I need is just what I used to have and I’ve learned a lot that you can’t chase your past but it was so much better, I was loved, cared for, I gave love, I have care and it was enough, I wasn’t looking for confirmation but I was looking at someone that I could see waking up to everyday and do nothing but smile at them every second they’re around. Now I don’t smile, my friends give me shit when I don’t get out or don’t take off work for them, or question why I don’t pay for their food when we go out. My co workers see me as an asshole and impatient because I don’t like dealing with their childish acts of he said she said drama and what not. I like to think I was a kid for long enough but maybe growing up kind of just became the boiling point and now it’s all boiled over and I’m dealing with it now. Either way, I’m sorry for whoever has to read this emotional rollercoaster of my feelings but I don’t even know what to do anymore. And I have a knife that I’ve used for the past 3 years, it kills me (literally and figuratively) that I have to use it to feel something in my life. I’ve already reached out, and if I tell anyone the real truth I’ll be hospitalized which when it’s against your will it doesn’t really help, I have 2 therapists and I just wanna figure things out but I don’t know when. There’s so many things that go on with life, how people live, how they die, so many factors and it feels like I have all the negative ones. Well I guess that does it, I just want people to know at least I tried and if I give up it’s not that I wasn’t strong enough, it was that I was just too tired. After everything I’ve been through I’ve had enough"

I was in the process of moving but I also need to find a job and I start school again in the fall...

I’ve just never felt lower in my life and I need some advice on how to keep it together.... I lost my job a week ago and was barely holding it together until I saw that a girl from high school made her Broadway debut this week and I can’t even afford to buy tickets to see her."

For more context: I sometimes just don't eat whole meals or spend the entire day having only eaten a granola bar and a slice of pizza. It's not that I'm purposefully not eating, but I just don't have the desire to because eating just feels like too much effort sometimes. I have no allergies and will try most things, especially if I can cover up any unwanted flavors or textures. Eating while depressed"

I know I am degenerate due to my appearance and sexuality and sometimes I really do wish I was just.....normal. I wish I was like everybody else. I avoid mirrors at all costs, due to them reminding me of what I truly am. Once I leave my family, I will be forced create a new life. My family won’t accept me when they figure out the truth and I’ve made peace with that. I used to cry at night, wishing to be normal and not go against my parent’s wishes. I cried thinking how I disappointed them by my existence and how much of a burden I was due to all my medical problems growing up. I have always, since I was a child, wished I was normal. I feel cursed. It’s pathetic, really. It truly doesn’t get better. My brother is so lucky he was born and raised healthy and normal. He is the star in a family, a man of God. Empty"

Who would I cry about? 
My brother
Why?
He's my family. The only person I have left besides mom and dad, and they don't have much time left on this planet with me. I may be insensitive or bitchy sometimes but I have feelings that could easily be hurt. 

Even though I never spent much time with him, and now he's away for college, we still do have some good memories together, back when times were happier.

Hey big bro,
Remember that one time you took me to the movie theatres to watch Boxtrolls? Or that one time you ordered us McDonald's or a fruit salad (by the way, that fruit salad was the best thing ever)
Or that one time where you played ball with me with that ball that looked like a watermelon. Or when you bought me my first Starbucks coffee. Or all the times I asked you to bring me some candy when you got home from work. Or when I cried when dad left for work. You were there for me. 

My brother took the time out of his day to spend it with my undeserving spoiled ass. Although it wasn't too often, it was more than enough. He made me happy when I needed it most. Without him, I wouldn't be here today.

Hey big bro,
Remember when you stole money from my piggy bank? 

I forgive you. I now realize you needed it more than I did.

Remember when you hit me because I called you a retard?

I'm sorry. I deserved to get hit.

Remember when i drew a shitty drawing on your bedroom door with a marker?

I'm sorry.

You are the last person I wanna see suffering or dying. But even if it came to that, even if I were to sit next to you on your deathbed, I will make sure to spend every second with you until your last, dying breath.

Hey, Tof, wherever you are, if you read this, I just wanted to say thank you. For everything. I'll be waiting for you when you come back home. I don't know what it feels like to lose someone"
273,1,"I'm at a loss of what to do. This year alone, I have lost my girlfriend, who was the love of my life, she decided to leave me because of her anxiety/depression, I had to surrender one of my dogs to the shelter because he completely destroyed the furniture in my house because I didn't have the time to give him the attention he needed, I almost shot someone on duty (I'm a deputy sheriff) because he pointed a shotgun at me (he dropped it before I completed my trigger squeeze), and I had a good friend pass away yesterday afternoon. How much heartbreak does a person have to endure before things start to get better? I'm tired of being depressed. This year sucks."
274,1,"I lost all interest in the job im doing right now. There is nothing left, I no longer wish to live, no hope for the future or will to exist. I had this before but there has been some hope. Now i feel like this is final. I will probably wait for last pay check, clean my room properly and write a good bye list. You can't fix something that doesnt exist and the person i used to be is dead for quite a long time. Sorry for formating and grammar. writing on phone and english isnt my native language. No more fight left in me."
275,1,"I've been struggling with depression for about 8 years now and I honestly just can't do it anymore. Every day it gets worse and worse, I can't remember the last time I felt happy. I haven't been able to work, sleep, have fun, get into college, love, anything. It's just tearing my relationships apart and honestly I just don't care anymore. I want it to be over so badly. I've tried therapy, I've tried medication, the only thing that works anymore is alcohol and being 18 I can't reliably get my hands on it. I just want it to be over. I want everything to go away. I want to die. Someone convince me not to kill myself"
276,1,"I'm sick of not being able to do anything because I'm so tired and can't focus. I'm sick of me drinking all the time thinking it would help. I'm sick of wanting do to do meth even though I've been clean for years, but the only reason is because I am in a different country and don't know who to talk to here for that shit. I'm sick of having to take all these pharmaceutical cocktail of pills that's suppose to help but they really don't do shit except maybe numb me out even more. I'm sick of having to see a psychiatrist and therapist. I'm sick of feeling like this. I'm just so sick...

When does it all end?


Till death...? Maybe is time I'm so sick of this shit..."
277,1,"I am not sure where to begin.

&amp;#x200B;

I will start with who I am. Indian born but moved to America when I was a baby then moved to Australia. I have Australian citizenship, completed my higher education and am currently undergoing a university degree at a decent uni. I also managed to get an internship at a top American IT company.

&amp;#x200B;

I severely hate Sydney. The infrastructure is bad. It takes me 45 minutes to drive 15km in the morning and on the way back. To get to uni it takes me an hour and if I miss a train, then I have to wait for 20 minutes just for the next one. The metro is now there but that's not near my area. The food is bad and overpriced. The restaurants in the CBD have pretty much the same menu. Shopping centres close at 5pm so no going out on a weekday really except on Thursday where it closes at 9pm. I also have that fear that I am going to get attacked just because of my race. There have been cases where Indian students got beaten up and that there was a lack of policing and reaction in this. I did not feel this when I was in America but I left in 2008 so it could be different. IDK about this opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

I miss my family. Each year I go to India to visit them , I end up extremely miserable when I come back. I see how good my cousins have it atm. Except for one but that's because his boss is a \*\*\*\* but my other cousin loves her job and they work in the same industry. They get to go out to eat so much. The food is so damn good that every time I go to visit. I demand they take me there. Now I know I am comparing my life in a developed country to a developing country. I realise that. I am not delusional. But I just feel intensely lonely and I have noticed how much better it got. I used to hate the country before 2010 but I noticed so much about how it improved and I just question like why am I living in Sydney.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate my job. I hate the work culture of it. My manager is the biggest micromanager every. In every meeting I constantly get interrupted when I talk like he tells me to say this first even when I plan what to say and planned to say it. Then he talks SO GODDAMN MUCH. He has talked like 30 minutes at once. He just basically repeats the same thing over and over when he has his rambling or saying it in a different method. Then the work I manage to complete it easy but then I complete it in a day then I have nothing to do for a week. I basically come to the office just to sit on reddit or whatever cause I have nothing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have friends. I do have a lot of friends but its not as good as it sounds. A lot of them the same race as me like in the region of South Asia. So like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka. They basically hate being their race and are the biggest self loathers. They make me feel so depressed just to be my race. An example of whom im gonna quote ""these white chicks look at us as rapists. We're gonna stay virgins our whole lives."" This kinda reminds me how I am probably gonna die along. Then they are saying how the country never achieved anything and how we are all pathetic. They're basically potential incels and its killing me. Then I got friends who are the kind to insult intelligence and put people down now matter what the intelligence. They are basically insecure.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I am not one of those who are ""spoilt"". I control what I eat and control how many hours I spend on the Internet or gaming. Same for Netflix. I have self-control on being ""satisfied""

&amp;#x200B;

If you read all this. Please let me know how I can stop feeling miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: indian living in australia,  hate living in sydney, miss my family in india, hate my job and manager, my friends make me feel miserable, I don't consider myself spoiled, probably gonna die alone I am so fed up of my life and life in general"
278,1,"I cried tonight for the first time in about 8 months. I felt so terrible at everything. Letting it all out though, it really helped me rest a bit. I know it's stupid but I was watching Jacksepticeye's video on a game called Missed Messages. The suicidal undertones and self help through other people ideas were enough to really give me a good little nudge off the edge.

I feel so helpless and have no one anymore. I dont understand this but I know that nothing can be worse. Some kind words might help but what I really need is a fucking hug. I cried for the first time in months..."
279,1,"I failed to perform a basic task that a normal functioning human can do. I can't eat, I can't sleep properly, I can't focus in class, I can't communicate well with other people, I can't get out from bed, I can't do anything right.

Please end my suffering. I've been this way for as long as I can remember. I've been suicidal since I'm 13 and somehow it's just get worse even though some people lies to me saying it's get better? It's so fucking hurt. Nobody warn me about this pain in my head and chest would suffocate me. I failed as a human being"
280,1,"Coming down from being extremely happy for the past few weeks. I knew this was coming, but don’t think I can handle it lasting too long. Let’s hope it’ll only be for tonight. high highs low lows"
281,1,"I just feel like shit 24/7 everyday i just wanna die and be left alone but i have to go to work but i just said fuck it today because ""i have the flu"". I have not been this depressed in a long time I called out of work today"
282,1,"It will be my 18th birthday in 2 days and I have no friends so there won't be a party I can't even go to a pub or bar because I don't have ID. The 4th July my birthday will be the most depressing day of my life. It will be a miracle I won't kill myself.

Edit: it is currently 8:34 AM and I already drank another wine. I'm still drunk, why are birthdays so stressful?

Listening to happy 18th birthday in YouTube now. I can't stop feeling delressed but I'll try to pretend I am happy. 18th birthday soon, will be most depressing day of my life"
283,1,"For a while everything was going so well.  I forgot what it is like to feel down.  Everything in life was a gift.  Everything was beautiful.

And then, in one evening and a nice evening spent with friends, everything just imploded.  Not in any physical or apparent way, just inside my mind.  I felt so alone.  So much like a stranger in the world.  Like I do not belong anywhere, I don't feel good anywhere, I have to identity and no place.  Life is beautiful but I just can't fit into it.  Doomed to be a stranger forever. Feeling so alone and out of place"
284,1,"As someone who has depression, weekends and holidays are one of the worst things for me as I don’t follow a set routine in them. That’s why school really helps me control my mood, because I am much too busy with my schedule to focus on how I am feeling.

The summer holiday is coming up (yes, i haven’t started it yet) and i’m worried about how i am going to cope without a routine such as school. I don’t want to have a depressive episode for 6 weeks straight because it’ll just ruin my summer break which is meant to be fun and relaxing.

Does anyone have any tips or ideas for me to try? Thanks. Depressing summer holidays?"
285,1,"They only care about my job. Two weeks ago I had an accident and broke my elbow. I've been recovering since that. The bandage is off but I still can't bend or stretch and there's a lot of muscle  damage that still needs to recover. 

At first I was glad that I could stay home at my parents' house, but after the bandage came off it turned into a literal nightmare. My mom and dad keep pressuring me to get back to work. My dad silently judges me, thinks I'm faking stuff just like he thinks my depression isn't real. My mom is actually the aggressive one, constantly telling me that I'm going to get fired because I don't show motivation towards coming back to work.

I feel so worthless. They never ask how I'm doing. They only ask me when I can go get back to work. They don't take my pain or emotions seriously. Honestly idgaf if my job fires me because I'm so damn tired and my arm still hurts so much when I try to do something. 

My physiotherapist is telling me not to work because I can get permanent muscle damage. But that's not stopping them. 

You know what maybe I am worthless. Maybe that's why they act like this. It doesn't matter if I'm in pain. I just should keep my mouth shut and live this hell. My parents don't care about me"
286,1,"  
Are these people trained to help  switch something in your brain, or will they just tell you the usual suicide prevention greatest hits (""you're not alone"", ""things will get better"", ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"", etc.)? What can you expect when you call a suicide prevention hotline?"
287,1,"I have started to realize that I had started to display signs of depression from childhood.
I was extremely moody, not 'cute' or 'adorable', didn't smile or laugh, I wasn't a friendly kid who was ready to play with anyone , most of my childhood photos have my best frowns and I look spaced out, I also wasn't ready to  bond with guests or people who come to visit me as a kid..... Do you feel like you have had depression since childhood?"
288,1,"Yes, with time things get better, I hear it all the time. But one day I’m fine, the next I’m contemplating ending my life. Now I just take sleeping pills and go to bed a 7pm because when I’m sleeping I’m not thinking about it all. I am on a small dose of medication and I’m debating upping it. How do you get over a person that cheated on you? I have clinical depression and I need to pointers to get through it."
289,1,"I have watched what I've done rip apart my family, with cheap thrills and deep spills I've lost everything I thought I had gained. I just want to be remembered, without a cause for grief or greater casualties, but it's hard to be forever, when it's all been a waste and you're living in this made up haste. We don't want to be forgotten, so how do we live if we just have to give it all away. These days go by so fast, how can we make these moments last forever, soon it will all fade away, gone so gone into the gray. Regretful end"
290,1,I've lay in bed for three days now. The only thing I've really thought about is how much I want to die. Today.
291,1,"I've suffered severe depression since childhood.  It's like a dark cloud that picks and chooses what days are brighter and what days are long and dark. The last 4 years I've become completely isolated,  no friends to talk to. In a relationship and honestly it's one of the best things that has ever happened to me,  got a beautiful son out of it.  He is my everything, its very exhausting especially now that he is 3 &amp; a half.  Im trying so hard to function and have a normal life.  Yet I can't seem to get out of this dark ""cloud."" Finding myself losing interest in everything and feel as if I'm failing at everything,  being a mother,  a partner,  a daughter,  the list goes on.  It's like I know what i need to, it's right in front of me, just out of reach.  How do I get out? How do I finally be free of this darkness of depression that's got its grips so tight around me that it's hard to breath, think, sleep. I don't feel like I'm good enough for anyone,  anything ever.. I don't want to be here anymore, yet I have to be here.  For my beautiful son.  I wish I had friends,  yet everyone disappoints me,  people's standards are just not compatible.  It's just me stuck in my head, all day everyday. Getting the best of me, the dark monster that's always looming over."
292,1,"I don’t know if this is the right place to write this but I’m going to assume it is considering this has made me depressed. I’ve been through depression before so I caught on to the symptoms slowly creeping up on me again. I’ve been in a relationship for two months now and it’s turned me into this. I cry myself to sleep every night thinking about him. I oversleep because I know I won’t be waking up to a text from him anyways. I get so envious of couples that I see holding hands in public. I’ve been starving myself and overeating. What pisses me off is I don’t know how to word how I’m feeling so I isolate myself. I want to talk to him but am too scared to shoot the first text because I fear I’m annoying him. I barely talk to him to annoy him though but when we do talk, I feel like I talk too much. He told me that I like to ramble already anyways. Which kinda hurt and felt criticized. I finally built up the courage to at least ask him how he’s doing yet being on Facebook liking posts (I get the notification from him liking my post) is more important to him than taking 5 seconds to reply to his depressed girlfriend. He doesn’t know I’m depressed because I lied to him saying I’m okay. I rarely ever get to see him for him to take notice anyways. I have a gut feeling that he used me for sex and these thoughts just make me feel more depressed and anxious. I’ve been used for sex in the past and closed myself off for a long time after it before I met him. I’ve also been in happier relationships before too so I know how it’s like to feel wanted. Unfortunately each of my relationships keep going downhill this, reaching rock bottom because I love him so much yet I feel he doesn’t give a single shit about me. (There’s some cursing)"
293,1,"I've been trying so hard to stay strong for my boyfriend but we keep getting hit with bad news and it's breaking me. Currently under investigation at work for a stupid mistake I made and might lose my job. If I lose this job I have nothing keeping me in the city I live in and would end up with me leaving my boyfriend and the new flat we just moved into together to go back home. He cracks so easily and I'm trying to be a rock for everyone I know but I can't do it. For so long my depression has been emotionless and dead but now I can feel everything and I just want the pain to stop. I don't want to erase the past 2 years of my life but I don't want to have to stay here and be reminded of how much I fucked up every day. We're skint and in so much debt, none of my ""friends"" here even care about me and everything's too much. This is the second time I've vented everything today and it's not helping. I find out in the next 48 hours if I'm being fired or not and if I am I'm going to run away for a few days and think about everything and most of me really doesn't want to come back. I'm at such a loss. Things keep going wrong"
294,1,So I’m back again with another question if you guys can give me some insight. So I’ve explained in depth my relationship with my GF in a previous post. Ill post a link to the previous post for better understanding. So I’ve been slowly working my way through it but I’ve come across another obstacle. I want to help my GF get appointments or do whatever she has to do to help her with her depression the problem is....some giving her help adds on to the depression. She doesn’t like the feeling of me doing things for her because she really wants to try to feel independent as that’s a problem that insists on her depression. But I just know at the moment it’s gonna be really hard for her and take a bit of a while. I want to have faith and believe she can can do it but I REALLY care for her and want to help. What do you think I could do to go about helping her without adding to her depression and stress?

295,1,I just worked most of the night and when i was done the money i had went to paying off some back bills. I get ready to head to bed at 4:30 am and find that my cat pissed on my bed. Not just on the sheet... Ooohhh noo! Through every freaki g layer I had on my bed. Got one of my pillows that are not washable and two yogabo stuffed animals that are not washable! And to top it off i have to go to the laundromat to wash them and i have no freaking money to do so! I seriously can't catch a break.
296,1,"Anyone else find it predictable? Once you understand the world, things get pretty boring afterwards. 

Luckily we have distractions. This reality bores me"
297,1,"I dont see the point of anything. I dont find joy in anything anymore. Everything I use to love is now bland and pointless. music, gaming, food, sleep. It's all pointless. It's pointless to talk to anyone. Anyone I talk to about it makes me feel stupid. Idk how to reach out for help. Idk how to want to. I feel like everything is pointless."
298,1,My friend was gungho to join the armed forces and we were all proud of him but when he was diagnosed psycosis me and a couple friends promised that we would enlist in his place a lot of my family was military grandpa was airforce one of my uncles was navy anothor one was army and one of my great uncles was army i wanted to enlist but a couple months ago i was talking to the recruiter at my school and i found out that due to my asthma there was little to no chance that i could get into any branch of the military i feel like ive failed my friends and family i almost feel like a disgrace I failed
299,1,"So I have no idea exactly how long I’ve had depression but what I do know is it’s the loneliness that kills me. I have friends and family who I know care about me but I still feel lonely and I’m only 18 (almost 19). I’m on antidepressants and I’ve been to therapy, both help me, my therapy finished and there was change, huge change and the antidepressants stopped the suicidal thoughts and attempts but my therapist told me one thing, something that is my worst enemy, the main cure I have which I don’t know how to stop. I’m only my true self when I’m in a relationship, it’s something many don’t understand and it’s a struggle, when I’m in a relationship all my friends see the real me, they see me back to the way I used to be but if that relationship ends I get worse, worse then I was before and the longer I’m alone the worse I get, for the sake of my best friends sanity as well as my fear of death I refuse to kill myself but I can’t help but want to, I can’t help but just want to die. I recently came out of a relationship which is why I’m talking about it because what makes it worse is my ex before him was still in contact with me because he wanted some of his stuff back and I was still in the process of doing that but he ended up taking my boyfriend and now I’m worse then ever, I seriously want to die but I can’t, I have no one to talk to at all and I can’t keep doing it My cure is the worst"
300,1,"I'm just going to get this out because I feel like I need to vent it out. I've been depressed since the age of 16. I was in high school and in a long distance relationship. Most people will tell you that won't work out. At that age it's hard to realize that, but I knew that not every relationship would work out. I was with a girl who had a lot of issues herself, and that is how we bonded. I never really flirted with her as much as shared experiences. I'd be lying though, if I didn't mention I was interested in her. Hard not to when you share personal information with someone that you haven't with anyone else. I don't want to get to much into this because there's a lot more I'd like to address. To sum it up we had a very deep and vulnerable relationship between the both of us. We both had shared a lot and depended on each other. Long story short by the age of 18 she wanted to move out to where i lived and start a life together. Being 18 and not out of high school and a part time job worker, i thought this wasn't a good idea quite yet...But the main reason would be because I had a very strong feeling she would fall for one of my friends over me very quickly. She was an ambitious person, and although I was very smart for my age, I didn't show much ambition or purpose. I was a lost soul. Fast forward about 10 years(we remained close friend) she was coming off a tough divorce and asked if she could come out my way. She lived in Arizona and I live in Michigan. After all i know about her and the relationship she got out of i really wanted to be there for her. I'd be lying if i said that i still didn't have feelings for her too. Well my worst fear came true and she fell for my best friend and they took off to Colorado to live a life. From what i hear that didn't work out(financially) and they're, presumably, back in Michigan. This doesn't bother me now but it has a lot to do with my underlying issues of emotional trust. 

Then there is the life I lived at home. My parent divorced when I was 6 years old. I remember it very vividly but to be honest this didn't really effect me much. I don't think i was able to fully comprehend it at the time, but i still had both my parents and saw them frequently so i was happy. That is until my mother(who was my primary caretaker) felt she needed another father figure in my life. She married a man 10 years younger than her who off the bat said he didn't want to deal with kids. Should have been a red flag for my mom. Lets be honest though. My mom had dated several people, some were great, some not so much. Never the right balance of good character and physical attractiveness. Now my step-dad is a smart person, but also very close-minded. This is a dangerous combination. He was also 10 years younger than my mom. She was 50 and he was 40. He also had a daughter that was 3 years younger than me. To shorten this story both parents we unable to agree on parenting techniques. Now both of us were not perfect children. Lets be honest there are very few children that are. I had caused a lot of issues with my long distance calling to said gf above. My step sister was just completely disrespectful and insulting to both parents and myself. Not to say I was a beacon of perfection. The problem lies with how my mom and step-dad came across punishment. My step-dad would like to punish me more and my mom would like to punish my step-sister more.  My step sister was much more of a problem than i was as far as being disrespectful and obscene. She would constantly curse at my mother. I would constantly call my step-dad ignorant because most conversations with him would come down to insults. This caused a hell of a lot of toxicity and issues within the household.

That was all just between the ages of 16-18. There was more also but this all lead to me moving out asap. my step-dad even made it clear he wanted me out asap. Not a real issue with me because i wanted the same. 

Since then I've been cheated on twice(both with my best friend to boot) and I lost a lot of trust with people in general.

I had a great life overall in my 20s as far as partying and making great friendships. I pretty much made my friends my family. I'd do anything for them. There are a hell of a lot of fucked up stories i can tell you that happened but nothing has messed me up more than the toxicity that was my household and the first two relationships i was in. I had such a huge identity crisis at my formative years. A lot of people have this issue. I took a lot of the positive traits from my friends and tried to instill them into myself to form an identity that could help me prove to myself that I was a good person and deserved good things. That never happened though, because it was all fake, or at least that's how i saw it.

I'm now 30 years old and I've always tried to look back and improve on my problems. I have in my mind the most perfect girlfriend I think anyone could imagine. She's so thoughtful and loving and supportive. Everything i needed when i was younger and more so now. However, i still can't help but feel like I'm not enough. I was never enough for my first two girlfriends, who i gave a lot up for, but ended up with them cheating on me with someone who either has the support of their parents to help them through any strife, or someone who was more physically attractive then me. I completely understand them wanting to leave me for something else, but at least tell me that and break off the relationship before you go and fuck the other guy and i find out from other people. that's just fucked up.

I feel suicidal almost every day, although i would NEVER commit it. I can say this for a fact, because i've witnessed my mother attempted it 2 times. One other time was when she was at work and apparently overdosed on some medication. As far as she thinks i only know of the time she tried at work. The other two times was from carbon monoxide poisoning in her car(back windows were open) and the other was an overdose in the bathroom that didn't work out. She doesn't remember any of these situations. She doesn't even remember when i told her i wanted to move out to my dad's because of the chaotic environment. She then said she wouldn't be able to make it without me and implied suicide. How the fuck as a 16 year old was i suppose to abandon my mother and live with my father at a more stable place.

I'm now 30 years old and have more trust in my gf and her family then my own. I've only shared bits and pieces with my gf's family, because i'm scared they might tell their daughter i'm a lost cause. We've been together for 4 years and it's the strongest relationship I've ever felt. 

I'm not really looking for advice but i will read and consider everything. I always try to keep an open mind about everything because I've always strive to improve myself. I only hope that this may enlighten others and show that no matter how bad things get. Never give up! I'm so lucky to have found someone that supports and believes in me. There is someone out there that can help you. They may not be relationship material, but they could just be a close friend. There are a lot of people out there that suffer from other issues. We all need someone to be able to rely on. Love to all those that need it. Depressed since 16 years of age. Severely depressed since 27. I'm 30 years old and have been trying to make an attempt at improving myself."

Continuing the trend of being met with little to no response on this sub, I'm feeling more and more comfortable unburdening myself by sharing my depressive thoughts and experiences here, thanks to the relative anonymity offered by my favorite social media site, Reddit. 

Depression seems like it's boxing me in more and more with each passing day. Every hobby that used to bring me joy, every TV show or video game that used to satiate my emptiness, any day dreaming that brought goosebumps to my skin and warmth to my heart, now grants me little to no emotion. 

I can still see a light in the distance, albeit dim. I feel as though I'm not completely lost, not just yet. I feel as though my screams are as close as ever to breaching the surface. Close as ever to breaking through and coming into the light, screaming *HELP! HELP! I'm being consumed! Get this parasite away from me!* All the same, the dark cloud grows ever thicker, crushing my voice and filling my lungs. It eats away at me, eating nearer and nearer to my core.

I feel stronger and more determined than ever, yet simultaneously completely hollow and vacant. Perhaps the beast is running out of things to feast on, leaving only my ravaged husk to be tossed to the wayside. 

It's just a ridiculous metaphor, but I'm sure some people can relate. Another plebsy post."
302,1,"A while back I was really struggling with an eating disorder to the point where I would only eat at dinner and a small portion at that. I'm better now because I realized how damaging the behavior was, not because someone told me. So that means that 1 both my friends and family didn't notice (I lost a good 40 lbs so...) or 2 no one cared. And really, I don't know which one upsets me more. I realized something today..."
303,1,"I’ve been in this depressive episode for over 6 months. I’m 25 and unemployed with a bachelors degree. Before this moment, I’ve worked and gone to school since I was able. I’ve been seeing a psych doctor, trying medications, IV Therapy, Fisher Wallace Stimulator. 

I do feel better. I don’t have anxiety anymore. I can’t say I feel hopeless and worthless. I don’t feel like crying all the time. 

The problem is I sleep in every day till 4-6. Really depends on when my mom comes home because I can set an alert when she leaves work. I don’t even get up to eat lunch. 

I removed basically all responsibility’s I have other than take out the trash and occasionally do the groceries. My mom doesn’t charge me anything for rent/utilities/groceries and both my parents occasionally buy me lunch or dinner. My parents are also helping me massively with costs for medication and doctors. My expenses are car insurance/gas and any meals when I eat alone or with friends

I know I’m imposing heavily on my mom and being a leech. I know I need to get a job. My friends and family tell me this basically every day. That this is the next step to getting better. They’re slowly starting to judge me for not having one. Telling me to get my shit together, that I’m feeling better and need to put in more effort. 

But I’m terrified of getting a job. I’m scared of feeling every morning like I have to drag myself out of bed, be miserable on the drive over, and suffer through the 5-8 hour shift doing whatever. 

They’ve suggested getting a night shift job so I can sleep in. A part-time job so it’s not many hours. Working for Amazon, or UPS, or a restaurant. 

But every time I think about applying, I remember how it feels every morning when in wake up under the sheets. How at that point, I want nothing more than to close my eyes for a few more hours and forget everything. Any phone call or text I receive to hang out or help someone with something feels like such a huge inconvenience. 

I never used to be like this. I used to love helping friends. Love going out. I mean, I liked to sleep, but never like this. Sleep has taken over my life. It’s my way of escaping. And now the hard worker I used to be is being called lazy. I feel better, but I’m scared to add responsibilities again."
304,1,"Every time I spend time with any friends, throughout my whole life, I ended up feeling shittier than I did before I hung out with them. I enjoy friends before I get close to them, then when I do, I feel like shit. I don't know if it's depression, because these feelings don't linger for very long, but they start back up again in an instant, and they're terrible. Yet, I hate being alone. I want to find somewhere I belong. Yet, when I have something, I feel like shit. The only person I've ever gone out with was someone I'm embarrassed to have entered a relationship in, and I'm so embarrassed by the person I have been throughout my whole life. No matter how much I talk about this with people, I can never reconcile myself. I'm not asking for a reddit diagnosis, I just want to get this out. I want to know what I should fucking do. I don't know what's wrong with me"

307,1,"i’ve never been clinically diagnosed as depressed, and i’m doubtful of whether i’m truly depressed or just in bouts of prolonged sadness. 

either way, this feeling has completely destroyed the way i live life, and has affected my decisions a long way. the horrible thing is, no one around me seems to realize it. (trigger warning) i spent a few weeks so down i did a number on my left arm using scissors and just played it off as a cat scratching me and everyone looked at me, joked that it looked like i actually self-harmed, and didn’t question it once. after that, confiding in anybody didn’t exactly seem like an option given everyone around me treats depression as a joke. 

the worst part is that i have absolutely NO CLUE why i feel this way. i’m not exactly what you’d call a textbook failure. i have decent grades, just acquired a scholarship and have a good circle of friends. but on the flip side, whenever i achieve something good, i can’t help but feel as if i don’t deserve it. it upsets me almost as much as when i fail. and when i DO fail, it affects my mentality in several ways, i can’t pull myself out of the house no matter how hard i try.

my low self esteem has led me to making decisions to paths that don’t let me fulfill my potential, because god FORBID i try and fail again. whatever decision i make torments me and essentially doesn’t really help me in enjoying life at all. being an introvert probably has to do with this, but i feel lonely all the time, even when i’m with my friend(s), and the fear of missing out is basically with me 24/7, even though i don’t even LIKE social activities all that much. 

i feel insanely guilty for feeling like this when people around me have it worse and have much less to be grateful for, but the intense hatred i have for myself and for life just overpowers everything; it’s frankly exhausting as hell. the rat race and competitiveness hasn’t even begun (i’m in college) and i’m dreading it. everything in my future look like punishments unfolding and i can’t stop it. i just want it to end. i feel sad... but i don’t know why."

Last year i was prescribed Citalopram, but it made me paranoid and ""high"", and triggered my 'dormant for 15 years' bulimia. I suffer from depression/anxiety but also PMDD - so the symptoms are almost unmanageable before I come on my period. 

2 months ago I was prescribed daily 20mg Fluoxetine/Prozac and I felt like a changed woman, I felt so good. I lost my sex drive and orgasm but I don't mind if I'm not crying all the time! Recently however, BAM. All my sads and angrys are back and I am exhausted. I can't get enough sleep, I shouted at my amazing boyfriend and I'm crying a lot.

310,1,"A spot I remember being with her at. I remember how happy I was, I was content with what I had. I had someone who cared about me, that I cared about, I had a reason to take care of myself. That beach. Lying there just smiling and being happy, I miss that so much. I miss being genuinely happy. Sure there's times when I am a bit happy, but there's always that knowledge that it will be over quicker than it started and I'll just be back to being depressed. I want to be happy. I want to be with someone that will tell me everything will be okay. I want someone to just be able to hug when I'm feeling down. I want to have someone who truly cares. I want so have a reason to look after myself. Because I'm not now. I'm basically taking the long route of suicide. Eat as much shit as I can, take shit I know isn't good for me. I want to just die of a heart attack or something and so one would be hurt as much. Because if I kill myself then people will be hurt more. But if its a heart attack then its just something that couldn't be helped. With suicide people will think what if I had done this or what if I hadn't done that, and I don't want that. I don't want to hurt anyone else. I just want to die in peace. Just in my sleep or something, where no one is to blame. And finally I could have peace.

311,1,"Hi, so recently I have been put in a situation where I was forced to question my own mental health. I am a college student so during the school year it was easy to blame my always being tired, lack of motivation and fear of being alone on the schooling and piles of homework. But now it is summer break and I have had a little more down time and a lot less distractions.

On my best days I feel like I am sleepwalking through the day, like watching the world through a lens. On the bad days I am so tired, I am slow to process my surroundings, I feel utterly hopeless, I find it hard to breathe (like there is something pushing on my chest) and I just don't want to keep on living. (I don't want to die, but I also just don't want to live.) 

I want to talk to my friends about it because I do have an amazing friend group. The problem is they all come from hard lives; drinking, abuse and so on. I feel like a total dick trying to explain that I feel like I am slowly losing a battle. I come from a stable home life and have never major financial problems.  I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY. I have a good life. I tried to confess this to my dad and he essentially told me to ""suck it up"" I tried going to a therapist but she was awful and set me back on the progress I had already tried to make. 

So I guess I need to know if this sounds like depression? Is there any way to tell my friends without seeming like an attention hogging dick? 

Thinks have gotten so much worse this past week I really need help please. Please help me."

I've recently traveled abroad, absolutely loved it and wish I could go back but when I was there, I couldn't help feeling this and it was definitely not the only time it happened (it happens a lot when I go to concerts). I think I developed this because my school days best friend didn't ever spend any money on anything because nothing was worth it.

""It's not home, it's your parent's house."" One of my favorite quotes of all time.

They always are like ""ok, we really want to help you and we'll support you through this"" yet they haven't even bothered to look up how they can help. Instead, they just tell me I'm ""being a teenager"" or ""it's just a phase"". Guess I just don't deserve to be listened to. My parents won't help me at all"
316,1,"It's hard to explain, I purposefully go to the most ""progressive"" places there are on the internet to see people complaining about ""liberals"" who are not progressive enough, and while disagreeing with those people, all i can think is ""what if i disagree with them because i'm an awful, unworthy person?"". While I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, i've been improving tons lately, but reading those things on the internet is one of my last depression triggers. I'll give you an exemple: i'll check redfem subreddits, I'll find a lot of the stuff they say criticising liberal femists or claiming men are trash, then i'll think ""i think the lib feminist perspective is more reasonable, so i must be trash"", or ""i am a man, so i must be trash"". Same happens when me, a center left, pro-welfare capitalism liberal browse communist spots. ""What if i disagree with them because I am scum?""

I'm sorry if this is hard to understand, but this is legit one of the last things that make me really, really bad, and every so often i have the drive to search this sort of stuff, be it only for self destructive behavior. It's like i try to find reasons to think i'm an awful person for not being ""progressive enough"", i guess. ""What if the reason I think this way is because I'm an awful person?"" 

Should I just try to stop worrying about whether or not i'm a good person and just continue believing what my thinking leads me to believe and on being happy?

Sorry if this is a stupid post, but i just can't comprehend why this sort of stuff makes me feel so bad and self loathing. Should I stop worrying about being a good person?"
317,1,"I’ve struggled with anxiety since I can remember. Depression hit in my late teens/early 20’s. I’ve been to the doctor before about it and I’ve tried a few different medications throughout the years but I’ve never been completely honest with him or myself and sat down to write it all out. How I feel, how I don’t feel. The physical effects. All of it. The past 6 months I’ve been feeling like I’m treading water. I’ve been able to keep moving and keep my head above but the past 2 weeks I feel like I’m drowning. I can’t stop thinking about how much I want to feel better, how much I fear I never will, and how much that makes me want to end it all. I don’t have health insurance (am in the US) so this has been my main excuse for not seeking more help, but I found the Walmart $4, $10 list and there’s a lot of mental health medications on it.

327,1,"Hello, sorry for any grammar mistakes since I don't speak english quite fluently.

My depression has manifested my mind for about 10 years now. (I'm 23 years old now) I know the reason why I'm depressed, but I don't have any kind of way out or atleast it feels like it.

I got an extremely abusive father, sickness ain't nothing compared to that amount of physical, verbal and mental abuse he has done to me. Basically I got beaten up for absolutely anything I did ""wrong"". For example if I slept, and as soon as I woke up in the morning and the sheets were just a little bit on the floor or not right exactly where they were before heading to bed, I would get beaten up, grounded or humiliated etc. His sister (my aunt) used to say that he shows love in a different way, but what kind of a love that actually is?

I don't have the answers to overcome this hate towards my father. I'm noticing some kind of a anger issues on me also and the worst nightmare is that some day I will become just like this monster which made my life hell. I know these are quite harsh words towards him since his my father and everything but, still.

I feel so weak and vulnerable every time I'm in the same space as him (due to ""family gatherings"" etc. I have to stay in contact with him.) My mind is going on overload all the time, since I feel like **I need to hate and stay loyal towards him** at the same time.

I've been in therapy for past 3-4 years or something like that. I had an problem with alcohol, but I've successfully quitted drinking. (hooray for that!) But it seems like the therapy doesn't work or the cycle of depression wont go away unless I forgive him in my mind, but how the heck I could forgive for all the tears, scars, pain, nightmares and mental issues he has done to me?

This year has been the absolute worst year for me. I've tried to kill myself 2 times this year due to these mental issues my father caused. My father doesn't know, and somehow I feel like he doesn't give a sh\*t if I told him but my mother knows since I tell her everything.

&amp;#x200B;

**So how can I forgive him?**

TLDR: Extremely abusive father causes 10 years of depression and self-hate. Abusive parent."
328,1,"As the title says, I’ve been avoiding therapy for more than three weeks, because each time I’m at therapy, i become a mess as I have to dwell and discuss my issues and trauma, and it takes me 3-7 days to regain my “normal” emotionally suppressed self. 

I’ve been avoiding because I know I have to keep up with work and uni- because if I went, I’d spiral into my deep hole after each session.

Since I don’t have any work to keep myself busy,  I’m left swimming in my own thoughts. I’m sure most of you with depression know how that usually goes.

I started thinking about how my own depression hinders me, and how difficult it is to verbalize how I actually feel. I realized that most people who struggle with depression most likely encounter the same problems I do. But what about the others?

A buddy of mine, who also deals with depression, said that he has a hard time speaking, period. In his head, he feels like his opinions don’t matter. Whenever he has a serious episode, he says he basically throws his hygiene out the window. He sometimes won’t shower for weeks; months even.

Contrary to popular belief, depression is more than just being sad and unmotivated. If a person has a hard time getting out bed, someone else may assume that they’re lazy. In reality, that person’s biggest hurdle of the day is waking up to see sunlight.

What do you wish people knew about depression? What “symptoms” do you face that no one else talks about? What are some symptoms of depression you wish people were more aware of?"

I can't quit naps completely, because sometimes Im just too tired to function.

Ps. Only positive and healthy remedy please and thank you redit! Does anyone else take naps and wake up super depressed?"
333,1,"Hello all, I'm hoping you could help me out with this conversation. 

Backstory: 

I've(25) been dating my boyfriend(27) for about 10 years now, we met in high school. I knew early on he had struggled with depression and anxiety as he communicated this with me very well when we started dating. It was never really an issue in our relationship as I am close to many people who've also struggled with their mental health and understood it would take a little extra support and understanding on my part.

Fast Forward:

In the past year I've noticed his attitude shift more than normal. For example, he has always had really terrible teeth but would make the effort to go to the dentist a few times a year and get whatever work done he could under his insurance. This year, he pretty much refuses to make an appointment with the dentist. I mentioned going to the dermatologist with him (I have to go) and he again, refused. In short, he doesn't seem like his health is a priority. He also just seems disinterested in being around friends, his job, ect. His job is a big stress factor in his life right now to be fair.

As far as our relationship goes, he seems disinterested in me. He'll continue to joke with me and be with me, but he's expressed no interest romantically or intimately. We've gone through periods like this before, but right now I feel pressure like I need to pull us out of it. It just feels like he is not emotionally invested in me right now.

The Main Issue:

Now, I know the issues he has with himself are to blame for almost everything I've said above. When I've casually discussed his mental health with him he flat out refuses treatment and feels it's just something he will have to deal with for the rest of his life. He doesn't want to take any sort of anxiety medication or antidepressants and he doesn't want to seek therapy. I understand that this isn't something I can control. It doesn't help that he has always had a very dark sense of humor and the ""end it"" jokes everyone spouts off, hit very differently when he says them. It worries me sick. He also takes jabs at his physical health saying ""I probably won't make it past 30 anyway"".

Recently I've have a big problem with him not caring about his physical/mental health. We are at a point in our relationship where marriage is being thrown around and eventually, a family. I worry about having a family with someone who won't get the rotted tooth in his head removed, or swears he won't make it past 30. Let alone someone who doesn't seem romantically invested 

Because of his anxiety, there are hobbies I enjoy alone (we do share many together, aside from a few more social ones). I've been meeting new people out and about and it's so hard to not wonder into a ""what if"" situation.

With all this being said, I love him to death. He is my first real relationship and I've never regretted that because I love the man I have. We are perfect for one another and our relationship is (usually) full of laughter, love, and support. I just want him back in the headspace he's had up until recently. It's been difficult handling the extra pessimistic attitude and It's difficult to look to the future when I'm stressed about our day-to-day relationship now. And I feel that this needs to be a serious conversation so that we are on the same page moving forward.

So people of Reddit, please give me some advice as to how I can approach this conversation gingerly. Are there things I should mention or stay away from? Any advice or speculation helps, I really feel like I'm going through a quarter life crisis.

Thanks in advance! Seeking advice for a serious (quarter life crisis) conversation with my boyfriend who struggles with his mental health."
334,1,"Sorry if this is a dumb post. I live in the UK for a bit of reference. When I was 16, I went to a counselor and got told that I have ""mild depression"" after I basically lied through omission about my mental state just so it could stop. I still have pretty severe signs of depression and I want to get help with it.

Now, I'm 19 and I'm basically broken. My friend is urging me to get help. I don't think it'll do any good, but I may as well try I guess. For him, if nothing else.

Where do I begin? I don't manage anything to do with my GP, I'm not allowed to know anything about that so I can't go that way. The surgery we're in is also terrible, doctors leave constantly and some days they just won't be open, or they'll open late/close early.

What am I meant to look for? Therapist? Psychologist? Counselor? Something completely different? And how do I find one?

I'm really at my end here, and the thought of trying to get help terrifies me. But I think I need it. Any advice would be appreciated. What's the process for getting help?"

Last year my aunt called the cops on me while I was at work and I was suspended from work than subsequently fired. I have gone over every detail of every thing about what happened. It wasn't my fault. My aunt called the cops because she has mental issues. I was suffering from anxiety and depression and I was venting to her. To become closer to my family I needed to understand more about my dad, because he died when I was 12. He was abusive towards my mother and no one in my family spoke to me about it. I was suffering to get by in life, to stay disciplined, and to not be distracted by things like my mom's failing health and my uncle's alcoholism and depression.

&amp;#x200B;

I was constantly worried. So I reached out to my aunt and felt like I needed a family member I could vent to. Not a therapist, not a friend, not a friend's family member. I just wanted one person I could talk to. My aunt and I had set up for me to go to therapy. I had gone to a psychiatrist in the past. I didn't take the depression and anxiety pills the psychiatrist prescribed me long, maybe a month, because I felt like covering up my feelings with medicine without addressing any of the underlying issues was a waste of money and time.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I got fired, I had worked at my company for almost 5 years. I worked very hard over my final 2 years, and accomplished a lot. I'm not someone to toot my own horn because admittedly I am not confident enough to do so, but I felt proud that I had done so much. My accomplishments weren't rewarded, and I was struggling financially. I don't live in a great area because I never thought I could afford anything else. Looking back, I think I should have put myself in a better area to live when I had the financial means to do so because the stress of living where I live has affected me negatively in more ways than I can count.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted a promotion so I could move to a single bedroom apartment closer to my family and friends, and so I could afford to get a dog to love on. It sounds stupid, but I felt like that was what I needed. When I vented to my aunt the day she called the cops, I was so frustrated at myself for not trying harder. While dealing with everything I was going through, depression and family issues, I thought just maybe the effort I put into work would be enough. But I have never been good at the corporate ladder climb. My text to her said ""I'm so upset I feel like I could hurt someone right now"". If you know me, as I expect family and friends do, you know I was volunteering with kids at the time, you'd know my father died when I was younger, my grandmother who practically raised me died when I was 17, and that I understood the concept of death. I own no weapons, I have refused to fight back several times while being assaulted...I just don't like violence. My feelings that day cost me my job, and the ability to get another job because all companies check with my former company...they know I was discharged.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago I saw a girl walk by from 25 feet away. I saw her dress twirl as she rounded a corner. For the first time in a while, I can't explain what happened to my heart, but I felt it. Another year went by after that, I thought about her from time to time. But I never thought I should reach out to her because I didn't think I was lovable, or that anyone could love me, and that if I were to get into a relationship I wouldn't be worth the investment for them...and ultimately I would be depressed when they would leave. I was afraid of being hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time I felt like reaching out to my aunt, March of last year, I was also speaking with this same girl I was enamored with. She was an intern, a few years younger than me, at the company I was fired from. I felt like I couldn't say anything to her because of that reason too. It's not like we were born in a different generation or anything, both of us being born early/mid 90s. It was just another excuse, that and my depression, that stopped me from giving it a shot, or talking to her...

&amp;#x200B;

One day an intern I was training came back and said ""some girl is passed out on the ground by the break room. I think they may have called an ambulance for her"". When I asked who it was, it was her. I started to panic, I wanted to do something, anything. I went to the break room and acted like I was getting water and I saw her lying there with people surrounding her. I wanted to rush in and help, or get everyone to back off and let her have some space. She was fine, and I still felt the need to say something. I felt so selfish afterwards because she was fine but I still wanted to be there for her.

&amp;#x200B;

I messaged her on Skype and asked if she was okay. I thought I was being super creepy. I didn't know how else to express my feelings at the time. I was too shy to come up to her and ask, and I didn't want to cause a scene or anything. I felt she would want her privacy. She ended up thinking I was nice for asking, and after that day we would talk daily. One day after my birthday weekend, I felt kind of down and stressed so I took a Monday off from work. She had been wanting to wish me happy birthday, and I couldn't understand why she even cared. I still don't understand why she cared about me.

&amp;#x200B;

The job never mattered to me, she did. I always imagined getting to know her, slowly, at a leisurely pace, becoming her best friend. I wanted to do things with her, listen to her, communicate, sing songs together. I imagined making love to her. So when I was fired, I felt that all the things I wanted couldn't be anymore. I was now financially unstable, severely depressed...a complete mess. Our relationship was just beginning. And to top it off - she was also going through her own life challenges, graduating college and seeing how challenging the world outside of school can be, while also challenging her own faith in religion and trying to maintain her relationship with her parents.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks went by after I was fired. I looked at the way I was texting her recently as I forced myself to go through the last year, recollecting every moment that occurred, like friend's getting married all the way down to random group chat messages with my best friends. The way I was texting her those first few weeks after being fired were without emotion. I don't remember much about that time, because I don't think I was even there. And to some extent, all of last year and the beginning of this year I don't think I was there. During the first two weeks of me being fired this girl and I started to become a lot closer...and I was afraid of that. I knew what I was going through already, and months later I came to find that she was going through a lot too. I tried not to hold her hand as we laid in bed one night...and she felt hurt by this, as did I. This moment was something I imagined in a dream and it was happening. I was so afraid of hurting her that I didn't show her affection, and that lasted all the way through our relationship that ended last December.

&amp;#x200B;

After the hand holding issue, I decided I wasn't going to let anything get in the way of how I feel about her. We kissed the following week, and things were amazing for a short while. I was never truly myself around her. I was never happy even though she made me happy, and I squandered an opportunity to restart my life by being depressed all the time. The way I was let go by the company was somewhat messed up, legally I mean. I got a lawyer and received a severance package that got me through a year's time.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost on a weekly basis last year she would try to do something to get me to get up in the morning and try to move on. She was this strong even while dealing with her own issues. She hid the fact that we were together from her parents while living with them, 50 minutes away from me and from work, under a curfew, and to this day her parents don't know about me. One reason was that I wasn't religious, and the other was that she had issues with her parents and her last boyfriend. She was dealing with a new full time job at the company I was fired from and struggling with working for a big corporation. She has always wanted to help people and make them happy, rather it by being there for them or making yummy food. When I was real depressed in March last year, she made me a pie. No one's ever made me a pie.

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend's ex girlfriend passed away a few years ago. It was an overdose but she left a note on her stating it was because of my best friend. I know he loves her to this day. I'm so afraid now that I will never be able to be who I want to be for the person I love. I worry about my mom and her health a lot too. She is having brain surgery next week and it's very serious...she could die. I have no money, no job, and I am barely hanging on.

&amp;#x200B;

I squandered my opportunity last year to go back to school or do SOMETHING. Everyday I got up, made myself coffee, told myself everything was okay and did nothing to better myself. Everyday the girl I love came to see me like this...and I just wasn't truly happy with myself. I never grieved about my old job, I never tried to fix my relationship with my mom, or my aunt. I didn't try to do anything. And now every day I cry before falling asleep and wake up so saddened by my reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I dream about the girl I love on a weekly basis. Sometimes the dream consists of a challenge I have to solve to get to her, and at times those challenges are impossible to solve and I never get to her. Though we broke up last December, we began talking again in late January. Eventually we began to kiss again, and talk on a daily basis, but I knew it wasn't going to last and it hurt me the whole time. I never wanted to move on from her, I never want to move on from her, but I know she was hurting the whole time too. I don't know how to let go of love, because love is all that matters to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to go to therapy last year, but it was going to be expensive and I couldn't get health insurance. My psychiatrist I saw that prescribed me depression and anxiety pills had written in her notes I was an alcoholic, which is undoubtedly a lie, but carriers would not insure me. That alone was enough to make me give up on trying further. Any obstacle was enough to get me to give up last year. In many ways I had given up on myself. My girlfriend was my crutch and kept me going, like a broken vase held together by glue.

&amp;#x200B;

Only recently have I shattered, and I am shattering while seeing her exit my life. I began to face everything that happened to me head on in May of this year, an entire 13 months after it all occurred. And at the beginning of June, the girl I have been talking about told me we need to stop speaking. At this point, the severance is gone, my savings are all gone, no job has been willing to hire me, including jobs at places my best friends work. I barely eat, and I am a burden on everyone in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

When she told me we should stop speaking, I was having issues breathing. We both have gone through so much together, including things like me absolutely believing she had pancreatic cancer and having a complete mental breakdown about it, only to find she is a hypochondriac. We've shared so much with each other, but I've never really been there all this time - I want so badly to be a healthy version of myself with her. I couldn't handle what she was saying to me...she told me about how she handled losing her ex in the past...and I handled it similarly last month. I told her I couldn't do this right now, I begged her to not do it. I shouldn't have put her through that.

&amp;#x200B;

When I felt my weakest, I told her I was a loser, that I might as well jump off a bridge. She texted my best friend's wife, and not until last week did anyone tell me she had texted her. My best friend's wife, who is my friend, helped her process what she was going through, because this girl I love wanted to call the cops on me. The second time in a year that someone would have called the cops on me, only this time it was warranted. She didn't call the cops on me, and I reached out to her last week to tell her she did the right thing. The right thing being to talk to my friend about it, but if she had called the cops, I would not have blamed her. Life is something you cannot replace, and death is absolute...I've learned this throughout my life. That's why I know I couldn't ever go through with jumping off a bridge, because until the day I am forced to die, I refuse to give in to an absolute certainty, or to make my loved ones cry over my grave.

&amp;#x200B;

Every day I think about my other best friend (not the one with a wife) and his ex that passed away. I love him with all my heart, and I cry about it because he deserves love and thinks it ended with her. I cry because I want the chance to be with the girl I love, without everything weighing me down. I'm afraid she will move on to someone better than me. I look at her belongings that are still in my apartment, and the gifts she's given me. What once gave me strength tears my heart apart, yet I don't think I could live without them.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to go back to college this Fall. I graduated already 5 years ago with a bachelor's degree, but this time around I want to learn about something I think I am passionate in. All the same, I don't know how to go on without her. I have always been so emotional, and so stubborn. I have kept all my feelings inside for a long time. I am just now seeing a therapist at the help of my grandmother, my aunt's mom. I am just now reaching out to my aunt about what she did to me, and she told me I deserved it all, and she never apologized. My aunt said to get another job and move on...but no job will hire me, and I know that, but I haven't stopped trying. I have to face my reality. I have always blamed myself for how I handled getting fired, and not my aunt.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what else to say. I am worried about my mom's health. I am worried that I won't find a job and I won't be able to support myself. I am worried about my mental health. I am worried about college, that I won't be smart enough. I stopped learning from 6th grade to my junior year in high school because I couldn't see the chalkboard and I was depressed, and this has affected my opportunities in life because I don't know a lot about math. Some days I try to get on Khan Academy to teach myself and end up getting too depressed or I procrastinate and never get anything accomplished.

&amp;#x200B;

More than anything, I just miss her, and I feel selfish all over again, just like I did when I reached out to see if she was okay after she passed out that day at my old job. She is alive still, going through her own hardships, and I still just won't let her be, at least in my heart and mind. We are not speaking or seeing each other but I see her everyday in my heart. I'm tired of being sad, but I love her. I mean I really, really really really love her. I love her so much that I feel stupid trying to explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know so many other people have life worse than I do. I also know that it's all relative, but I know I need to be stronger. When I think about getting my degree, and getting a job from that degree, and eventually moving to a place closer to my family, friends, and getting a dog to love on years from now...all of that doesn't motivate me. I think I need a lot of therapy and medication, but I don't think it will come soon enough. Because I think about her so much, and the last thing we talked about was how she couldn't be my crutch any longer. I told her no one was my crutch, and I don't want her to hurt, but she was my crutch. I was helping her go through her issues as well, and I know she didn't want to be alone, but I know you can't be someone's crutch forever. Without her I just don't feel like I can ever be the person I want to be. I want to hug her every day of my life and never let go. I miss everything about her, and I wish I had the clarity I have now last year while with her.

Thank you for any response. A year of my life went by consumed in depression"
336,1,I know I'm meant to die and yet I can't kill myself despite how much I want to. please don't tell me not to. I know it's what I have to do. I've lost everything. I can't do anything right.

337,1,"And so is everyone else and that’s the worst part. I used to believe that we can act and love better but I know such a reality wouldn’t matter because it wouldn’t be human anyways.

“If that car was speeding just a little fast it could Tbone me and kill me.”

Not going deliberately out of your way to make something happen. But hoping for the chance it happens and it out of your control and it’s hopefully quick and painless. Maybe being a little more careless hoping something would happen or spark from your carelessness? Does anyone else think like this?"

But then, night time hits and my head is filled with dangerous thoughts. I thought I was better, I’m laughing more, trying to be more engaging, and I’ve spent most my free time outdoors and yet... all that time means nothing when just a second alone with my mind ruins days of progression and healing. Sometimes I feel myself getting better. Then I’m not."
345,1,"I'm a bit of a social mimic. I just can feel whatever I want really, I understand emotions really well and how people work in general.  


Depression seemed like such a deep and dark problem, I really wanted to understand it. So I learned how to be depressed. I got really depressed. To be fair, I had some shit happen in life that I had genuine reason to be depressed about, so it's not like my brain didn't have fair reason to feel awful.  


Truth is though, I made it worse than it had to be, because those around me were depressed as well and I felt I couldn't break out unless I broke them out of their depression too.  


I just chose today to stop mimicking other people's depressive tendencies.  
I can't fix anyone else. No matter how well I understand them.  
I just want anyone depressed to know, I understand depression, I overcame it.  
I sympathize with all who struggle. I have several friends who struggle daily.  


Me being depressed can't help them though. It won't fix their lives just because I feel what they feel.

I won't ever give up on my friends who suffer from depression. 

I will do my best to be a beacon of hope in the darkness. I just realized today that I've been allowing myself to feel depression to understand it."

349,1,"The TL;DR as best as I can -  This year I lost the only person that has ever stayed in my life for more than a year with huge betrayal involving putting me in $30k in debt up and leaving me with fill rent, and saying she doesn't want anything to do with me anymore because I wanted to vent about another girl who stopped taking to me. 
 The other girl started talking to me but the other day also said that I was making her life harder and didn't want me around anymore because I foolishly told her I love her.  

I'm burned out on trying to be a good person without ever having any benefit.  I've found myself doing things that would have appalled me before.  Things like getting a little bit of enjoyment in smacking my dog hard, sometimes for no reason.   Not having any consideration for others.  Empathy fatigue.  Just I don't like who I'm becoming and the worst part is I no longer care. I think my depression is turning into something more."

Nobody awake, nobody suitable to hear my story so thank you for reading. I have been depressed before, 5 years ago, had a good reset had some good years but YUCK the last year I felt my life was going down. I found myself in the position where I just did not feel like living again. Never been the suicidal type but the fact that the idea seems attractive to me scares the shit out of me. I am the ambitious type, resulting in never being proud of what I achieve. Disappointed in myself when I try to sleep basically every day. University is not working out, job costs so much energy, I am more and more frequently using drugs, fraternity boards are feeling obligatory and not enjoying it. My childhood just fucked me over and I am guessing it fucked me over more than I realize. I just can’t get out on my own and will be calling a psychiatrist in the morning. My previous one died of cancer 5 years ago and I guess I wasn’t done yet. Thanks for listening reddit I hope I can catch some sleep before another shitty day starts at 7:00.

It’s been okay having my dad here until this morning. At breakfast, he brought up how apathetic I was towards life and how he wanted more for me. I come from a religious family as well and he mentioned how great religion was for him and how he wanted it for me, yet didn’t put on the pressure like I hear a lot of religious parents do. To be honest, I don’t know how he could have handled that talk better. 

A little bit later, a recent friend texted me, “I think you always resort to thinking of worst case scenarios. That’s not healthy.”  

Two unrelated responses from people on the same day, telling me things I already know about myself switched me from accepting my spot in life and taking joy when it came my way back to full on depression. My dad went to visit my sister across town and I went on to sleep the entire day away. I had a dream where a “friend” constantly wanted to “play fight”, but was much better at it and kept resorting to choking me out and not letting up. I eventually woke up in a gasp, still feeling the pressure on my windpipe, thinking, “I wonder if I can actually die from the power of suggestion in a dream? That would be the way to go. I’m going back to sleep.” Had my first “getting murdered” dream. Woke up to realized that while terrifying, I wanted to get back to sleep to continue it."

But, I think it’s my time. Good night! 😌 Sad Tale of a broken spirt"
360,1,"I couldn’t sleep last night because this world was on my mind 


What will become of it and where will we be 


I need something to set me free


Perhaps a drug 


Perhaps a hug


Maybe a needle 


Maybe a knife 


Maybe some pills 


Maybe a hill 


I find myself focusing on my hand 


Trying to keep it steady as it shakes 


Another tear rolls down my cheek 


I’m standing in the dark 


A flight of stairs before me


How many stairs are there?


I count thirteen 


Will I throw myself down them


Will I walk away and leave that for another day 


I look at the time 


A bit past twelve 


Cars still ride the road outside 


And streetlights are on 


I step out of my body for a moment 


Say hello to the stars


Say goodbye to the cars that pass by 


I look towards my parents room 


They don’t see me 


Slowly walking towards my doom


They’re fast asleep 


In their own dreams 


Far away from me 


In my mind 


I’m slipping away 


Each and every fucking day 


But that’s okay 


I never wanted to stay 


I go and look in the mirror 


Tryna and give myself hope 


My eyes are red from crying 


There’s bags from not enough sleep 


There’s acne from caffeine that keeps me awake


There’s the grease in my hair 


I haven’t washed for a month


Can’t get myself to do it


It feels like too much 


I look myself in the eye 


Say it’ll be alright 


A tear falls and I wipe it away 


Tell myself I’ll see another day 


Resist the urge to go back to things 


Like cutting my wrists 


And hiding with sleeves 


Walk back to my room 


Sit on the bed 


It’ll be alright 


I get under the covers 


blinking back tears 


no more night light 


no more fears a poem about last night it’s okay if no one reads it I just need to get it off my chest"
361,1,"I've recently started cutting. Not deep enough to make a scar, just enough to bleed and have a scab after. I know cutting . is greatly hated upon. for me, it has helped me stop snapping at my loved ones and I don't feel as depressed. If I am not cutting deep enough to cause serious damage, why is it such a bad thing? Why is self harm bad?"
362,1,"Also, another big reason for my sadness is that I feel like I can/will never have a significant other. I'm super selective and I hate myself for it, espically since I'm only in high school, I always get hooked on one person for months and even years at a time who I would like to date, share my feelings with, and just spend time with, but I typically never muster the courage to do as much as say hi. That changed with this one girl, I really felt like she was perfect, I could talk to her about anything, and we would have late night conversations that would go on into the early morning hours, on top of this she was so unbelievably pretty. The one thing that irked me though is that she had commitment issues, which she even admitted, despite this I was head over heels for her. One day I mustered all the courage I had and asked her out and she said yes but then canceled. Meanwhile through all this I was talking to my only closest friend, who was helping me with everything. We had hung out as a group a couple times and he really was trying to help us get toghter. I guess my friend had convinced her to be honest and say she didn't want to date, and honestly as much as it hurt I appreciated because I knew to not try anymore or get my hopes up. But then I noticed that they would hang out so much, just the 2 of them, she would talk to him even more than whenever did with me. And one day my friend said he couldn't keep this from me anymore because he said I was still his closest friend and he didn't want to keep secrets and told me that they had hooked up and had sex recently, I can't tell you how much it hurt, it may of been because she was the closest I ever got to finding a significant other, but I think it was the fact that it was my closest friend who had done it, he was the only person I have ever talked about my deepest problems, my deepest insecurities to and now as much as I want to forgive and forget, I can't I just can't. He was basically my therapist he would always help me when I felt like shit. I feel like any of this wouldn't of happened if I had never introduced her to him and that really bothered me so much. I feel like I lost the only person i could ever talk to and who could make me feel better, on top of the girl who I still considered a good friend and I would still talk to before he told me about hooking up.

There is so much more i want to say but I just don't know how to put it and it's getting hard to type through these tears, hopefully the pain goes away sometime soon I can't fucking do this any longer I want it to end Hurt pt2"
363,1,"I was just thinking about how stress was really the only thing keeping me going during the school year and now that it’s over all I’m left with is the damage. The anxiety, the self hatred, not being good enough. I’m such a loser and a waste of life. As soon as I can I’m getting as drunk as possible so I can just die. The first month of my summer is over and I spent almost all of it in bed"
364,1,"1. I always feel empty, Idk why
2. I have to use Ritalin (not prescribed because my college tutor is a jackass and wont fill out my referral forms and my parents dont believe in it) to keep focused and maintain a social life
3. I still think back to my girlfriend I had when I was 15 (im 17) and I haven't had a single girlfriend since. Shes the only one I've felt like shes a soulmate to me. I tried to contact her today but she doesn't really seem interested judging by her responses on text.
4. I dont know how to love
5. I dont know how to speak to girls anymore (i used to be able to)
6. I am all over the place.
7. I went to school with people who I considered friends for 6 years. Since I left not a single one has reached out to me. I only have 2 proper friends. I've reached out to them but no one seems to want to bother with me. This makes me feel super empty and alone.
8. I've let myself become a mess
9. I'm in a dark place all the time but I hide it with Work, Cigarettes and Ritalin (not purposefully on the ritalin but it does help)
10. All I do is work

&amp;#x200B;

oh and for the record cigarettes, ritalin and work have not caused depression

There u go reddit :) Thats how I am today. i could probably go on more but theres a small summary.

hopefully one day my life might get a bit better.

felt like i needed to get that out. I tend to fuck up trying to get these things out and delete it all etc but today I actually posted it (probably because I just summarised it) Greetings Reddit"
365,1,What on Earth can a person do to calm this down I have tried relaation exercises but within minutes I am back to feeling so anxious. Restlessness and feelings of unease/anxiety
366,1,"Most people look at my life and think I have everything going for me. I'm a 24 year old girl. I live in a big city. I have really great friends. I make well above six figures and am completely financially independent with no debt. 

But people don't realize that my total abuse and neglect my entire child hood and adolescence have left me a shell of a person. There are basic things I cannot get myself to do. For example, I am a total slob these days because I am too fucking depressed to clean. I have always been an ""athletic"" person but due to my depression I have developed a severe binge-purge eating disorder and am 15 pounds overweight. I know losing 15 pounds would make a WORLD of a difference in my life but I just... can't do it. I'm ashamed of myself.

I feel like I'm watching my ""prime years"" pass me by. I think about suicide almost every day now. I feel like my life is in shambles."
367,1,"*SELF HARM TRIGGER WARNING*
My depression has hit an all time low since I've been home for the summer and away from my college friends and my therapist, who graduated. I've been having some really bad thoughts about dying and cutting/self harm in some fashion. I'm too scared to even ask my Mom to take me to see a doctor to see if maybe some medication might help because she'll either yell at me or just totally ignore me. I also have a family history of mental illness and addiction so taking any medication has always made me anxious. I'm pretty sure the only 2 things holding my life together at this point is my boyfriend and this subreddit.
 I don't think I want to commit suicide because I want to die specifically, but I do want the physical pain and emotional/verbal turmoil to end. I just get so frustrated at myself for even considering it because that means that I'm giving up on my ambitions, and that makes me want to self harm to get some control back in my life. I haven't even started the habit of cutting or anything else and yet I somehow crave it. I've tried everything I can think of to make the urge go away. I've tried prayer, listening to music, painting, drawing, writing, social media, crocheting, reading, talking it over with someone, etc but none of it has really worked to quell the desire to hurt myself. The only thing that seems to keep me at bay is that fact that I don't like pain in general but I'm worried that soon I'll get over that and I won't be able to control myself anymore.
On a side note: I have a really bad recent back injury that triggered a lot of my feelings right now, and my family act really hatefully to me whenever I mention that I can't do something ""normal"" or healthy people can do. I'm just sick and tired of being told from every corner of my life, ""you should get that weight loss surgery so boys will like you"" (they don't know I have a boyfriend already) ""you don't have depression, just stop making yourself sad"" ""why don't you just give up and file for disability since you're too lazy to even try to get a job"" (my family thinks I don't have a job because I don't try. The reality is that no one will hire me around here and I don't even have a feasible way to go anywhere. No car, no money, and no Uber/Lyft in the area). This post was meant to be a question for advice but it quickly devolved into a rant session, sorry about that. But for real, what should I do? Should I ask for help? And where? I really, really don't want to wait and get locked up in some sort of psych ward and I have an extreme dislike of hospitals unless it's necessary. I think I may be suicidal but I'm too scared to commit. Can I get some advice?"
368,1,"I think I might have some sort of depression. Possibly bipolar. Nothing makes me happy anymore, not even playing video games or seeing friends. One minute I’ll be happily playing with my puppy and the next I’ll be feeling like I just want to die. My friends have told me to get help, because they notice when I’m not doing great. The problem is I’m just terrified to tell my parents to take me to a doctor. I don’t know how they’ll react, and I’m scared they might not believe me. It sounds silly in my head, but when I am about to confront them, I think “what am I doing? I can’t do this” I’ve felt like I’ve had depression for about 3 months (I’m 13). When I feel depressed, I feel like that picture of a flattened giant salamander. Atm I have one amazing friend who helps me through the tough times during the summer. I appreciate any advice or help I can get. Hi I could use some help :/"

371,1,"I'm finally saying fuck it and talking about my feelings. Maybe it will stop this pain in my chest, or maybe ease it. I feel like I have no place to always feel down, I have a relatively good family, a hosue to live under, food, water, I go to a good high school. But it's getting to a breaking point, espically after a recent incident which (I will detail in another post). I keep my problems housed up in me, my shitty feelings too. It's hard for me to talk to people, very hard, even people who I'm close with. Even my parents. I can't imagine talking to them about any of this. Starting off with school and friends, school is so stressful and I'm a mediocore student, at best. And college apps are right around the corner and it stresses me out even more because I would like to get into a decent college but there is no reason to accept me, nothing distinguishes me. I don't want to let my parents down and I don't want to set my self up for a worse future. And I feel like I have friends, it's just that it's really an only at school kind of thing, noone really makes plans with me outside school, but I still feel like they are good friends and good people. I have very few close friends, if any after recently. And noone to talk to. Another reason I think I always feel down is that I've never had/don't have a significant other, by this time almost everyone I know has had a significant other and they seem so happy. I get really attached to one person which I hate about myself since it is just high school, I've liked people for months, even years on end. But most the time I can barley muster the courage to talk to them. I think I look like shit, and my nervousness makes it hard to talk to people. After this recent incident I feel like I'm over the edge, I've lost interest in everything I've liked, video games, YouTube, going outside, excersize, talking to friends. I just so badly want to take my revolver put it against the base of my skull and pull the trigger, but I can't, I can't imagine putting my family though that unbearable pain. I also noticed I've been involuntary dropping weight, I've lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks, I just don't feel hungry for days on end and don't eat. I'm always exhausted but I can never sleep. I want to turn to bad drugs so badly I'm so desperate to feel better but I won't let myself. Another thing i with talking to my doctor is that I don't like the idea that it's just antidepressants making me happy, I want to actually feel and be happy because something not bad happened in my life. It really feels like my world that was already been coming crashing down on me is even worse. I just want to feel happy again, or at least not feel so sad it's all I want it seems like such a small thing, but I learnt the importantance  and significance of it.

If you read all this, thank you, I really don't know what else to say, but truly, thank you.

379,1,"A maelstrom of water crashes down

Pure power and force unstoppable

Trapped, at the bottom

A drowned soul with no escape


-

An impenetrable barrier 

No sound escapes this place

Screams of pain echo into the abyss

They hear. But they do not listen.

-

A beast tears away at flesh within

For these scars do not see the light of day

Hidden away, beneath the shell

A facade of a person

Human Being?

Just human now, the Being is gone

Being is all that was him, a kind personality

Laughter, happy emotions, long gone 

The husk of a human

A welcoming embrace

380,1," 

I feel like giving up.

I am alone and no one gives a fuck about. I mean, I care enough about myself but if I died, nothing would change. I'm in my mid twenties and unemployed. I'm not upset about being unemployed because I chose to be. I'm not broke or hungry, I just didn't want to be stuck in the previous job. I live alone (with housemates). I'm in somewhat of a relationship.

I feel defeated. I feel like my life is waste. So, cyclical and mundane. I'm just the result of a random egg and sperm cell, who has to bear the burden of carrying on my existence... Just living to pay bills and stay alive.

I'm in my room thinking about offing myself -hanging or slashing.

I think about how inconvenient it would be though for who finds me (probably through the smell of my decomposing body) and who has to do the cleanup and rummage through my things.

Sigh.

I think my parents will be fine. My brother would be fine. My youngest brother is young enough to not understand. He'll just know I'm not around so it wouldn't be a loss. My boyfriend wouldn't care. He'll have enough things to occupy him either way. I'll just become an after thought.

I don't always feel this way. I usually have enough things to distract me. Then, I remember that I'm just here. I give up"
381,1,"I will do it... Someday. I'm just wondering if it's a good idea to let people know why I did it, because some of them might feel guilty and I really don't wanna anybody to feel that way. Should I write a goodbye/explanation letter before committing suicide?"

I don’t know what I’m really looking to accomplish by sharing this. Maybe I just really needed to vent, I don’t know. Anyway I hope you all have a great night. Thought it’d get better"
383,1,"If I can help even one person with my post, or just find someone who can relate, I'll feel accomplished for the evening.

Anyone who's actually overcome their battle (well.. do you ever really?) is probably laughing at my naivety and recalling a time when they may have felt the same way. 

I'm an early 20s male for context. Yet I eel like a child still. Afraid I always will...

I've had dark moments. The darkest was certainly collapsing on the sidewalk of a road that crossed over a small stream, feeling embarassed and invisible as cars drove by in the night. I was leaning against a short wall of concrete made cold by the wintery night, feeling the frostbite consume my ungloved hands, as I called my friends crying that I felt like jumping over or just staying there and waiting for hypothermia to claim me. 

A few weeks later, they briefly stopped communicating with me citing the overwhelming pressure of being my only outlet. Was it the best way? I don't think. It will forever hurt not having friends for a month. But it's been three months since, and I just hung out with them yesterday. Had a lot of fun for half the day. Was feeling normal. Was feeling that *they* thought I was normal. Was feeling like one of the guys. I love my friends and always will. Then one of them made a comment about a hang out they had while not speaking with me. Instant mood shifter (I thought I had that shit normalized). 

I shut down for the rest of the night. Became a recluse. I guess I was waiting for someone to just hug me and tell me it was gonna be okay. I always am waiting for that. I get the feeling I'll be waiting 10 lifetimes.

Ended up crying in front of one friend at the end of the night. Some jazz about nobody loving me, about how I'll never be loved by anybody, and how I'm pathetic. Looking back on it, hey, I feel pathetic! Was clearly afraid that this would show them that I actually hadn't made any progress and that I couldn't be trusted to not have a breakdown and make them feel uncomfortable...feel the pressure to turn my day around like always.

My friend told me there was nothing to fix. Not to dwell on this. And next time is a clean slate. Then he gave me a hug (with a small prompt; a few minutes after I suggested a slew of things that would make me feel better). He gently rubbed my shoulder. I don't know why, but that small detail is engrained in my head, and has helped calm me down all of today. I felt so connected to him right then. And most importantly, I felt loved without the words having to be said. Is that just my own wild interpretation? Does it matter? I felt it. I felt like someone who mattered.

Yeah, I had a setback. But it hasn't ruined everything. And I'm still going. 

I'll have more setbacks. But I'll keep going. And so will you, wherever you are. I'll send you a virtual hug if you need it. Realizing this is a much longer journey than I was hoping it'd be"
384,1,Recently I've been having more breakdowns. Usually I don't let people see that side of me but I was at work when it happened recently and everyone saw. I talked to my friends and my brother but I couldn't stop it. After I just felt like I was a burden. I'm so tired of being like this. Tired of being aware that all of this is  not real but not being able to stop the thoughts. Even right now I'm so fucking numb and just want to talk but all I can think is how no one what's to to hear about it. I'm not special in any way so why should they care. Tired of wanting to die. At this point I think I'm just gonna do it. There isn't anything that takes my mind off of it. All I do is accept help from those in my life. I've been trying I truly have but what's the point. At this point I know my story ends with me deciding to take my life. I'm scared. My bestfriend has been helping me and she's so understanding and tells me these thoughts are just in my head and yet I feel like she doesn't actually care at the same time I know she does. If I died maybe it would be better for everyone. Honestly why even bother anymore. Why bother anymore
385,1,"So I’ve been going through a difficult time recently, I was sexually assaulted in December last year and didn’t get support at the time. My work was also going through a restructure at the time and I felt my job wasn’t secure, I stopped sleeping and eventually after a couple of months became depressed.

I’ve started seeing a counsellor to try and improve things for me. Yesterday was the 4th session. I’d had a better day, been out and had coffee with a good friend I hadn’t seen for a long time and had quite a nice day. I told her this and she said that you can distract yourself but you’re not dealing with your real issues. Then she wanted to talk about a dream I had had. She said that I was all the people and objects in the dream and her interpretation of the dream was that I was running away from my issues and not facing them.

I left feeling much worse than when I arrived and I can’t see how this is helping me at all. Today I’ve been really confused and not sure what else I’m mean to be doing. 

I want to stop seeing her which I’m sure she’ll interpret as me running away when things became too hard... 

What do you guys think? So annoyed at my counsellor"
386,1,"Does this happen to anyone else? Every time I tell my partner how I feel, they just say something along the lines of ""I'm depressed, too, but I got through it"" or they'll tell me they're feeling depressed in return. And I know they don't struggle with mental illness, as they've already told me about it. And I know they say it to help and all, but it kind of makes me angry. Like, why are you trying to one-up me? Can't you just listen? Last time they told me to just pick up a self-help book. I constantly feel like I'm being invalidated and no one truly understands me. Everytime I tell my partner I feel depressed/suicidal, they sound like they're patronizing me."

I haven’t started therapy yet (I should soon), but I’m kind of scared that I won’t have to motivation to work at the thoughts/self-criticism that are making it worse. Would medication help? I’ve always been wary about jumping into medication, but I’m so tired of feeling this lack of motivation, self confidence, etc. Should I see a doctor too? Or should I see how therapy goes for a while? Finally seeking help"
389,1,"Two weeks ago my psychiatrist gave me a scrip for an MOAI, after years of bad reactions on SSRIs, then went on vacation with a phone appointment set up (for today). When I went to fill the scrip the drug info sheet the Rx provided had quite a few points of concern that the psychiatrist had neglected to mention (diatary restrictions, problems with known family medical history etc). I didn't get it filled and made some notes to bring up when we were going to talk on the phone so we could address these concerns.

The psychiatrist called today, way outside the time window she had given me so it was a rather groggy answer as the call had just woken me. She asked how things were going on the new med. I told her I didn't fill it. I talked with the pharmacist for nearly 45 min about things she haden't mentioned and I wanted to talk- she inturupted me going into a rant about how they had no right to talk to me about the medication and how she was going to call them and chew them out. I interjected that **I** decided not to take it until we had the oppertunity to talk and go over a couple points to which she hung up on me rather forcefully they way only old cord phones, like the one in her office, could achieve.

Five min later there is a blip that I have a voice mail (direct to vm so the phone wouldn't ring). It's her telling me that not taking this medication is a huge mistake as *I* need to be taking something even though I always react badly to medications. Twenty min after that another direct to vm of the pharmacy insistant I call in and that they will no longer discuss my medication with me.  Wtf?

I've been having problems with my psychiatrist not listening to me but this encounter just really frosted the cake. It's time for a change. When your professional decides not to be professional."

I have cried for 6 hours straight today, I cannot get it together. I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to about any of this, my mom and husband worry about me too much if I bring it up. My friends don’t understand. 

I wish I would die; terrible car accident, hit by a bus when crossing the street, victim of a shooting, etc. The thought of doing it myself and hurting the few people who love me breaks my heart. I don’t want to hurt them, just myself. I just want to disappear. I’m so sick of being sad. So depressed"
392,1,"I grew up in a poor household. Both my parents were unemployed for most of my life. My father was an addict (now recovered) that was physically abusive. My mother is a depressed narcissist who also was physically abusive. Needless to say my childhood was not a very good one. I’ve always felt that I was exposed to the ugliness of life too early in life. This was the foundation on which I developed my pessimistic life view. 
I can be a very bitter person at times. I have a very hard time just enjoying life, as I see myself as a tragedy of a figure. 

I sometimes attempt to break out of this gloominess and create a better, new life for myself (I’m 21). But any attempts to move forward I crash and burn. At this point pessimism and depression is my reality and happiness is just some sort of fantasy. It does not help that I meet people who have everything I wish for and are still unhappy. Depression has become my life"

Am I being too picky, just for that? I’m really struggling with this, and I’m struggling to be motivated enough to have some proper hobbies. I’m eating well, so that’s not much of an issue. Just not doin anything with my life.  Any advice?  I live in southeast rural Kansas, so.. Not many options. I could use some advice."

Failed an important test, feel like shit"
398,1,"these days, it seems like every waking moment is spent resisting the urge to kill myself. the only things that have gotten me this far in life are my friends and my family. i’m alive simply because *other people* want me to be, not because *i* want to be. i feel like the only way i can take control of my own life is through the damage i can do to it.

the support isnt helping anymore. “i’d be upset if you killed yourself” doesnt make me feel any better. i just want control over my own fucking life; control over my emotions that have become so fickle i cannot trust any decision made on my own. it seems like the only way i can do this is by destroying everything. if anyone has some crazy advice i guess that would be appreciated but i don’t even know. thanks for reading living for others"

This is good as it gets and it’s not going to change. God, I wish that wasn’t true. But years of being this way have made me really believe it. Does it get better?"

402,1,"I still feel so guilty for taking it even though it was 10 months ago. There was just a liiiiittle chance to get pregnant but my boyfriend claimed it's better to take it. (my period just ended 2 days before our little emergency happened) Since a probably 14 year old my biggest wish was to have a baby. Neither my parents nor my siblings showed me some love (and I never felt close to them too). I always wanted to be close to a family member/relative so I thought having a baby would fix it. I know that this whole thought/idea is completely wrong. 

Well back to the main issue, I still think about what happened. I can't stop overthinking and those 'what if' thoughts are killing me. ""what if I was pregnant?"" ""What if I've killed my onw baby"" ""imagine not taking the pill and getting pregnant, you'd be able to hold your baby right now'. Sometimes I see parents with their babies and start to cry or I start praying that my baby's alright
I think this made my depression worse even though I know it was the right decision because I'm still too young and mental unstable to care about a little baby. Any tips on how to move on? I feel so bad for taking emergency contraceptive pill"

406,1,"I can be cold. Distant and withdrawn. I go through patches where I warm and hospitable but a lot of the times I'm cold and distant with people. I find it so difficult to strike up a meaningful relationship with someone. 

So I usually keep folks at arm's length, and it makes me feel like a bitch, because I'm entirely cold towards them. And if they persist and don't get subtle signs, I'll just outright snap at them. I'm not good with people. I'm a total disaster with men and women that tolerate me usually have patience.

I was dragged to my nephew's end of the year school celebration thing earlier and I wanted to shoot myself. Good God, I've always had a pregnancy sexual kink but I think I'm gonna make my womb hostike because the notion of attending shit like that for 18 years is just nauseating.

I will twirl around my bedroom with a butcher knife, a beautiful dervish, tearing everything apart as Beethoven's 9th symphony funnels energy throughout my being. The power and energy that come with Beethoven is unrivaled, followed cleanly by the ecstasy of pure silence as he slowly fades out of myself. I live for the good old ultra-violence.

They want to get there for the start and end, but when it get to the rest of the 98 percent, not a sound to be found. If you're not a child or SO they just see you off with out a check up. It honestly pisses me off about this. I get told to help them help me, but when I explain to them what I'm feel I get the classic ""I don't understand, but I'll help you through this. Just try see things in different light, or maybe even e can just change the subject. I am asked by these same people who know that I have a inferiority complex about my looks and lack of relationships about the thing I'm insecure about, relationships. I never had one, but I am told I give good advice. I always pick up the phone even if I can't understand. I wish they could do the same for me, only with my mental health. Telling someone about your depression or anxiety is just basically nagging to yourself with them in ear shot. It gets annoying to hear someone nagging each and every day."

Even if he doesn't, I'm confident that our friendship wouldn't suffer if I were to pursue something. My main issue stems from the nature of my feelings. Whenever I spend time with him, I feel a lot lighter, happier, more alert, etc . I don't know if I genuinely have feelings for him, or if I'm craving relief from my depression. I don't want to start something, only to find out post-honeymoon phase that I didn't actually feel anything for him.

413,1,"I've been debating whether or not to post this but decided why not. Might as well get it off my chest.

About six years ago, i made a friend in school and we immediately hit it off. We were best friends for two years until my grandma decided to uproot my whole life and move us out of town 7 hours away because she thought the city was to busy. Those two years i had that friend (I'll call him J) were the single best years of my life with no contest. He had this aura around him that made it so you couldn't help but feel happy and uplifted by just being near him. He never knew about my condition but was still as nice to me as anyone else. (Sorry I'm starting to ramble. Basically, he made me happy for the last time i can remember). Fast forward four years and i had finally had enough of my grandmas shit and left. At her house, i just felt like she only kept me around cause she had too. I came to live with my dad instead and life was so much better but that's not the point. I've been here for six, no seven months now and just been overall better. No one in my life knows my condition but it's been getting better. My only issue is that i am not even 15 minutes away from my old friend but can't say hello. I freeze up or chicken out any time i go near his home. When i left it was sudden and I never got the chance to say goodbye or even tell him.

Two nights ago though, i had a dream and though i don't remember much from it, i do remember him being in it and us having the best time ever. I woke up from it and realized just how much i miss having him in my life. I layed there in bed for a good solid hour before i even considered moving and getting up. It was Canada day and i had to go downtown later to watch the fireworks with my family and for some reason, i only really focused on the crowd of people hoping to possibly see J among the hundreds of people there. I knew I wouldn't and in the end I didn't but I couldn't help but hope. I came home and just layed in my bed for half the night. 

As I'm writing this I'm realizing just how stupid it all sounds. Seven more days and it will be a full four years since i saw or spoke to him last. Sorry for wasting your time. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading to the two of you who did. Had a dream and woke up feeling horrible."
414,1,"It's so bad and there is so much stress trapped in my head but I don't know how to get rid of it.

&amp;#x200B;

It started a week ago. I started school again. The first day went pretty good. But the next morning, I wake up, with a total mental block and the inability to leave the front door. I did everything else. I got out of bed. Managed to get myself ready...But when I went to open the door, my hand just froze before the handle. I ended up not going, and the guilt ate me up, saying that i'm lazy and just don't want to do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

It all comes down to social anxiety...Before going back to school I was and still am an introverted person. I can only manage going out once a week otherwise I will drive myself crazy. I am constantly frightened people are looking at me, and think negatively.

&amp;#x200B;

If something bad or shitty happens, I constantly analyse it for weeks and weeks and weeks. What could I have done better...How much better it would've panned out if i'd had done it this way...e.t.c.

&amp;#x200B;

And today someone attacked me and called me worthless on facebook. Which hasn't helped anything.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, here I am, up at 2AM, unable to do sleep or do anything about the constant battle with my own mind. I could go for a walk, and it would feel ok because there is no one around, but then there is the anxiety of it being dark and also worrying the hell out of my parents, which I don't at all want to do. I feel so frustrated and wish I could smack something really hard, but I can't because i'd make a hell of a noise.

&amp;#x200B;

So I suppose I will just have to deal with this constant 'you're worthless, you're an asshole, you're condescending for not wanting to be near people'. It's back again and I am powerless"
415,1,"I was severely depressed for a few years, and after getting help and being medicated for a while, I'm  ""better"". The thing is, I miss being depressed. Is that fucked up? It feels like a big part of me is missing, as if I don't feel complete without being unbearably sad. I spent so much time growing up, finishing high school, most of college being depressed so I don't really remember what it's like not being depressed. 

I can't really describe in the right words *why* I miss it. It's almost like a mental Stockholm Syndrome I guess. Is it wrong to miss being depressed?"
416,1,"Long story short, I kind of had to raise myself and I didn’t do a good job—ended up very narcissistic and selfish and had very low empathy or consideration for others. Happened all while depression was getting worse and worse (ages 10-17). 

I kept losing friends, which was done more purposely by myself as I got older because I didn’t believe anyone even genuinely liked me; that they were going to leave me when they got too tired of me like many other people had done before. I was very content with being a loner and in some sense preferred it that way, even though deep down all I craved was some actual intimacy. 

I would always think of myself as some pitiful victim. I could never learn why so many people didn’t like me. Being how arrogant I was, you can imagine why I never self-reflected. Yes, my life in general has never been very great at all, and I’ve been quite unlucky with friendships and relationships, but it’s no excuse for being so intense with the way I behaved and thought. 

I’m 18 now, trying to get out of this bottomless pit known as “major depressive disorder” with not much luck. Only within the past month or so have I come to terms with just how shitty of a person I’ve been for a very large portion of my life. 

The biggest issue for me now is that I desperately want to change, but all these terrible behaviors are habit, and they’re what I instinctively turn to in any problematic situation. Hell, I stress my boyfriend out to death with the borderline-abusive ways I act towards him. I want to stop. I realize what I’ve been doing and I feel so fucking bad for it all. I’ve been trying my best this past month to become a more reasonable and better person. 

If any of you have tips on changing for the better, I’d love to hear them. I’m very, very done treating people like this. And I’m ashamed it took me so long to get the balls to take a real hard look at myself. I’ve been a piece of shit for years and only recently came to the realization"
417,1,"So from the outside I look healthy you wouldn't think I had health problems. List below;
- Eye sight gradually getting worst each year and more floaters appearing in both eye. 
- tintinus and hearing gradually getting worst, the only plus side it distracts me from depressing thoughts when trying to get to sleep.
- sinustits which is annoying because it's like having hayfever all year round.
- lipoma which is not an health issue I know but I have 6 or 7 and few are quite noticeable. 

On top of this my mum has cancer which is currently having treatment which is taking a toll on me and causing me to depress. 

Friends have settled and live quite far away so in feel lonely sometimes. I do have my family though which is probably keeping not that depress.

Then today happened...

&amp;#x200B;

First I come home and I'm told that the mole on my back was turning into melanoma and that I have to go back to have a lot cut out to make sure the root wasn't active and spread.... literally 10 minutes later the girl I'm talking too messages to say that she took a pregnancy test and found she is pregnant by her ex.

Maybe I've grown almost comfortable in misery. I don't have hope for the future and I feel like I have no life left in me. I don't know how to change that - I don't know how. I don't know if I have the strength to get better. I don't know if I want to.

I used to be so happy and i looked forward to hanging out with friends and going out but for the past six months nothing makes me happy anymore. Sometimes i spend days laying in bed without showering or brushing my teeth or anything. All i feel is an uncomfortable kind of void inside me and i wish i could make it end. My parents and my therapist tell me to keep pushing and that it will get better but i just feel so stuck. I cant turn to anyone because i hate exposing myself and being so vulnerable in front of others. Everyday i cry for hours and it does nothing. I’ve isolated myself from everyone i know. I don’t know what to do anymore and i don’t know how to express the way i feel in words. I wish i could just end my pointless life but i’m too scared of dying. i feel empty

There must be subconscious feelings there, treatment from the past that I can't let go off. And since it's ongoing in a different way I won't  deny my feelings. I'm damaged already and I decided my way out is not with them. Just waiting to leave them behind. Passive hate"

429,1,"Usually it's the other way round.

I had been dealing with these issues for some time, and managed to get better last year, and apart from some anxiety attacks I was really doing well. 


Until now. Due to my insecurities and fears I always try to give 105% of myself. I was involved in some volunteer work with the organization I found really cool, their people amazing and smart, and it really helped to stabilize my mental health.


I was happy, and when they offered me an official job position, it really felt great and accomplished. But two months later I feel overworked and not being able to get all the tasks within the deadlines. 

The job is ok, people are still ok, but I'm just tired. It's still an 8-hour job, with rules and guidelines, the pay is not great, and my personal life suffers. I'm back to existential issues and questions like - what's the point in life? should I just give up everything and catch fish on some warm island with locals? If this doesn't make me happy, is there anything that does? 

So to sum up, while I was volunteering everything was great, and laid back, but being hired and paid for my work made me become depressive again. Who knew getting a job you wished for could trigger your depression"
430,1,I myself have Social Anxiety and a bad stutter so im basically never talking outside of my house. Also when i go outside it feels like everyone is looking at me but in a bad way like they want me to die because im so ugly.

I cant be the only one doing this How can anyone not have social anxiety
431,1,"Then things became worst. And they became even worst. I had two friends now im down to zero. It doesnt matter, i hated my friends anyway. Does everyone that have friends hate them? Is that just part of friendship? i'll never be like the happy people. I used to feel bad for people when i read their posts."
432,1,"Tl;dr- I pushed away my friend in a depressive episode, and she has left me, most likely for good.

Last night I was talking to her, and my anxiety promted me to ask her if she really wanted to be my friend. She was honest. She said that she couldn't support me and lift me up the way she could before. And that was fair. But then she told me how proud she was of me with how hard I was working to get better.

... then I got incredibly self-destructive. I began telling her I haven't gotten better. A med change is all that has been done for me. I don't know why, but I'm resistant to getting better. To prove this point to her, I told her I was discharged from an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) because my therapist said I wasn't listening or taking her advice. She told me she was incredibly dissapointed and that I broke her trust, since she was only staying my friend because I had promised her I worked on getting better. 

This is when most people try to make things better. But I... kept pushing her away. I told her that I would never change, and that I would just keep dragging her down. And that if she blocks me, she better do a good job, since I'm bound to come back.

Here I am now. Three weeks without suicidal ideations, and they're back to being regular. I could've said nothing, and she would've stayed. Not only did I speak out, I made things so bad, that she made it clear she never intends on talking to me ever again. Shes blocked me everwhere, just like I told her to. 

I don't know why I do this. Despite what I told her, I *was* getting better. But I went out and destroyed the most important reationship in my life, and I will probably be miserable every single day until I move on from her. It feels like a fucking breakup, except platonic. 

I genuinely don't know what I need to get better. I don't know how or if I'll ever get better. I don't see an end in sight. Maybe I'm correct, I'll never change. I'll hit rock bottom, and then just keep crashing down below it. I've already been on psychiatric hold once, and hospitalized twice. Getting better doesn't seem possible to me anymore...

I'm sorry for the rant. I just had to share with... someone, I guess. My depression has gotten so bad, my best friend has left me entirely."

I’m already 18 years old but I don’t know why the fuck I feel so desperate to be cared about by my friends and the people that I’m attached to.

It’s so unbearable I can’t take this pain anymore but I’m so scared because I’m like 99% sure I’ll kill myself but I’m terrified because it went horribly last time and I don’t want to fail

I’m so fucking pathetic and I don’t know what to do I’m scared that I’m going to kill myself"
435,1,"I don’t think I have a reason to be depressed. I think I have a fairly good life (good job, family, etc.) and know I could be worse off but for the past few months I’ve been feeling down. I tried distracting myself by buying things and trying to hangout with friends, but the past two weeks have gotten exponentially worse. I don’t have a desire to do anything. I don’t want to drink, go to work, watch anything, just nothing. This past week I cannot stop thinking about shooting myself. I keep trying to think of anything else but always come back to it. I’m even thinking about it at work where I should be focused and distracted from it. I can’t think of a reason to do it but I literally cannot stop thinking about it. I think I’m depressed and don’t know why."

439,1,"I didn’t expect to feel this shitty, I can’t sleep and I just feel this deep ache and so fucking depressed.  Idk what to do or who to even tell this to but I just can’t sleep. 

I’m tired and I’ve been trying to sleep for the past hour and a half and I just can’t. So I broke up with my boyfriend"
440,1,"When this year started, I had no clue that life was going to change this much. I expected another normal year with me trying and being depressed like the last few years have been.

In January, a few things happened and I decided to give my life a last chance. One year, that's all I gave myself. To be positive, to think positively, and no matter what happens, I'll keep moving forward to where I wanted to be in life. 

I started taking care of myself, mentally and physically. My health has significantly improved, and eating habits, exercise habits, sleeping habits have all gotten better. I didn't start all this from day one, I did them one by one. I have lost over 40 pounds since I started working out in February.

One of the things that motivated me was the perfect plan I had laid out for the year. I had failsafe plans to keep me going, incase one thing failed. I had things I wanted to do, things that I had to get over, the things that killed the person in me and started this whole downward spiral over half a decade ago.

Being mad at myself, no matter how unhealthy also helped. Mad at myself to not be able to speak to people, for not being confident enough, and for failing my younger self and not doing the things I loved. 

It's been fun, I've been the happiest I've been. The plan obviously didn't work out the way its supposed to be. 

Met the girl I liked and a few weeks ago told her I liked her. She was one of the reason that kept me going, even though I shouldn't have confessed to her until the end of this year. Things changed, we became good friends and well shit happened.

She likes me back, and last few weeks have been I have been the happiest I have been in years. Things were not all good, they got bad as well, but I kept going. Yesterday she decided she needed some time off to think and deal with her problems. Not the first time she brought up the topic, she kept suggesting we continue being friends because she didn't want to hurt me but I knew she liked me back and wanted to be with me. I told my good bye to her yesterday, giving her the space she needs. 

One of the reasons I am writing this post right now is to remind myself that life has its up and downs. My plan maybe fucked now, but I don't need the perfect plan to keep going. She might come back, might not. Thinking about it is scary, hoping for it will kill me. 

So many things have changed in the last few months, and I'm proud of how far I have gotten for a guy with anxiety and depression. Things can get better, all you have to do is to believe in yourself and force yourself no matter how down you are feeling. Only you can change your life. It's all in your mind.

Thanks for reading my rant. I don't know how I'm feeling, but I'll continue going. How much life can change in 6 months amazes me. Mind over matter."
441,1,"There is something very wrong with me deep inside.There is a deep sorrow and grief.However i look very normal,kinda neutral ,peaceful and calm on surface.I want to explode,intensity of emotions are so high that if they could be expressed physically i would cut with very long knife myself right through neck.However i dont know why,but i cant even cry.I am not on any antidepressedants.I try to cry but i cant. I realy want to,i try to force to express in any way but fail.My body calm by itself imidiately.I was forcing myself to cry and let whats inside go but i started laughing which looked even to myself bizzare like in horror movies.I feel very strong apathy.I know that things that bother me i cant never accept and live by nor i can change.I want to kill myself but i feel a little lazy now. Something is deeply wrong with me"
442,1,"When life smacks me in the face (like today) I refuse to eat. Yes, I’m hungry. My stomach is rumbling because I haven’t eaten in probably 30 hours now. I’m so hungry. But I will not eat. I don’t know if I’m punishing myself or what— I’ve never had an eating disorder. But when my family notices that I’m not eating they tell me to eat and I still won’t. It’s like I want someone to worry about me or care or even shove food in my mouth or something. I don’t know what the fuck my problem is. I’m crazy. I just wanted to throw this out there. Refuse to eat"
443,1,"Yep, that's who I am. I'm a good for nothing and I keep losing. I can't recall a single time in my life where I won anything.

I didn't win the genetic lottery. Nor did I win the social standing. I was raised by narcissistic parents. I was bullied in school and discriminated by my teachers. I was stabbed in the back by my so called friends. I was lied to and betrayed. And like a tool thrown away once I no longer served a purpose. I had a lot of dreams crushed by the expectations of my asshole family. I used to thrive for adventure and love. Now I just want my peace. I failed 2 jobs. I failed 3 different university courses. I have huge memory loss. I have a brain tumor. I am overweight due to stress. I'm also losing my hair and I'm only 22. What did I do to deserve all this injustice? What did I do to be such a failure? Great good for nothing loser"
444,1,"i really dont even want to go there because im convinced no one would take me anyway , like , literally , who would take me i am extremly  ugly  , i selfharm ( scratching my right arm ) no one would ever hire me anyway  , i just know its pointless to even do anything , i tried finding a job in 2016 , which resulted in 2-3 weeks in hospital , after a pneumoccal sepsis , and other issues i then had on the ICU ( like withdrawal symptoms from the painkillers they just stopped giving to me one day , and also other things ) ever since that i have been depressed which got worse and worse over the last 2 years , i dont even want to get a job , i know i would get fired after a few months , so really why should i even bother going there this friday i would have an appointment at a ""help center"" thing that could help me find a job , i dont even want to go there because its pointless anyway"
445,1,"My best (and only female) friend went through a breakup and got out of the rather toxic relationship she was in. She told me “I’m just going to delete everything and be alone for awhile. Sorry i lose.” 
She knows I’m always here for her but there’s not much more I can do for her.
I’ve been very depressed lately too. But she’s always been there to make me feel better. 
Is it my fault because I can’t do the same for her?

EDIT: I forgot to mention that she lived across the state from me and we always communicated via Snapchat. I don’t know what to do"
446,1,"I have a life that, on the surface, many would envy. I am a second year med student. I have friends who love and care for me. I have an awesome family that always supported me on everything. We don't have any financial problems. I could easily get a gf if I wanted to, I know there are girls that study medicine with me that like me.

But still, there are whole months where I cannot feel even remotely OK. It's always like that. A couple months where I feel relatively ok and a normally functioning person, followed by months where I fill like shit. As of now, I've been livng on something like 1000 calories a week for the past couple of weeks: I don't have the will to cook nor go to the supermarket to buy food. I haven't washed my hair in close to 3 weeks (but I manege to shower once a day in summer). I sleep on a bare mattress. I force mysef to brush my theet at least twice a week, and that's just because removing cavities causes me so much pain that it actually motivates me to an extent. My room, up to today, was basically a ""neckbeard nest"" (no food related things though, that's my rule. Not that I eat much anyway). I only partially cleaned it today because here it's too hot to stay with a closed door 24/24 and I felt too ashemed about the state of my room. When my housemates are eating all togheter, I cannot find the strenght to join them, but I feel ashamed about it so there has been whole days where I pretended not to be home. I cannot bring myself to study, and that's killing me because I know that this way I'll lose this year of university. I don't know how I will react to disappointing myself, my parents and staying behind all my fiends. About them, I am on the path of losing the strong bond we used to have. It's gettig rarer and rarer that I manage to hang out with them during my dark periods. I cannot even bring myself to play video games, my true passion beside medicine.

I can't bring myself to talk about my situation with anyone. I don't want to have even the slightest chance of being pitied by my friends. My parents would be really supportive and give me all the help I need, but I already have a gifted but troubled little brother and I don't want to give them any more worries. That's why I'm writing this.

I could find myself a  psychiatrist, but I don't have the willpower to. I have a really ugly, clearly self inflicted scar on my forearm. It makes me so ashemed that it's unbelievable. I feel like every people sees it and thinks...well, it's obvious what they think. I want to remove it so badly, I found online a good surgeon here but in a whole year and a half I never managed to convince myself on taking an appointment. This, alongside with the study thing and what's on the next paragraph, is what makes me the most disappointed in myself.

I can't help but feel whortless, a useless being not even capable of doing something that will for sure make him much happier (like removing the scar). And the worst part is that I feel like I'm wasting a life that someone else could have appreciated way more than I currently do. I really feel like a waste of a spot in a good family, a waste of time for my friends, a waste of a place in med school. There are so many people that deserve my life way more than I do. Or rather, that would make a way better use out of it.

Sorry for the long ass post, and sorry for my English. I hope noone that knows my username will see this post. If you do, please, refrain from talking to me about this. I think I'll delete this post in a few days, to male sure noone can see it from my profile. When you have the ""perfect life"", depression hits much worse."
447,1,"I am obsessed with my physical appearance, I am sure that I have body dysmorphia. I was complimented when I was younger for my looks, but around 12 years old I became a recluse, developed terrible depression, and became an outcast in society up to even now (I'm 21). Now I look at myself in the mirror and don't even know if I like what I'm looking at. Some days I hate the way I look and think I look just weird and disgusting, and if I were to be attractive it sure wouldn't be a conventional sort of attractiveness. I have slavic facial traits from my mother, I have a long face with no cheekbones and a chubby mouth area. I don't know how to stop being this shallow. I just want to stop caring. I want to have a personality, and have friends, but I feel like a hollow shell. Feels like my self worth depends on how I look"
448,1,"Yes there are days where I’m okay, where I can move and be able to have my depression not interfere with my day. But those days are less and less.  There are days where I have to drag myself out of bed to go to work. There are days where I sit in my car crying hysterically because I can’t do it. There nights where I sit with alcohol in front of me and a razor but I don’t touch because I cry myself to the point where I pass out. And no matter how much I force myself to think logically, to tell myself I will be okay, that I have friends and family there. I can’t stop thinking that they don’t need me. They don’t need a hysterical girl that wants to cut and drown herself in alcohol to ignore that emptiness in her chest. To just make the wild thoughts quiet just for a few hours.  So I think, maybe, maybe I should seek help, but I feel sacred. I feel sacred that if I do go and seek help, I’ll loose myself again. Because last time I tried medication, the doctors didn’t want to change it because I was “okay”, I just felt like a shell walking around and just doing life. I wasn’t living. And I’m sacred that’s going to happen again. And I’m so confused and I’m also so tired to the point of what’s worth living whe I can’t take care of myself? My debate on wether I should volunteer in admitting myself"
449,1,"I don't really know how to word any of this, but I finally saw my GP today about my mental health, and he told me I was depressed, and Lexapro would help me until I'm able to find work and get back to a healthy lifestyle. I've read a lot about the drug, and I've seen some people say it made them suicidal or worse as a side effect. I've never been at that point, and I don't want to be at that point. Am I right to worry? Nervous about Lexapro."
450,1,"I noticed that sometimes if I sleep well, I’ll wake up and have a few seconds of clarity. For that brief period, I feel at peace and my mind isn’t possessed by a storm of thoughts.

But then, after those few seconds, everything comes rushing back - the thoughts, the painful memories, the anxiety, the everything, and I’m back to feeling like shit. 

Does anyone else get that too? A few seconds of clarity after waking up."

452,1,Am 19F still living with my parents and unemployed and out of school. Not in the best mental place for the past month. I finally decide I should probably see a therapist and my parents get upset at me. They think I don’t need help. I feel sick and tired. I just want something to go right? I’m tired of being sad and I’m sometimes scared I’ll hurt myself. It’s extremely upsetting that they can’t even support me in a time like this. My parents suck
453,1,"How can my brain be in such turmoil and me not feel anything? I am so afraid that I’m going to slip into my numbness again. I can feel it creeping up on me. I feel absolutely alone in this world and a hassle to everyone who is in my life. I wish I could just die a natural death so no one has to deal with me and I don’t have to deal with me. I forget how much has happened to me, all the fights all the beating, all the tears, all of it contributing to my numbness. I wonder if I’ll ever feel differently. What is the point of getting up everyday? Was I put in this earth to suffer time and time again? Happiness was a rare occurrence for me, now I no longer feel anything at all. Just not feeling anything..."
454,1,"...and yet I fucked it up.

Everyone makes mistakes, yes, but when you're a mistake yourself and you find at least someplace where your existence is of any actual worth, you can't afford to make mistakes. 

And I made it. Cut myself to snap out of hysterical fit. I was so certain I could go without it - well that didn't last long.

Now I sit in a wet skirt that got smudged with my blood and don't know what else to do other than pray that the customer will overlook this mistake. It's unfixable and I have nothing to prove it was not my fault because I was too stupid to take any screenshots. 

Why does everything I touch break. Why am I such a failure at the simplest tasks.

I wish I died when there was a chance of replacement. My job is the only place where I'm any good"
455,1,"My depression is clearly affecting her and I don’t know how to stop it from screwing up her life.

It’s so fucking hard sometimes when you can’t go anywhere without being reminded that you’re alone. Just ERGHHH, why does life have to be so frustrating. I thought staying alive was about drinking water and eating berries, not being social. It’s a dumbass necessity and it drives me crazy.

459,1,"A little info about me: I'm just always depressed and have little to no motivation or energy for most of the day, I force myself to go to the gym almost every day because if i don't I'd likely end up going fucking insane sitting on reddit all day. I went to a trade school for welding and also took a college course, but I dont feel like im good enough for a welding job. I've also lost interest in welding and im not sure if its from depression or not. So now its I get a job in welding or I get some near minimum wage job and feel like an idiot for wasting so much money and time on something I used to love. 

sorry if this doesn't really belong here I just dont know what to do. how do you guys get a job?"

462,1,"Sometimes I get into ruts of thinking that none of my academic or professional endeavors even really matter because I know I'm going to kill myself really soon. And yet, I still try my best anyway. It's weird being a highly functional depressed person but not being functional makes me even more depressed and suicidal. Anyway, I've been going on interviews to land a job/internship (part of my school's curriculum) and I felt really good about the ones I went on and hoped that the ones I really liked would offer me a position. They didn't. Instead, I got chosen as a ""qualified alternate."" Went on Facebook and saw that one of my friends/peers/classmates got offered a spot at the place I wanted to work at really bad and I couldn't help but think how much I work my ass off, it never pays off. I'm always second best at everything and no one wants me. Employers don't want me, my friends probably don't even like me, and I'm afraid my boyfriend is going to break up with me soon because I can't stop living outside of my own head. Right now I really just want to give up and drop everything academic or job or profession related because none of it matters if no one wants me. And all I really want to do right now is cut myself because I know that's the only way I'll feel better. I can't stop basing my self-worth and happiness off of my academic and professional life"
463,1,"Idk who will see this. I don't expect much. I have learned a valuable lesson. I put my hope into someone. Again, and again and again. And again it looks like I'm a fucking dumbass. I don't want to be so filled with resentment and anger that i become something i can never recover from, but i don't think there's any other path i can go down. I think i have given up. I think i have accepted that i have lost the only person i had left who cared. Someone better came and she left. That's how it always goes, someone comes into my life and makes me feel cared. I don't open up but eventually i do. I put my hopes on someone, and it seems soon after they cut off that care. That attention i lack, somebody better comes and pow. She's gone. Every fucking time. I don't know what to do now, i want to die. I want to die so much, I've wanted to die for so long. I'm alone. And I'll die alone. I am now alone."

I went to pick up my refill and they said my insurance was inactive and I can’t afford the copay or the cost of check ups going forward without insurance. So, I’m back at square one. Actually worse. They say a sudden withdrawal can leave your brain more unbalanced than it was before. I’m broke. I have no job. I’m now going to be flung into an even deeper depression. Fantastic. I want to die"

473,1,"I don't have many friends, and the ones I do have are married with kids and stay home with their families. So I worked up the courage to clean up and go downtown to some bars by myself the past couple weekends.

It's just so hard to force myself to perk up and act like I feel good. No one wants to talk to the guy sitting at the bar by himself with a frown on his face. I drink enough to pick me up a little bit and start talking to people, but I can't seem to make it past small talk with anyone. I don't know how to keep a conversation going, my mind just goes blank after a certain point. I've lost interest in everything so it's hard to relate to people and their interests. I try being nice and giving compliments and such but that only goes so far when you don't know how to carry a conversation.

475,1,"Throwaway in case someone finds this 

A little background, I’m 19, on sertraline/Zoloft since I’m 15. Both of my parents have/had depression (one lost the battle). My other parent isn’t a great help. I did cut myself quite some times, but now I’m up to something... different...

I did ketamine the first time roundabout a year ago. A small dosage, nothing too special. 
However, every time I did it (4-6 weeks in between) the dosage became higher. A month ago I got to the point, where I could ""detach"" the part that hates me from the rest of my consciousness and talk to it... it was a really interesting way of dealing with myself. 

However, this is ABSOLUTELY NO ENCOURAGEMENT TO DO THIS. Simply because of (a lot of reasons. I can’t really recommend anyone getting into this. But especially) the next part: 

a week ago and said month ago I did the mistake of taking ketamine while I had a pretty hard down phase. 
It did made the down more bearable, but that’s what I feared. 
The last week was kinda fine, but the last days were terrible. And every time (even in the okay-ish week but especially for the last few days) I’m feeling even a bit down, I have the urge to do a lot of ketamine. Like, I don’t even care if it kills me. I just want to dissociate from my body, my life. Nothing like ketamine made my feel that way. Well, at least not that easy... I don’t think I’m really addicted (yet). I can survive without it, and i dealt with quite some stressful situations without it... but it feels so relaxing to not feel my empty body... my empty head... and I really want it...

My psychiatrist gave me some stuff to take instead when I’m feeling suicidal, but those are all terrible (not like ""in comparison with ketamine"", but even before I tried ketamine, I hated those)... so it seems for me this is my only escape from my miserable reality. Even though I know it’s not good in the long term... 

Anyone got experience here with getting addicted to drugs (especially ketamine) during depression? How did you get out? What medication could I ask my psychiatrist for, to get something to ""imitate"" ketamine (to get away from the illegal substance)? How do I not get deeper into this? Because I don’t think trying to resist will help for long... 

Thanks in advance Getting into an addiction..."
476,1,"I was in college, originally vet tech realized it wasn't my thing. I tried to do a major switch, but I became so stressed out. I'm the first one in my family to go to college and I was constantly bombarded with questions I couldn't answer. (From my family) I didn't know how the hell the college system worked. I ended up just not going to the last week of my first semester, out of stress. I stayed home crying those weeks. 

I still should get that sorted out as I'm still enrolled, I wanted to apply for other colleges but I feel too stupid. I often got yelled at by teachers because they got impatient with me when I was trying to understand the subject. 

Also I'm 20, I never really had a job. I've just been selling paintings and I'm a streamer. I also feel like I'm too stupid for a job anyways. I feel like I'm too stupid to be in this society. 

It just seems no matter what I do I am completely useless in it. I still regret going to the college my parents wanted me to be in. I lost my sense of self, I just do things for others because I'm never happy and just a waste of space. I feel so useless"
477,1,"I’ve been getting out of a nearly year-long depressive episode recently, and one of the most embarrassing habits I have is how unhygienic I get when depressed. But I took a shower for the first time in about a week just now, and I’m very proud of myself. 

I hope that everyone reading this can take pride in the small accomplishments you achieve. I’m trying to take a more positive approach to overcoming my depression. Instead of being grossed out about how I didn’t shower for a week, I’ll be happy that I was able to muster the energy to shower today.

But it is easier said than done. It’s hard to not feel disgusted at myself whenever I look in the mirror and see how I’ve gained 55 pounds (25 kg) in 6 months. Whenever I put on my big sweatshirt and sweats because I don’t fit into any of my other clothes anymore. Whenever I don’t study after class just so I can lie in bed and look on my phone.

But I’m getting better, slowly but surely. I’m finally getting into new hobbies (writing), being more involved in the fandom I love (Attack on Titan), and finding the energy play video games (Skyrim). It’s funny how playing video games is actually a win for me, but I used to be so unmotivated to do anything that I couldn’t even pull out my laptop and prop up some pillows. Even if I really wanted to play video games, I’d roll over onto my side and keep looking at my phone.

So even if it doesn’t look like it, I am getting better. Even if my dad doesn’t believe me, I’m getting better. Even if I don’t even believe myself sometimes, I’m getting better. And I hope whoever is reading this is getting better too. I took a shower and I’m proud of myself for it"
478,1,"Over the past 30 years, I’ve dealt with my bouts of depression with self help books, videos, spirituality, meditation, medication, therapy, exercise, diet, etc...  and they have all helped.  BUT it always comes back.  And every time I know it’s coming I get so scared.  That hole is so deep and dark that I was always afraid that I may never come out again.  
I feel like this is the time I’m not coming out.  I’ve lost touch with even the smallest scrap of Will to use any of my tools.  
This time my depression is different.  Apathy has consumed my being.  It’s taken meaninglessness to a new level.  
Why get better? It will surely return.  It’s the slipping into a depressive episode that’s the hardest.  It’s the helplessly watching my hopes slip away and the dread of what’s to come that makes it so awful.  It’s losing all over again.  And again and again and again.  That part is always the most painful.  Once I’ve settled into the episode, I’m numb and can’t feel loss or sadness.  Just numb.  It’s not great but it’s better than having hope then losing it.  
But like I said this time is different.  I don’t have the gut feeling.  The one one that screams and scratches for help.  The one that makes you so uncomfortable that you’re desperate for a remedy.   It’s not there.  I feel completely empty. I don’t even want to fix myself anymore"
479,1,"Hello all, kinda quick question, my friend was feeling really depressed and just now told me an hour or so ago he took 2 extra prozac pills

the dose is 40mg, on top of the normal dose he took this morning, equalling 120mg if my math isn't shit

is this too much?

should I urge him to seek medical help or? How much prozac is too much?"

481,1,"I literally only sit at home 24/7 on my PC, no talents, no friends or girlfriend because autism and being ugly, used to have one friend who was the best person i've ever met in my entire life but he died in a car crash. Should i just finally end it?"
483,1,"I had a rough year last year. I had just finished training in my profession and was chosen to stay on as an instructor, I was on top of the world. In my field this position is highly coveted and in a sense leads to competitive placement in further training or job offers. But the year was a disaster. Overnight I became a social outcast for reasons I couldn't understand. A whole department of people treated me like a pariah. Later in the year it came out that one (possibly more) of my co-workers seemed to have been subtly turning people against me. Would say things like I was making fun of her husband for his medical issues (which is ridiculous and a fabrication). But for some reason, everyone got their pitchforks and socially ostracized me. I moved on to further training after a year.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I've found myself extremely distrustful of people. I get very anxious in mild social situations to the point I withdraw/avoid. I no longer talk to friends, hang out with anyone, play basketball, or text/call. Fast forward another year, finished first year of training, everything is worse. I enjoy nothing anymore. I avoid going home, but also avoid doing work. Coworkers think I'm a joke. I'm bullied, made fun of, told to ""fuck off"" at times, used as the end of practical jokes where I'm the one who gets in trouble. My wife left to go on a trip with her friends on my birthday, which happened to fall on the first day off I've had in weeks. I've become someone that everyone doesn't care about kicking around.

&amp;#x200B;

I've considered leaving my training program, but that wouldn't fix my social isolation, in fact would probably make it worse. I can't think of anyone that treats me with respect, admiration, or even basic decency. There just isn't anyone, anywhere who gives a shit. It's like I have a scalet letter on my forehead which says ""treat him like garbage, it's fun and nobody cares if you do"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been to therapy, I'm not sure how that's supposed to help. Talking about it just makes me miserable for a full 24 hours after. I've tried medication, that doesn't make people like you.  I don't feel like there is any fixing this, I think I'll be treated like this the rest of my life. If I quit my job or get a divorce, I think it'll all get worse. Wits end. Wits end"
484,1,I don’t know how often I yet have to explain everything and my mom just won’t leave me alone with it I‘m so fucking tired How do you handle parents not understanding anything about depression?
485,1,I keep relapsing pretty badly and it just gets worse and worse each time. I hate my head more than anything in the world and I’m sick of how self destructive I am. I’ve ruined so many opportunities mostly because of my mental health and it just builds up man I don’t do anything with my life other than blast music and occasionally text friends and sleep and I’m hardly motivated to take care of myself anymore. hopeless
486,1,"I'm genderfluid, and I feel so ashamed of it. No one believes that this even exists. If I seriously told anyone around me they'd probably just laugh. I hate myself because of it. I feel like a girl half the time and I look like a fucking ugly fat man... Even though I truly believe that it's oppressive to think this way about anyone else, I still think this way when it comes to me. I don't think I'll ever really come out because no one will take it seriously in my lifetime. It probably doesn't help that I've already been met with constant rejection and hatred even with stuff outside of being genderfluid. I should probably kill myself haha you know if I had a gun, I would have done it a long time ago and I'd definitely have had a better legacy than I do now :) All my friends left me :) All my past partners left me :) Why shouldn't I leave me? :) I hate myself and my life and everything lol"

I'm unemployed too right now too. Literally I might as well not exist. Absolutely nothing would change. I'm a nobody and I hate it..."
488,1,"This is one instance, but it upset me greatly. We (my best friend, my second eldest brother, my eldest brother, and myself) were playing Uno and having fun, and my eldest brother (who is about eight or so years my junior) kept calling me school shooter throughout the game. I ignored it initially, not easily, but I did. But he just kept calling me it. It got to the point where I was already frustrated with the game and sick of getting called school shooter, so I just said ""Stop calling me that. It seriously isn't funny."" So, what would any good older brother do in this situation? He called me it again. So I said ""Dude, it's not even funny."" Then my second eldest brother chimed in and mumbled ""School shooter"". I was severely upset at this point, so I layed my cards down on the table and said ""I'm done"" and walked away. That's the end of it, right? No, of course not. This I'd r/depression, why would it end there? I walked out into the other room and sat down just to hear them call me names. They called me ""triggered"" and ""butthurt"". Even my bestfriend did. My best friend told them how I usually act when I get upset at him, telling my brother that facetiously, practically making fun of me. It went on for almost ten minutes. My best friend is the only person I can usually feel solace around, knowing I don't have to fear the possibility of my feelings being crushed. This just proved that it isn't the case. He made fun of me with my brothers. It really, really hurt. I feel so alone right now. Nobody was there to defend or make me feel better. It was all just calling me names and stuff. For all I know, my best friend talks about me behind my back all the time. At this point, I wouldn't doubt it. My eldest brother eventually came in the room and said sorry, saying he wouldn't do it again. I said ""it's ok, just please leave me alone."" Then, of course, he walks back to my brother and friend and calls me ""butthurt again"". Saying ""if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen"". Whether it was a joke or not, it hurt me, and get they still called me ""school shooter"" and made fun of me for getting upset. I feel more alone than I have in a while. I get that I'm troubled, but I'm not a goddamn school shooter. I hate myself. My brothers kept calling me school shooter."
489,1,"So, I have a girl friend (not girlfriend) and I kinda have a crush on her. I want to ask her out, but platonically, and not like a date. She also has problems and frequent depression episodes and I'm afraid that she'll reject me. I have a feeling that she is also into me, but I don't know. Anyway, I'm afraid that she'll reject me and that it will send me and her into a bad episode. I'm in a good period right now and I don't want it to end any time soon. Do I ask her or not? Again, not like a date, but platonically. Also, if it means anything, I don't want her to stop her contact with me. It would leave me alone. I want to ask a friend out, but I'm afraid that it will pull me back into depression"
490,1,"Due to my parent's negligence during my childhood up to highschool, my parents didn't really take me to the dentist even when I begged to go, as well as when I had medical problems as well, they never wanted to take me at all. Fast forward to today, turning 23 real soon, I finally got my life together and have been getting my medical stuff done, last year I had to to extract one tooth due to it being broken since middle school, failed root canal for one time my parent finally took me after days of pain and crying, and begging. Now, I have to get two more extracted. I am so heartbroken, I've always religiously brushed my teeth but none of that helped since the damage from childhood was far too great. My teeth are too weak for cavities from sweets so that's another thing I have to give up even though I don't always eat. They have to sedate me after I figure out when they'll schedule it, extract two teeth then finish up the rest of cavities from when I continuously vomitted for a good 3 years due to illness. ☹️ 



TLDR; 
1 tooth extracted, now 2 more as adult despite religiously brushing, flossing, and mouthwash. 
Most of the damage from my teeth were from how sick I got and my parents failed to take me to get better back in childhood that now as an adult am suffering from their negligence. I live states away from them as I ran away after highschool for a better life for myself which I've been progressing on. Just got done with neck surgery twice. Very extremely sad today (triggering)"

493,1,"I ask myself every day.

Why am I even doing this? How did it even get this bad? Why can't I have the same passion as I did back then? Who am I doing any of this for? 


More questions. I wish I could go back. It's been 3 months since I started working full time since graduating high school 4 years ago. In that time, I've met dozens of people, making many temporary friendships. I've traveled hundreds of miles, and spent time with friends I'll never see leave my life, all over the states. I've learned new skills, gained new hobbies, and spent a lot of time learning about myself and what I don't want to do after I get out of school.


But most importantly, in those past few years, I've failed. Failed miserably. Completely, and utterly, bombed the chances I had of floating my way to my degree. Now I live with my parents, work a full time job making $10.50 an hour, and have no time to pursue my hobby. No time to pursue my career. No time to invest in meaningful relationships in real life. No time to properly discipline my mind so I can properly take care of my body.


I failed for the last time last fall, when my grandmother passed away. I didn't recover academically, and lost access to financial aid. Technically I can get it back, but not all of it. I've been failing before for 3 years but am 70% complete with my degree. I am 30k in debt, and owe $400+ a month in loan repayment until I go back to school. But I don't know how I can afford to go back when I've failed so hard. 


I failed because I didn't have the will to stay the course. I delude myself that if I wasn't killing my will to live and thrive and achieve my goals by grinding myself into this full time job I hate, I wouldn't have any of the problems pursuing my goals. 


But I failed before without the 50+ hours dedicated to my job. I failed before I finally found a fulfilling hobby that made me feel happy and gave me a purpose and reason to get up in the morning. I failed to keep my passion for that hobby alive while working the job and trying to stay positive.


I do nothing but fail. I have my parents as witness as they see me break down over simple things every month and scold me for not appreciating how lucky I am and making the most out of a shitty situation like they have their entire lives. 

I have my only real life friend as witness as he works next to me every day at the job he got me hired at, trying to act like I care but doing the bare minimum in hopes that I can squeeze on by until I can go back to school in spring.(another delusion I have)

I have my dozen or so friends I used to DM for weekly as witness ask constantly cancel sessions and stress to them about how stressed I am, and how little time I have to dedicate to the hobby.

I have every person that enters my life as witness as they see me go through these moments at random and unfortunate times and simply disappear because they don't want me. 

I have myself as witness as I waste away my free time laying in bed or playing videoganes, motivationless, until it's time to drag myself back to my stressful and draining job, pretending that if I just Survive long enough things will eventually sort themselves out. 


I fail every day and ask myself: what am I even doing anymore? Who am I even surviving for ? Will they even accept my failures when I find them? When they find me? 

When will I stop failing? When will the passion and motivation come back? When will I wake up every day and perform every action with purpose? 


I'm afraid the answer is never. What am I even doing anymore?"
494,1,"I don’t even really want to die ever anymore, or do anything. I just kinda drag day to day putting up an act pretending that I’m a happy comedic dude. It hurts existing man, walking talking having to listen to other people’s problems and feeling selfish when I share my own. Shit just hurts. A year or two back I had a heartbreak which isn’t really related but it was around then I realized since it didn’t kill me I felt nothing. Now nothing really makes me feel anything, fear of anything other then death doesn’t even exist anymore. Don’t get me wrong I do want to live. Every day I’m striving to find meaning, doing my daily task so my life doesn’t become harder then it already is. But man I feel like a goddamn robot, I even laugh at myself, I can’t even tell if I’m subconsciously faking for attention I don’t know if that’s what I even want. I don’t know what I want.

He says no, but I know I am. i have no money, I'm physically unable to do a lot around the place. I'm fat, I'm poor, I'm nuts, how can I not be a burden?

And today we got a notice that mgt wants to remodel some of the units in our building, including ours. They've invoked our 60 days, so we need to be out by the first of September. Which means trying to scrape up enough money for deposit and first month's rent, all of that. I don't know how it's going to happen, and I'm scared. My anxiety is kicking into high gear, I'm sick to my stomach and I just want to crawl into bed and never come out again. 2 months to find a place, pack our things, get the money to move and get moved. And now I don't just feel like a burden, I feel like an anchor, weighing him down. Making everything harder than it should be.

501,1,"I feel completely lost in space. My brain is misfiring constantly. Over the past week I’ve been so sexually aroused I can’t sleep without masturbating like 3 times. Sex is all I can think about I can’t even focus on work. At the same time I feel dizzy, have no memory and feel so fucking low and empty inside I can barely keep on. I left work today cause I just couldn’t stand to be there , such a shitty fucking thing to do but I couldn’t stomach it. I get these unreal highs where my brain shoots out all the feel good chemicals all at once for a day or so and I feel so fucking amazing, I even look beautiful in the mirror and I am so good at my job. Then I come crashing down to where I either don’t eat or binge eat, am extremely tired but can’t sleep, highly irritated and dull brained and it lasts a lot longer then the highs. The only things that help are booze, weed and masturbation. I don’t have a sexual partner and it’s killing me. I do things to be healthy , I eat somewhat healthy , I do yoga 5 times a week usually , I walk instead of drive everyday. I just can’t go on right now I feel buried under layers of sadness, trauma, pressure from career and people around me. I’m so ready to crack. I don’t remember a time where I felt good,  my whole life ive been insecure, anxious, self hating and overboard self medicating.

502,1,"Nothing in my life is going right. It seems that the universe is constantly against me. All I wanted to do was to wait until night time, swim straight out into the ocean so far that I would never be able to make it back. It would be clean, easy and probably the only way I would want to go.

After crying my eyes out for what seemed like hours, I got up and just made a cup of coffee. Even though my list of things to do seemed to go on forever, if all I would do today was make this coffee it would be a plus.

And I don’t know if something answered my prayer but I feel so much better. It’s nice knowing this community is here to vent to but it is unhealthy stalking this sub. 

If you feel like absolute shit, just try to get up out of bed and do one thing for yourself. Not a chore, not work, but one thing that might just make you a little more relaxed and it might get you out of this funk. The key to my depression has to always been to keep busy. If I kept myself preoccupied for so long I wouldn’t have time to think about my depression. But then other times it’s hard to get the ball moving. And when you’re low, you’re really low.

So even if you just do it for me, try getting up and making a cup of coffee. This morning I had a panic attack"

* I always stay up as late as I can, because I don't want tomorrow to come around
* I always get up as late as I can, because I don't want the day to start
* I have never had a girlfriend, or dated anyone past a few weeks
* My room is a complete mess, and I keep saying I can deal with it later
* I am not very well connected with family, and don't have many friends

&amp;#x200B;

On the positive side though,

* I have a full time job - 50 hours a week
* I go dancing every week (the only thing that makes me happy)
* I just bought some new clothes, and got a haircut
* I have a idea for where I want to be in the future How do I improve myself out of bad habits, and a bad mindset?"
506,1,"I know, atleast for me, this is one of the hardest things to rationalize and justify doing, but I can't ignore the obvious effect it has on me when I do. I couldn't begin to tell you how it makes things better because I don't know and it very legitimatley does not. All I can say it definitley does is serve as a fleeting distraction from mental pain, making you focus on the physical. But that doesn't explain the genuine euphoria and relief I feel when I do those things. I don't know if thats how other people feel but I've finally found a real substitute that gives you everything you want out of self harm without any violence towards yourself. Im very probably not even the first person to say this here but you just need another physical diatraction that over stimulates your senses. Specifically for me, every time I've wanted to hurt myself for the past month I've just thrown myslef on the ground and done push ups and sit ups until I literally can't continue. Use any exercise you want, as long as that shit starts to burn. It very much is still hurting yourself in the most literal way, the pain youre bringing on yourself however is productive and benificial. And I can whole heartedly say that the euphoria I feel is so much stronger and deserved. Get down and physically use your muscles to climb out of the psycological hole you're in. You'll recive your catharsis and better yourself in the process. Like a controlled burn in a forest so it can come back more lush, youre doing less harm to yourself for more with a clear goal in mind. Instead of just razing the place and hoping to get what youre after. So when you want to ache for whatever reason, just push yourself past what you think you can do, and there wont be any room for bullshit in your head. 

I don't love you all, I hate when people say that, but I feel for everyone who hurts and I want as many of you as possible to get better in any capacity. How I deal with the overwhelming desire to self harm, hopefully it can help you"

510,1,I’m so used to cutting everyone off and disappearing. This is how I used to cope with my depression but now that I’m in therapy I’ve realized what I’ve been doing was wrong. I don’t want to do this anymore but my mental health is declining and it’s getting so hard to communicate with anyone. I know it’s the depression that’s making me isolate myself but it’s so much harder now that I’m self aware. I feel like such a horrible person for feeling this way and I feel guilty for doing this in the past. Do you ever just want to cut everyone out of your life and run away?
511,1,"First of all I already know some of you make thing this is a silly or stupid thing to be asking advice about but know that this is a serious issue that has been going on for about 3 weeks now. So it all started with overdoing it on eating an edible about 3 week ago. I took a 30 mg edible which by the way I hardly smoke so it’s very rare. Anyways since I took more than I was supposed to eat I obviously had a really bad trip. Non stop panic attacks and feeling like I was going to die. A week later my panic attacks were still there. Some of the symptoms that I was experience while on the edible I was still experiences but just in more mild way such as slurred speech, being insecure of what I’m saying, feeling like I’m not present, slightly dry mouth, over sensitive of my tongue. For example when I was having my bad trip my whole attention was on my tongue not feeling normal so I feel like I pay a lot of attention to it while I’m talking and it’s frustrating. I’m not saying the marijuana caused all these symptoms but I feel like my anxiety is causing me to think I still have them. But what i want to know is of anyone has ever experienced this before. BTW I’ve had anxiety most of my life but never this bad to a point where it’s making me despeessed. Do you think I will ever feel like my old self. I need some reassurance:( Have felt depressed and anxious ever since I ate an edible"
512,1,"I can't connect with people. I always thought that this was bad and unusual and strange, but once I broke down and talked to my other depressed friends, I found out they felt the same way too. When I say this, I mean that I feel hollow about my friends. I don't care about them much and if they died I don't think I would be very affected (of course until the day that it all hits me in the face and I can't repress it anymore). It was just information for me when my depressed friend said to me that she didn't care about me either and didn't expect the same from me. She said that she would support me and she knows I would do the same but the connection is not there. We stay together as ""friends"" because we need each other sometimes when we are unhappy and we know that having is friends is what you are supposed to do. I know I'm repressing the emotions tied to when she said she didn't care about me, but I can't really stop so I just roll with it. In case you think we aren't friends in the traditional sense, it's all the same except the emotional connection. We hang out, help each other, talk to each other daily via text and call, and try to have good times together. The problem is that we are doing it all with no emotions for the other person. It's the difference between loneliness and being alone. We aren't alone, but we are very lonely. We thought being with other people would lessen that, and maybe it did and we just don't realize.

I have emotional connections with my family, but maybe that's because I'm around that so much that I just got used to them always being there. I love my brother and my sister and my aunt I think I love my mom and I know I love my dad. That last one is an issue because he's a depressed autist and we can't talk or communicate for jack shit.

This brings me to the point. I want to find a guy who I'll make family. I'm gonna marry this guy and we are gonna have sex every day and travel around and cook for each other and have a lot of cute little babies and be each other's best friend. I want to fall in love with my best friend and then I want to make him family. But how do I have an emotional attachment with a friend at all? How do I make them my best friend? How do I progress to a point that makes me want to have them join my family? I'll love him if he's family but I want to love him before that point, and even if I didn't care about that it would still be important to sustaining a relationship with him.

And if I get that far, what will he think of my mental illnesses? That phrase by itself is just bad news brewing. It's a writing prompt for a horror story-- ""what will [romantic partner] think of my mental illnesses?"" That opens the door for violent schizophrenia or strange bipolar disorder when in most cases schizophrenics aren't violent and bipolar people just have very very quick and intense mood swings. And that stigma just sorrounding the phrase demonstrates my point. What will he think of me? Will he fetishise my depression and anxiety like those fuckers on the internet or just think I'm joking. What's he gonna say when he sees my antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. What's he gonna do if the mom of his kids can't get up in the morning to help his children get ready for school, much less kiss them on the cheek? What's he gonna think if I tell him what it's like? He would leave me if he's sane. Maybe there's a guy out there willing to put up with my shit because he loves the rest of me so much (but why would he even do that?) but this is 2019. Realisitically, unless he wants to give himself a pat on the back for marrying a crazy lady he, this is fictional man who sounds so good hell get a pick of anyone he wants, he won't marry me. The odds aren't in my favor. Now I get the guy falls in love with depressed chick trope. Everyone loves to root for the ones who logically don't get to win. At this point I'd give anything to meet this Knight in Shining Armor. I am a romantic but I don't think I can have love"
513,1,SOmone fucking kill me please i just want to fucking die i need to fucking end my life i hate this i hate being alive i hate everything about myself and i cant live with this stupid fucking brain the doctors said i was fine but i dont think i am im so fucking numb and erratic and im losing all my friends because they dont want to hang out with someone who cant control their anger i hate it i hate it someone please just help me fucking die i want to disappear into the fucking night i want to end my life i want to end my fucking life please someone help me end my life please i just need to go i have to go i want to go i need to go i need to go please please please please please
514,1,"I don’t want to say that my break up caused my depression. Its been 3 weeks since it happened and really i feel lonely of course but depressed? I dont think so, ive come to the point where I can understand my “off days” vs me starting to become depressed and me distinguishing being sad vs being depressed. What I really need to understand is how to be independent again. How to feel like im able to be alone, but not be lonely. 

Ive talked to multiple close friends and theyve all said that I should just drink, smoke, party. I really dont want to fall down that path because I know the moment i come off that high the moment i become sober the moment the party is over? Im gonna be the same if not worse. Im not in it for a short term recovery, I want to be able to improve myself and better myself not only for whenever I meet another lover, but in general for myself, my family, my future. 

Im going to be honest the way I am right now I dont necessarily fear being alone, but I also do. My close girl friend asked me why do you not want to be alone? You’ve always been the type to work perfectly fine alone, be alone, and do things ALONE. Then i thought well really I dont want to be left alone with my thoughts. Ive been up for the past 3 hours not being able to sleep because of racing thoughts. Im exhausted but just cant seem to fall asleep. Yes i am alone right now as i am writing this, but i feel fine. But im sacred of the fact that when i start to try to fall asleep my thoughts will keep me up. (Please feel free to leave any thoughts and advise on how to overcome that feeling) 

I really do want to get better. I really do want to be able to wake up everyday to say that im independent and that I really dont’ need another companion to make me happy. It all starts with self love, but how do I start to love myself? I really have been boosting my own confidence saying that Im the best she’ll ever have, its her loss, im a great guy she took me for granted, etc all the self loving boosters you can think of. But i still feel like it isnt necessarily helping so thats why im reaching out to all of you to wake me up and realize that I can get through this, and that I am fine all by myself and that I dont need another person to make me feel special. Trust me i do understand that its all progress, and that I wont be able to just say im fine and then be fine, but does repetition truly help? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this please feel free to leave any advise on any of the feelings i mentioned I really do deeply appreciate it. Also, try to have a wonderful day why dont ya ;) Any advise will help and is deeply appreciated"
515,1,"Quickly I'll say this I feel horrible for son, because I've had to pawn his Xbox and.phone because I'm too depressed to work which adds more on and everyone else just says I'm lazy!! Feeling horrible for my son!"
516,1,"Since my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me, life haven’t been the same. All i want to do is fall a sleep and hope i wake up one day and just be happy for once. I sat a goal for myself to attend “Roskilde festival” in Denmark, im now 3 days in and i have been home more than at the festival. And when im at the festival i can’t do anything but think about how nice it would be to be home with my dad and my puppy.
Why can’t i just enjoy something for once?
Please help, i hate being this sad all the time and just want to be happy and enjoy life.

Sry for my bad english. Another thing i suck at apperently. What am i doing with my life? Not even at festival can make me a little bit happy"
517,1,"Basically what the title says. I've always been dealing with depression, but I manage it with medication, hobbies and school. Outwardly I'm doing okay. 4.0 gpa, job in my field, cute dog, an apartment downtown.

I met this guy who was basically perfect for me. We had an amazing relationship. Then out of the blue he texts me to tell me he's leaving me - for his ex (who had lied to him about being married for two years, and once called him 25 times in an hour despite knowing that we were dating). She had been trying to get him back since we started, and she did, so...I guess she wins.

I can feel my grades slipping. I haven't looked at schoolwork. I've basically just been alternating between crying, lying in bed and being high.

I'm gonna die alone. Everyone eventually realizes that they don't want me after all. I'm too sad and pathetic and I'm good at hiding it at first, but they eventually find out. My ex dumped me over text. Depression came back full force."
518,1,"i dont have a s/o or anyone close enough to physically be there for me when things get bad. i occasionally have verbal comfort by one of my friends, but i wish i could have someone here with me to help. someone right by my side, literally, that i could just pour all my thoughts out to. this makes me really want a dog or cat or something, but i dont think i could afford it, and my sister is allergic as fuck. i just cant wait till im living on my own and financially stable enough to have a pet. i need a physical connection with someone, something, anything i really want a pet"
519,1,I'm so depressed and my family and friends are giving up on me getting better. Therapy and medication doesn't seem to do anything. What's the point anymore? I'm going to die alone probably. Alone and depressed
520,1,"After struggling for years with what could only be described as crippling, debilitating depression, in recent years I’d finally consider myself well-managed and more or less recovered (until the next episode but let’s enjoy this while it lasts). 

Unfortunately, however, from my worse years my personal hygiene suffered greatly. Not brushing my teeth regularly, showering only once every week (or two), etc. While I’ve improved greatly in that department, I still don’t feel like I take as much care of myself as I should. Does anyone have any tips on forming new and better habits in this department? Tips for improving hygiene?"
521,1,"I literally feel nothing. I’m currently a 15 y/o boy who has lost 7 family members in the past 4 or 5 years. I always wanted a word to describe what I felt (nothing) and only just found out about melancholia and what it is. I come from a well off family with great parents and a great sister but no friends or hobbies. Which I hate to admit to my parents. When I mention depression to my parents or anything like; how I have the inability to communicate with anyone they just shut me down and say it’s just life but whenever I look outside or when I’m at school I see people smiling and laughing which I haven’t done in years without forcing myself to do so. I also haven’t cried in several years no matter what happens; friend dying of cancer: nothing; musician who I deeply respect and admire, dying: nothing. I used to try and open up to my parents but they just put it down to being a teenager but I think it’s more than that. Any thoughts if you’ve experienced depression or melancholia? Thank you for taking the time to read. Melancholy?"
522,1,"Nothing and I mean nothing ever seems to go right. I thought this current boyfriend was it but he doesn’t get where I’m coming from. I’m very insightful, I always have been, so I get his point of view on that majority of things. I understand because understanding someone so “normal” is so easy. I turn to my friends and realize I have none that will give me any solid advice aside from “oh I feel that”. I’m on my last limb. I can never get the same effort I put in out of someone and maybe I’m just expecting too much. Or maybe that’s just my situation. That’s just it. What do I do? My depression and anxiety are going to kill me. I honestly feel like I’m a waste of space."

524,1,"I can't stand being around them,whenever I start feeling better I see these people and it makes me feel lonely and horrible,it makes me remember that I don't have anyone,my day got ruined because of this,now I'm sitting in a park alone hoping that someone I know will come,no matter how low the chance of that happening is Anyone else hate being around other groups of friends?"
525,1,I feel so numb. I just want to cry so I can actually feel something. Anything. I definitely can't be happy but I'd rather be sad than just feel so empty. how do I cry?
526,1,"I see a therapist that is $185 per session. I see her once a week. She knows money is tough for me and actually LOWERED her rate to that. The only reason I can afford it is because my insurance pays some of it. My parents and I split the rest. 

My dad is weird about money. He randomly starts to want me to pay for something, but won’t TELL me that’s what he wants. Instead he just complains to my mother until she tells me. And then he gets mad, like I should’ve somehow known. Just recently, my mom said he doesn’t want to help me pay for therapy anymore. This, despite the fact that he wanted me to go back to therapy in the first place... (I’ve only been back in therapy for like 5 months.) 

She told me to not say anything until he says something to me, in the hopes that he’ll never actually bring it up. But it sucks. I’m struggling so much and it’s like he doesn’t even care. My dad wants to stop helping me pay for therapy."
527,1,Sometimes it just hits me like a truck and I start bawling my eyes out the kind of crying you do when someone dies but they feel.. empty. It’s like you just sit there crying and crying waiting to feel any type of emotion. Do you ever just cry empty tears?
528,1,"I just hope it's better than this Does anyone else want to die not just because life sucks, but also to see what happens after death?"
529,1,"I’m a failure.. I’m 18 and I finish school at the end of the week and I have 0 plans at all for after summer no university or anything planned... and I just look at where people I used to know are and they all have everything planned out... and I have nothing

It’s kinda like what’s the point in being alive? Iv always done rubbish at school have 0 friends and am literally a waste of space

I think about this a lot like if I die how will it improve other people’s life’s? If I was dead parents could move on and have more time to them selfs... they would not be wasting money on me and that would make them happier... and it’s also not like I have any friends so I’m pretty much worthless then because me being dead makes my parents life’s better in every way.

Tbh I feel I’m just a let down to everyone.. my parents wanted me to just be normal and have friends and get good grades.. and I’m just a failure I have no grades and  no friends... coming to think about it I bring nothing good to anyone and everyone would be better off without me 

Tbh if I killed myself I don’t see anyone even caring... why should they... they loose nothing only me and that will make them happier 

I’m sorry for wasting your time
I’m sorry for everything I’m a failure that no one wants"
530,1,"How is it that I'm able to advice people in a similar situation as me but fail to follow it myself? It's just so frustrating. Especially to see this person take the advice and move forward in life.

Been feeling like I've really wasted the past 5-6 years doing nothing even though I finished my post graduate degree, got a job, yada yada. Every time I want to learn something new and I plan out my day, I fail to follow it which makes me even more frustrated. 

I've been told that I'm just lazy and have no goal in life. That I don't have any ambition and I'm not who they thought I'd  be. That I'm not the same person. I hate this depression. Why me? If not for this medication that I'm taking, I think I'd be crying at home non stop. I'm going mad... in my head. And no one knows about it. No one understands. Just a rant..."
531,1,"So backstory I quit a nice paying job because of physical (and mental) health issues and started working at a part time job while I look for somewhere else, and its boring...its so boring and easy I want to quit already, but no where I apply to gets back to me. My dumb brain likes to think that I'm a failure because no where wants me, I don't know how to get over this dumb reason. Can anyone else relate? Do you ever feel like a faliure because of one dumb reason?"
532,1,"“Toughen up” they always say
“Start fixing yourself” they say 
“Stop living in a dramatic play”

So I say, I’m fine when I’m not okay,
I paint fake colors when everything is gray,
an eternal dismay of wanting to say I’m not okay but fearing I’ll be cast astray.

So say, when tonight I lay, 
this fray, I’ll die in today.
I hope you remember the words I say,
I hope you know there could have been a way. 




Writing is all I have left and I just wanna share it A short poem"
533,1,"So my now ex broke up with me like 3 weeks ago and got back together with me 2 weeks ago and I broke things off yesterday mainly because he literally drained the life out of me and he never did nice things for me. 
I know my depression gets bad if I don’t manage it and we talked about that and I began going to therapy and taking medication and again and I got better expect for when I saw him cause every time we hung out he looked miserable and it would make me upset. When I would ask him why he looked that way he would always say it’s cause of my depression. 
I feel like it’s my fault even though people tell me it’s not. 
The day I called him to break up he was playing Xbox and didn’t even stop his game to talk, he just kept playing and before I told him I wanted to break up he said to me that I can’t run to him with all my problems because he’s not my babysitter and that getting back together with me was a mistake. 
I just want other people’s perspective. Part of me knows he’ll tell everyone that I was the crazy one but it’s because I get so easily irritated when I get depressed but we knew that. But every problem I had was never taken seriously he would just tell me I was depressed or insecure when I knew I wasn’t. 
I know the difference between upset and depressed. Relationship/ depression advice or help"
534,1,My long distance partner didn't wish me a happy birthday today we've been talking like usual but they just never brought it up i went on social media and saw them posting about their upcoming birthday and what they want partner forgot birthday
535,1,"So I’m on my summer break from college. My mom was comparing me to my school’s students who are oreintation advisors after she saw an FB post about them. She went and said how they’re doing something with their life and I’m not. During the summer the school employs students for the new student oreintation. Its a leadership position. And to get most leadership positions you have to be known or a favorite. Which isn’t fair because there could be unqualified people in this job. 

Anyways, I’m going into my junior year and I am majoring in cyber security and my minor is in computer science. I work at an IT help desk at school. I love my job there and I feel like it’s my second home. I have such funny coworkers who make my day.   

I’m not saying that these orientation advisors are unimportant because they are important, but being an IT assistant at my school is a much more harder and demanding job. We deal with professors and students. It feels like no matter what I do to help others, I never get a thank you and I can’t be put on a pedestal since I’m no “student leader”. Starting next semester I’ll be a club officer for my school’s cyber security club where we learn ethical hacking skills.  So that’s at least a leadership position that will be helpful to me. 

I struggle with depression from day to day. I feel insecure  a lot and i feel ugly. At times I don’t even feel appreciated. I went to vocational school for IT and I was put down there a lot for my choice into going into the IT shop simply because I’m a very feminine girl and still am. Since then, I’ve always had this sense of worthlessness that no matter what I did, I would never be important or do anything big enough. 

I often feel like I won’t do anything big or important enough in my future. I want to work in the aviation industry or the government for cyber security work. Right now I work at a dollar store for the summer and it’s the worst place ever. It’s hard finding an IT job at my age unless it was like an internship or an entry level job, unfortunately none are around me at the moment. I do have a certification that’s good for an entry level job. I’m considering leaving my dollar store job because i feel like I do not have the brain to be in retail. I’m around so much negativity I feel so bad about myself. 

What hurts is my mom telling me how I’m not doing anything with my life. My major is one of the hardest at my school and so is my minor. I have a dead end part time job at a dollar store. And I am taking an online summer course for my major and I plan on getting certified for what the course is based on next month. I’m also going towards to getting my license. How do I deal with a parent that compares me to others? Mom compares me to others"
536,1,"ETA: please don't message me if you want a ""cougar"" or quick hook up!!! Not into that shit


I am so tired of trying to do anything.  I bust my ass working every day and I still can't get anything right.  It's either pay bills or feed kids.  Can't do both anymore.  Everything is always on my shoulders.   No one helps me carry the load.  So why try anymore. Tired of trying."
537,1,"It feels like everything in my life is going wrong all at once. I feel like I'm being tormented. I feel like the possibility of happiness was dangled in front of my face and when I tried to grab it it got pulled away. I feel like I'll always been miserable and nothing will ever get better, no matter how hard I try.
I've struggled with mental illness all of my life basically, so I never really thought I would be able to be happy. As a teenager I was content with killing myself to avoid the consistent suffering that I was enduring. I never thought I would ever be happy.
After years of treatment after meeting a really good psychiatrist when I was admitted to a hospital I was able to pursue some of my goals. I got a part-time job at my local vet clinic which is amazing. The people there are so friendly and I love being around the animals. I started taking online courses to get the remaining credits I need for my high school diploma and I'm almost finished with them, I just have two more exams to write. I applied to university and got accepted to a really good science program as long as I finish the courses I'm taking with a certain average. I am doing well in the courses and will pass with the average I need so I found an apartment to rent near the school. I planned a time table so I had one evening off a week so I could continue working part time at the vet clinic. Things were going really well and I was excited for September.
There was problems with enrolling in my classes though. For some reason the site won't let me enroll in a mandatory class that is only offered first semester. I've tried reaching out to so many people at the university but no one responded to me emails and I got hung up on when I called. I planned on going down tomorrow to get it sorted out. Almost all the labs for the class I'm enrolled in are full. My schedule is so fucked now that there is no way in hell I'll be able to have an evening off. I will have to quit my job, which is extremely heartbreaking. Working there has given my life meaning when I felt utterly useless. It has helped so much with managing my depression. The last year of working there has been the first time in my life where I've felt like a healthy person. 
I'm completely devastated and feel completely hopeless. I don't want to go to university anymore. It feels like no matter what I do something always goes wrong. I feel so hopeless about the future. I am having really intense suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm and I just dont know what to do. I'm not close to my family so I feel extremely uncomfortable to reach out to them for help. I recently had a falling out with all my friends so I have no one to turn to for support or comfort. My next appointment with my psychiatrist is in the end of August. I just feel so horrible and upset and don't know how I'm going to get past this. It feels like nothing will ever get better because I'm destined to suffer no matter how hard I try at being happy in life. Feeling like my life is falling apart"
538,1,"I haven't been able to sleep this year. It takes me a lot of time to fall asleep, I lay in bed thinking about my problems, wishing I didn't commit certain mistakes, that I took a different decision at some point in life. I always think of ways to solve my problems but not even in fantasy there is a feasible approach. I sleep 2 or 3 hours at most, when I wake up I feel tired and stressed, then when I come to the office I'm randomly falling asleep, sometimes my coworkers wake me up and they say I snore, obviously I don't notice this but my depression has led me to be always stressed and tired, I'm not even able to sleep which is something fundamental. I can't sleep"
539,1,"Hey. My emotional numbness is preventing me from feeling love, compassion, or...*anything at all* toward my boyfriend. This just makes the relationship feel stressful and pointless.

540,1,"I was talking with my therapist earlier.  In retrospect, I’ve made a fair amount of progress. I’ve gotten out from under an abusive relationship, I’m almost done paying off the majority of the debt that said relationship put me through, I’ve made steps to improve my health, I’ve sought and kept help for my depression and anxiety as well as discovering and trying to manage having ADHD. But the one part of my life still lacks, and it hits me on days where I’m not preoccupied with work. Ive yet to make any progress with intra-personal and interpersonal relationships. All my life, I’ve tried to rely on others for keeping me active and finding things to do. For once in my life, I really don’t have that. That makes me sad, depressed, and lonely. There are just so many obstacles in my life to figuring that out, and there are just no simple, easy solutions. I’m trying to hold out patience, but setting long term goals has never been my strong suit. I just feel so alone all the time, and I can’t seem to pull myself out of this rut I seem to be stuck in with that. I’ve made progress, but there’s still so much more progress to make."
541,1,"I work a shit job at a grocery store, have to work crazy hours, graveyard, mid, close, and I just got hired for a corporate job in the company, which I start in two weeks that is way higher pay, M-F, 9-5.

I'm terrified my boss will call my new boss and say something.

The night before I got the job offer I was crying on the phone to a friend with a razor blade in my hand. I thought life finally wanted me to be happy for once with this job offer, but with this bullshit drama, I'm worried life is trying to drag me back down. I won't go back to rehab, I won't go back to the psych ward, they don't work. Ending it is the only option. Suicide is the only option if this doesn't work out."
542,1,"I just realized I enjoy this to tell myself I am nothing there's also a sick satisfaction in confessing my flaws,failures and downplaying any achievsmey perhaps I feel like they can't critiscise me then. I also cannot take a compliment it feels like a betrayal of who I am so I tell myself they're lying to me, there just being kind. It feels good to wallow in self hatred to tell myself I am simply inately bad at life, skills anything and everything. Does anyone find joy in hating yourself?"
543,1,"I don't know where to start. I think it's been like 8 years like that and i can't seem to be happy. Little about myself: I'm a 25 years old guy, i finished my university studies and couldn't find a job for about a year. This is where my depression really kicked off. I have a girlfriend that i really love and shs is now my fiancee. During this year she was very supportive but as you may know when you're in a relationship you have to spend money to go out and all that so I ended up landing a job at a bank at a very basic salary. 2 years after that i decided to quit my job and find anything with more money. No one supported my decision i feel so empty. I keep on smoking occasionally i dont know why. I masturbate and regret it. I cant finish anything i start i always quit. I cant even keep up a week in the gym. I'm now a fat depressed guy with cholesterol. I dont show up my feelings. Anything can hurt me and wish to cry but i hold myself. I really don't know what is holding me together till now. I'm always thinking about what if i die and all will go away? Will people remember me in a nice way? The pressure is too much and i really dont know what to do at this point. I'm depressed of pretty much everything and desperate for help"
544,1,My husband is depressed and it’s hard to watch. I’ve been depressed many times myself but now the roles are reversed. He is refusing to get out of bed or talk to anyone on the phone. He was supposed to go see his psychiatrist today and refused to do that also. It’s very frustrating not being able to help him. Is there a sub for family members?
545,1,"He’s amazing and never makes me feel bad for being depressed. But it hurts him to see me cry. I just want to be happy for him. I think about what would happen if I broke up with him or killed myself but I always come to the conclusion that it would hurt him even more, especially in the long run. I don’t want to make it his problem. He deserves a happy girlfriend. I feel like a burden on my boyfriend."
546,1,"I don't know if it's melancholy, or what. It's like I feel like there's something I'm forgetting to worry about.. this always on edge feeling that I can't pinpoint. I do have a little bit of OCD, and I make a mental list and a list in my phone of the things I need to do. (appts, etc) I've been through alot in a short time span. My sister died last September, got left by my bf/baby daddy of 10 years in November, our landlord kicked us out at the beginning of May, and now everything just seems off track.. I guess the no stability thing is what's throwing me off. :( Any input would be helpful. Thanks for reading.. What is the feeling that I can't describe??"
547,1,"I know this is extremely selfish but I don't want her to be prettier than me. (I've bpd so our friendship is really unstable) My self esteem is so low and being the ""pretty"" friend always prevented me from hitting rock bottom. She has changed so much during the last years and I still look like the same idiot and my behaviours are still childlike. Basically everyone i know is changing and growing up and Im just laying in my bed and can't get up because everything is so exhausting. I don't want to get up anymore, I don't want to go out anymore, I just want to sleep the whole day until I die. Not even my boyfriend is cheering me up he just tells me to loose some weight and I'm sure he's lying every time he's calling me ""beautiful"" Best friend sent me some selfies and I can't stop crying because now she's prettier than me"
548,1,"A year back I quit the job I loved because of some reasons. My life lost track after that, yet again.
Almost 3 years back I got the kind of job I was looking for, work that excites me. It really took depression away from me. In the beginning I loved work, as soon as we expanded we lost old people, got replaced by more people(culture changed). Although i was great at my work, I hated the city I lived in(not a very social city) but I loved the job, but the selfish/gossiping/backbiting culture intimidated me. We built this place and here it was in ruins because of petty politics. I tried to fix it but it did not. So i thought it was best to quit. That was the worst decision i have ever made. I'm messed up after that. I have messed up job interviews. No track. I'm broke. Now I've thought of studying a masters in another field i always wanted to pursue, in another city for a fresh start , and it excites me and i think it's my thing. Now i only worry my nervousness will hurt my interview or tests. I am good at work but i have severe anxiety I am good at presentations but i am bad at interviews, I get nervous when people ask me about me. I don't know what to do. I'm not an extrovert but I love to speak to people i am comfortable with. I think I am fighting this and I'm optimistic that one day it'll all get better"
549,1,"Hello all.

I have dealt with depression for a majority of my life. Up until about a year ago I was resistant to seeking help because meds did not help me when I was a teenager, and in general seeing someone is costly and time consuming. 

A year ago I started on an SSRI, and it really seemed to help me until a month or two ago. My anxiety has stayed under control for the most part, but my depression is coming back pretty bad. I have contacted my doctor, and am now on a 5 month wait list to see a psychiatrist. I am working with my doctor and my work's HR to get approved for FMLA to not get in trouble time off due to doctor's visits. However I am not sure what to do in the meantime. I don't want to exhaust my friends talking about the problems I'm experiencing, and things that are surfacing after I thought I had worked through them in the past.

I think this may be due to me reducing my activity, and also some personal relationship issues. I have tried to start walking more and push myself to be willing to talk about what upsets me, but it doesn't seem to be letting up. I am afraid that if I don't seek help it will just continue to get worse and 5 months seems like forever to wait. I tried finding someone from my insurance by searching 'accepting new clients' but when I did find someone it was the same story (long wait list). 

If anyone has any advice or have been in this situation, please let me know what helped you. I'm afraid my doctor may just want to try a different medication, but that comes with its own issues.. How to find care or take care of myself in the meantime."
550,1,"I graduated undergrad summa cum laude at 22, and I will finish graduate school at 24.  Yet, it all just seems like dust in the wind.  I have 2 years left, and I feel like a shell of the man I was at 18.  I take 2 antidepressants and blood pressure medicine, none of which I took when I first started college, and my bloodwork is absolutely horrible.  

&amp;#x200B;

 It seems like nothing will make me happy anymore.  I love music, and I play guitar 1-2 hours a day, and I feel good for a little bit, then it's right back to my dissatisfied state.  I work extremely hard in school, but I don't even enjoy the academic success that I've had. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I did not even post the graduation pictures.  Not a single one of them.  I look at the man staring back at me in those pictures, and I don't like him.  I don't know who he is anymore.  I was me, but now he's gone. Young and successful, but utterly miserable to the core"
551,1,"When you sink back into that low place, when all the built up negative shit just spews out is the worst. You say depressing shit you instantly regret. That feeling of helplessness, that your in the never ending rotation of being decent or feeling like absolute shit. I’m so tired of this, the worst part is it never gets better or if it does it barely lasts and I’m back to feeling like shit. Up down, up down, like a fucking rollercoaster LMAO. The worst feeling of all"
552,1,"I’ve been suicidal for a long time, but it’s gotten a lot worse and I think I’d benefit from seeking out help. I am planning on telling a teacher I am very close with, as my school doesn’t have a counsellor and I’m not close enough with my parents to want to come to them first. My close friend has also talked to this teacher and he hasn’t told her parents and he’s apparently been very helpful, so that gives me assurance that he’d be the right person for me to tell. But the problem is, I’m very anxious and awkward. I know it’d be best for me to initially tell him face-to-face, but I don’t think I’d be able to do it. Should I try anyways, or should I email him/give him a letter? I’d be much more comfortable with this, but there’d also be solidified evidence of my feelings, and that also makes me anxious. Plus, our school board tracks emails I believe.

Moreover, what should I say or write? There isn’t a big reason behind my suicidal thoughts, it’s mostly self-loathing and utter hopelessness. Does anyone have any advice?

If someone could help me draft something so I don’t have to do it alone, that’d be nice. That way, even if I did do it face-to-face, I’d know exactly what I want to say. 

Thanks in advance! Does anyone have advice for telling a trusted adult about my suicidal thoughts?"
553,1,"Okay so first I'm identified as a trans male to female but I can't transition and I'm very secretive about it so I'm hating everything about being a male I'm pretty much ugly and my face has imperfections and skin is ruined by pimples and has permanent scars and my posture is bad from gaming from youth and body isn't that beautiful to the point I only feel comfortable when I'm laying on my bed.

I have anxiety since I was a kid , strong depression the latest 3-4 years , dysphoria and really low self esteem since forever , I don't wear shirts or shorts or these stuff because of the imperfection across whole body.

I got depression treatment before but couldn't continue because of money factor and I got rid of suicidal thoughts for a good period of time but now they're back and they're Strong.

I just hate myself and my life I just want to end it but I'm too coward to do it besides my family needs me and I can't leave them with this selfish act like this but I really can't keep going like this.

Whenever I see a beautiful girl I just feel depressed, anxious, dysphoric and jealous of here and her luck of being a female and I just feel worthless around them literally worthless. 

I just can't take it anymore I can't commit to anything in life and I hate my engineering Major that I'm going and I discovered I can't be an engineer with this mentally so I won't have a job and life will be hell.

I don't know maybe I'm not qualified to live in this world maybe I didn't win the genetic lottery with bad looks and bad mentality.

554,1,"High school has ended and I want to fucking kill myself. Throughout my life I was always bullied and never had any friends until high school. I decided I wasn’t going to get pushed around anymore and decided to stand up for myself. I built a business that makes me 60k a year in passive income and went from a skinny lanky tall kid to a tall muscular man. I feel good about my accomplishments however last summer I had this girl who was interested in me and was wanting to date me from what I heard. I was to focused on my business and wasn’t that attracted to her. I think apart of that was she was dating a new guy every month as well and I didn’t just want to be another guy. (She didn’t do it for sex just emotional reasons) I feel like only someone crazy would think that because she actually is very pretty and out of my league. Anyways I always thought that by senior year that I would attract females due to my money and muscle however by the time I had all of this it was the end of the school year and high school was over. I realized towards the end I should have dated the girl who liked me and that would have made my senior year great. I could have taken her to prom, homecoming and all the games and had a great relationship. Sadly I had to watch her spend it with someone else and it is all my fault. I feel sick to my stomach and just want to turn back time and get those moments I never had. But I can’t. It’s over. People have told me just look into the future but I can’t. I feel like I failed and I can’t mentally accept this. I either want to find a way to have a romantic relationship like the one I had dreamed of or kill myself. I see literally no other purpose and I don’t want to enjoy my life or move on until I somehow make up for the time I have lost. I am not excited about life and want death to take me. Most of you in the comments will probably call me crazy and I definitely feel mentally insane. I just need to somehow fix this or end it. Help I am mentally insane and want to kill myself"

560,1,"I'm 16F, and nothing I do feels ""real"". Everytime I do something, I don't feel like I'm in the moment at all. My mind always thinks, ""in ten minutes you won't be here"", and then it seems like 10 minutes comes too early and I'm wishing I could go back to 10 minutes before. Nothing feels real to me. Time doesn't feel real. Memories from a year ago and memories from an hour ago feel just as old as each other. 

Maybe that's just a disorder. But another thing I feel is just...nothing. Sometimes I just get this really weird emotion that I've been thinking of as just feeling ""gray"". It's not that I don't care about anything, it's that I feel, like, no emotions.  I don't feel tired, but I don't feel energetic. It feels like I'm moving through syrup sometimes, and other times it's like my mind just isn't in the right place at the right time. Feeling gray for me can last from a couple minutes to at most an hour, a couple hours if I'm on my computer or watching TV or something. The first time I felt gray was during an orchestra practice at school, and I went into this zone where I didn't even feel the strain or weight of the violin or the tiredness of my hands. I liked feeling gray then, because I didn't feel tired. But now I don't like it. It's summer, and I'm supposed to be happy and energetic, but it doesn't even feel like summer, just a weekend that keeps going on. I know that soon enough I'm going to wake up in September and think about this, and I don't like it.

I want to live in the moment. I want to stop thinking about the future. I don't like this.

Is this depression? Is this a disorder?

I do get help for it, but it’s still there... I’ve just learned how to manage it. I can’t really talk about it to anyone or vent outside of certain places (such as this forum and my professional treatment team. At least my parents are supportive, too. But I can’t tell other people).

I also know there are some people with depression who are creative and can write amazing stories, paint amazing paintings, write great songs, etc. But I don’t have that. 

Are there any benefits to having this condition? A silver lining?

And there’s nothing wrong with being religious, but I’m not religious myself, so please don’t say anything such as God gave it to me for a reason.

562,1,"""everyone is different"" ""all the best people are crazy"" ""being the lone wolf is so cool""

No it's fucking not. Those who say these don't know what it feels like to be excluded from everything, to be alienated, discriminated. They don't know what it's like to live without human connection, when everyone avoids you because you're different from them.

No, it's not good when you're standing out from the crowd. It's a nightmare. You don't belong anywhere. You're not just alone, you are lonely, and the two is not the same at all.

I've been trying to get some therapy sorted but its taking so long and I'm really panicking about how my mental health is going to affect my work.

 Every day I'm just filled with this continuous suffocating anxiety and I'm so close to tears all the time. I'm not sleeping properly, I can't think and I'm getting headaches all the time. 

I've been doing everything your supposed to be doing to look after yourself and your well-being (gym etc) but nothing is making this suffocating dullness go away. 

Getting so pissed off with everything and I've already cried at work twice in the last month...

I had to go to the office to get something and the teacher went through my note book and saw the note. So she called down to the office while we was down there and the counselor and the principal called my grandparents (who I live with) and told them they freaked out and came to the school. An officer had to come in and shit. After the officer I left with my grandma who was going to the bar and about 40 minutes after we got there CPS called and said I had to get evaluated.

575,1,"I’ll try keep it brief.

My history is I’m currently on a health benefit for ongoing depression, anxiety and another reason.

I’ve very slowly been getting better for the past couple of months or so. But since yesterday my mood has started going downhill but only a little. I’ve also been concerned that it would be all too good to be true and that everything would just go bad again.

I keep fighting to improve myself, trying to get my life in order so I can work again, deal with bullying issues in the past. 

Anyway, introduction aside,

I’ve just been hit by what feels like a massive wave of depression. I’ve never ever experienced something like this. I mean usually it’s a build up.

This is just intense. I’ve been in tears. Normally I just go downhill because of thought patterns. I’m also a bit shaky, I developed a headache. My depression thoughts went into overdrive. When it hit me I just wanted to throw up. It’s stopped being as intense now but it’s tired me.  It just hit me but I did have some kind of little panic attack a couple of days back. But that had a trigger, this didn’t. It just randomly came on and doesn’t feel like my panic attacks. 

My normal depression goes up and down in waves. It’s been a long struggle. I just don’t want it to get worse again.  

Please no discussion about medication. I’ve always reacted badly to antidepressants and I’ve tried all sorts. I am currently receiving therapy, have been to counseling and I use CBT. 

I’ve had depression for years but this is the first time this happened with no prompting (I was seriously ill and nearly 5 years back and was on a lot of meds at a time).

Edit: It’s been a while. Not shakey now. But just feel like shit. I’ve always felt like there’s something wrong and bad about me. 

Come to think of it, could this have been a panic attack? Just been hit by an intense and sudden wave of depression or something."

I can't believe my teacher even believed in me. It sucks that I disappoint him. Wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone heh.
I want to cry but I can't. Even my own brain knows that I'm just being petty. I'm aware that everything I say now is probably an over exaggeration but is it really? Is it worth placing your time and effort into a person who's just prone to giving up? 
This is probably a sad read. But there's no point in  sympathising with someone so miserable and useless. I probably sound like some pretentious prick looking for attention. Some idiot who thinks he's got it worse than anyone else.

579,1,"Hello,

my depressed girlfriend of 1 year yesterday broke up with me, because she feels sad about our relationship and like a burden to me. I accepted her decision and stayed calm during our last talk. She cryed a lot, hugged me tight and said she never wanted to lose me. During our last weeks before the breakup, she explained that she needed space and found it unfair that she couldnt support me as much as i supported her.

In the bag with the belongings i took with me was a heavily perfumed letter, in which she wrote that she feels terribly sorry for this decision, that she will always love me and that i am the best person she’s ever had in her life.

I enjoy beeing with her, she is in the ending phase of youth therapy and even her therapist told her once that i am supporting her the right way. We never had trust issues, but she is afraid of the future and doesnt want to hurt me.

No feelings of happiness, sadness, excitement -nothing. I have no money, no motivation to work, no time to do things that I used to love doing because I am in this small boat and the only thing that I am doing is paddling. I feel like the paddle is slowly wearing off, and eventually I’d have to use my hands until I have no energy left. 

I used to write, keep diaries, have a beautiful body, I had friends, my family was together, broken apart but at least they were all in the same house. I used to go  therapy, I felt like things were going to be okay, always. I had so much hope, so much passion, so much going on in my head. Times were rough but at least I had a routine; I was productive. I did something. Now? I do nothing all day. I had a little hope left thinking I could make it into university with nothing - how delusional of me. 

I’ve gained a lot of weight due to taking antidepressants as well as bingeing. I’ve always had a shit relationship with food. I stay at my boyfriends house for weeks on end because I try so hard to avoid my old home.

I’m 18; I just want to be comfortable, I want to have an OK job, I want my boyfriend to be happier, I can’t even make myself talk about my feelings in real life because I’m just so used to bottling it up or expressing it violently. I don’t know anything, I’ve only got 7 A*-C GCSES and no other academic qualifications, I work at places for like 2 months and quit. Never had any good relationships with anyone at work because of the way that I am. I wish i could tell you that i’m just some sad pretty white girl but absolutely not. I’m a fucking monster, even after having a fucjing rhinoplasty at 16. I had a deviated septum because my dad punched the shit out of my face when i was a kid and I couldnt look at people from the right side of my face or even look that direction because of how disgusting my nose looked. 

All I do is just lie in bed and watch bestgore. Maybe go on instagram here and there, play some overwatch, i dont enjoy any of this, this has just become part of my routine. I don’t even brush my teeth anymore; haven’t done so for at least 3 months. I have never brushed my teeth daily because that was just something I wasn’t taught.

590,1,"hello, i am *brand new* here. i am not sure if this has been discussed extensively, or at all even - surely it has. i am not sure if there's a better place for this post, so please bear with me.  


some brief, basic info on me: 

&amp;#x200B;

since i can remember, i have had anger issues. luckily, my parents both in their own ways have helped me to deal with anger in relation to violence, as i was definitely prone to be violent, growing up. i've learned many effective techniques to deal with my anger, in general, but that doesn't address the root of the anger. while i can have a bit of a temper, my probelm is mostly pent up pissed-offedness (however, my road rage is unreasonable). i have anxiety, and have panic-attacks from time to time, as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

all of this to say:

my wife has always dealt with depression, and i've learned a lot from her over the past 12 years. but, i've never personally experienced the symptoms or signs of depression that we commonly hear about. for the some time now i've wondered if maybe depression is just manifested as anger in my life, so i am here to see if anyone can speak to their experience(s) in this regard.  


please forgive any ignorance on my part if this is not the type of post this sub typically accommodates. depression manifested as anger?"

593,1,"I did bad things to many people. I'm just talking about being manipulative. I find that I've moved on, opened myself, seen what I've done wrong, but it's destroying everything with my wife.

Quite honestly, it's making me want to end myself, but Im not going to do that in a million years. I just wish I could escape myself, if we truly get one life. This is what I've done with it. I can't escape a past that keeps haunting me"
594,1,"When you have depression and anxiety people just assume you are lazy and to blame for your issues. When you don't go out because you are to stressed about life and your self image, people just assume you don't want to go out. When you want to spend 1 on 1 time with a friend, they assume you don't like their friends and are anti social. When you don't work for a month because you can barely wake up in the morning or sleep at night, people think you are lazy.

I'm tired of being the person that people don't like and that makes people uncomfortable because of a mental illness that distorts the way you think and the way you think people think of you. I'm tired of the pain I feel in the morning. I'm tried of judgment people place on me for something I can't control. People just assume you are the problem and it hurts"

Eyes drooping with a tiredness that’ll not end anytime soon. A heart that is sore and calloused, every “i love you” wasted, in hopes of one in return. 

There is no hope - I think I met a Hope once - there is none. Like the sun that’ll rise and warm the skin, the hopelessness subsides to the feeling of a full tummy. Dusk and all of it scavenges like a hyena to devour happiness

I just want to reach out to someone but everyone is busy now and I don’t want to worry them or just be told “just go” or “just take the medicine. I’m not really sure what I’m going to do.

I’m now 22 and if it wasn’t for how much I’d hurt my family and girlfriend I’d do it. There’s so much to unpack I don’t even know where to start. Don’t even know if I should post in an addiction sub since I feel like it’s so intertwined with my depression.

When I was little I was a fat kid and probably had a addictive relationship with food, I do now. Through a lot of use and bad decisions I feel like I’ve completely destroyed my worldview and feel hopeless as to ever be happy. I’ve OD’d twice, not on purpose, but it hurts to know how easy it would be.

I feel like I’ve been poisoned by reading shit like Kaczynski yet simultaneously can’t let go of these ideas. I just can’t bring myself to put energy into anything besides being a high and mighty misanthrope. I know it’s really unhealthy for me but I obsess over news and politics and feel like I’m just watching a puppet show that runs on repeat with a shrinking cycle. I most of the time feel like I’m being gaslit. I’m a huge loser but think of myself as higher than most others.

I have no family and friends that are on my side. I am alone and always will be and so people should stop persuading me in any way to be alive because I dont want to, there's so many out there in the world who are doing great and are positive and I'm just not. I will never be happy, always angry and unsatisfied and depressed. I feel like I'm forced to live only because of my relatives and society standards. Thoughts are taking over me like a knife and I feel like I have a problem with people, not only myself. I have too much anxiety and depression and therefore hide it so not everyone knows. I wish someone would kill me and leave me to die so I wouldn't have take my own life so they dont point out that I'm guilty.  Seriously am frustrated and sad in being in this world and I want everyone to leave me alone, nothing matters anymore because I'll never be enough for anyone or anything and no one will miss me when I'm gone. I'm sure of it, I dont want to wake up in this cruel world and having dark negative thoughts about how ""I'm not trying hard enough on things"", ""that I can't do certain things because of my anxiety"" ""that I am weak"" and that ""I always fail"" and that ""nobody will ever me like me because of the way I am"". I'm sick and tired of crying and pretending that I am okay, and have people take advantage of me IRL just for their benefit because I'm weak. Being strong takes too much and energy and I just wish everything would stop, as I said I'm ""worthless"" also unwanted and a girl that can't do anything right and I am ungrateful for being in this life. I hate waking up being who I am not being able to feel better not attending to my issues being joke in this world that is always ignored and not taken seriously. I wish God could take me now.

600,1,"Hello,

Ive been going through a very rough time in life these past few years, the past few months have been extremely hard to the point of intrusive suicidal thoughts and terrible, terrible anxiety, as well as self loathing. I am entering my senior year of college this fall and wanted to get my life on the right track and have started intensive outpatient therapy and celexa 10mg. I’ve been reading people’s experiences on the drug and I’m so worried because of so many people complaining about it! Is it really that bad!? I only plan on taking it for maybe a year to get all my shit together before I graduate so I can get a decent job and strengthen relationships as well as network effectively. Is this the right route or should I stay drug free? Just took my first Celexa pill"
601,1,"I've noticed the only reason why I bother to stay alive is so I can play video games and do drugs or drink, it seems to be the only thing that keeps me going and it seems like they're better than reality, I seemingly have never lived for myself and only for others because I've always hated myself, I don't kill myself just so I don't make my mom or my younger brother sad, and without them I would willingly go and blow my brains out. Is that bad? Real life just seems way too shitty, and the only thing that keeps me going are virtual worlds where I'm actually meaningful. I can't stand being around people and I have no desire to go out and find love or make new friends anymore. I spend all day at home by myself doing drugs and playing games and I'm very poor 99 percent of the time since I don't have any income besides selling things online, I don't have a job.

602,1,"Hey all,

Hope y’all don’t mind if I complain a bit. I’ve been on this subreddit for a bit and I know I’m very lucky compared to a lot of people. I’ve never felt like I want to hurt myself and I’m at no risk of suicide. That being said, it’s still hard to get through the day.

I’m constantly scared in my house. My parents have a lot of expectations for me to get better, and when I I don’t hit those goals they want me to explain my thinking. I’m constantly exhausted and I’m finding it harder and harder to function every day. Every second is ruled by fear and if I thought I could get away with it I’d drink a bottle of alcohol every day. At least if I’m drunk I’ll feel good. So yeah, not sure what I’m expecting. Guess I’m just like the rest of you all. Fuck. First time posting"

604,1,"This is my story, of how I went from one of the most optimistic, bright, smiling kids of my school to needing anti depressants. Please, share yours in the comments aswell if you feel like it helps, I want to try and make people feel better.

So, I skipped a grade. Preschool to be exact, not that important. I go to kindergarten. The first few weeks, I make possibly one of the worst mistakes of my life. I call this kid an idiot, for putting scissors in the glue box. Sounds small, right? No. All but small. For the next 8 years of my life, I would get hit, belittled down, get my lunch stolen, aswell as have almost all my friends leave. I only had one friend through this terrible time, and he barely kept me from hurting myself. I'm currently in 8th grade now, and I still occasionally think of ending it all. So, Ivan, if your reading this, are you proud of what you've done? My depression story, share yours too."

606,1,"I’m really lost.  I’m a former first responder and after leaving that job due to a medical injury, I landed a job that kept me on the road for 200+ nights a year.  I did it for 4.5 years and recently left that job to be “retired”.  That job just wasn’t healthy.

A girl that I met while on the road, whom I thought had a future with, recently told me she had been seeing someone (she thought I wasn’t in to her) and she is now pregnant.  The father is in the picture, unplanned pregnancy, but they’re making it work.

Then, I get a text from her that her father just passed away, and I wanted nothing more than to be there with her and for her, but I know that isn’t appropriate.

I’ve tried calling up psychiatrists and, despite having insurance, either no one calls me back or aren’t taking new patients. 

I don’t have the energy I used to.  I know I suffer from PTSD things from horrific scenes, and also unresolved issues with anxiety and depression.

I have the material things, I just don’t have that zest for life which scares the crap out of me.  I seem to be attracting the broken ones - the ones that need fixing and I do so much to help them and then end up breaking myself in the meantime.

I’ve been lying in bed for hours on end.  Sometimes I listen to music, sometimes the silence.  I put on a great front and when I meet people they see who I want them to see - someone that has their crap together.  But, in reality, I’m a mess of emotions.

I know I should probably be medicated (I was after my mom passed for a brief while) and that scares me too but since I haven’t had any mental health professionals call back with any positive news, I feel like my downward spiral is just continuing. 

I’m tired of hurting.  So so tired.  I just don’t know how much more I can handle. What’s wrong with me?"
607,1,"i had depression really early on in my life. it started in about fourth grade, when i had to move. i know elementary school isnt hard but i was a stellar student who never got into trouble until i moved. my grades started slipping and my parents were relentless about yelling at me for it. i stopped brushing my teeth and my hair. i had to have huge knots cut out of my hair multiple times. i wouldnt shower. i didnt care to. my room was constantly messy. like really messy. nothing seemed to matter. it stayed that way until halfway through my freshman year in highschool. 

that was because i met a girl. she wasnt good for me at all. but she made me realize that i was bi and i have a huge emotional attachment to her now. she hit me, forced me to do drugs or else she would break up with me, she cheated on me twice, and constantly manipulated and lied to me. but there was something about her that made me wanna start caring about myself. for the year and a half that we dated, i took care of myself. i brushed my teeth and took showers and worked out. i went back to the student i was before it all started, i made all A’s. i cleaned my room and kept it clean.  i had actual plans for the future instead of accepting that i would be dead by the end of high school. i did more things that i wanted to do. my parents started to become more at ease with me. 

then, she broke up with me. because i was upset at her for cheating on me. she started dating my ex best friend. and for about nine months after, i was okay. i was sad that i didnt have her because i love her so much but i was okay. i still took care of myself. i forced myself to eat even though my body would reject anything i tried to eat for a while. i worked out. i did my schoolwork. (remained a 4.0/4.0 gpa). i kept working towards my dreams. all of my friends told me that this was the best that theyve ever seen me. i kissed who i wanted to and went to parties purely to dance. i got sober, completely :). i got my license.  my room stayed perfectly clean. life was so good. 

but now, ten months later, im sitting in my room. like i have been for the past week. ive been sleeping all day and staying up all night to watch youtube (minecraft videos lol bc thats what i used to watch whenever i got sad when i was young or whenever my parents were fighting). my parents yell at me for being lazy. i started to clean out my closet but i gave up halfway through and now my room is messy again. i have old plates and bowls up here. i dont remember the last time i brushed my teeth or washed my hair. and i keep torturing myself by thinking about her and thinking about how it would be if she would take me back. (i texted her probably once every three months to tell her i still love her, just in case).  im also now finding it really hard to take care of my fish and my cat. my fishes’ tanks are disgusting. i cant bring myself to clean them. my cat has to literally scream at me to get me out of bed so i can feed her. i feel so bad about it. because i love my cat more than anything and she deserves better. but i can hardly take care of myself anymore. 

it feels like old times. and ive resorted back to sucking my fingers. (i had ptsd when i was little about my parents fighting so i sucked my fingers until i was 13. im 18 now and im doing it again.) i feel pitiful. i also got in a wreck bc my brakes failed and i have tendinitis in both of my quads. i cant bring myself to go to physical therapy or do any of the exercises at home. i dont know what to do anymore. i feel like my old self. i feel empty. i dont know how it got so bad after it was good for almost 2.5 years. im falling back into old habits."
608,1,"So, I hit rock bottom real hard this past few months starting from last year actually 🤔 . It was such a blur period where everything was in a foggy state. Constant feeling of lost, unwanted, disgusted, hopeless, despair like I lost something in me. No perfect word can be described what people actually feel during that state of time.Because, honestly, you feel nothing. Like you’re drowning but you’re not.

Moving on, I no longer not care what is going on around me which means things are progressing right? 
I dropped out of Uni this year, that’s when I hit the bottom of rock bottom. My family don’t understand what really is going on and i have no means of telling them as well. I grew to realised that they are not as opened or accustomed to such topic from frequent conversations that touch the subject. 

So, right now, after many months had passed since the day I quit Uni, I have made up my mind that I’m finally ready to start all over again. TBH, I don’t even know how to write out all of the jumbled messy thoughts in my mind. So here it is:
 
My family told me that it’s better that I don’t  continue my degree and help out my brother on his F&amp;B retail business because start-up business is really fragile and need a lot of monitoring and support. Before that , they told me to just made up my mind to go to study any course I wanted , they reassure me on that. Now, they tell me straight in the face that it’s better that I don’t continue my study so that they can use the money or save up the money to invest in the business. I’m confused? Do I even matter?

I spent months and months trying to figure what I want after what you told me before, and now they twist it around? When I confront them about this, they’ll always say ‘things change in life, not everything  will go according to plans’ .

Can any Senpais weighs in on this? Really lost (again) right now . I need opinions on this matter 🙏🏻"
609,1,"I'm 20 f. Still living with parents and finishing up college for my visual arts degree. I have extremely bad anxiety when it comes to learning how to drive or having a job. My first two job experiences were not very good, I've had crappy managers that hated me and a job that while to others isn't that physically taxing, it was to me. Having to send at a register for 8 hours while also having to run back and forth stocking physically made me sick. And with driving in just terrified. Just the thought of being on the road almost takes me to tears. I just feel that my life has no meaning at this point. I'm never going to contribute anything worthwhile to society and I feel I'd better off being dead and not having to suffer. I'm just so scared. So scared. Being dead just feels like less effort. I feel like nothing matters."
610,1,"Thinking about doing a piece on how depressed people affect the immediate environment around them. I have certainly built many of what I call ""depression palaces"" (apartments of filth and apathy, entire rooms I cannot traverse due to random clutter, vehicles crammed with unfulfilled hobbies, the bottle mountains). These spaces are not willed into existence or engineered, but rather a natural biproduct of the lack of will and conscious thought, which fascinates me to no end. I think they are a physical imprint of the depressed mind, almost like a vinyl record of our feelings and suffering.

I am interested in your spaces of depression and what they're like, and I do not judge. Candy wrappers and dirty underwear - I don't care. I wanna hear it all. What does depression do to the spaces around you? What are your Depression Palaces?"
611,1,"I have been in a relationship, with 2, for as long as I can remember. Dee &amp; Ana. It's love-hate. They aren't nice to me, but they're the most familiarity I have. They like to talk over me all of the time and take control of my life. I have to fight just to get my own thoughts out and speak up, though they're great at having me confuse their thoughts and feelings for mine. Sometimes, I sit back and watch them fight each other. Dee is the reason I feel like I'm not of much worth or allowed hope. She is my depression. Ana is the reason I have so many walls keeping everyone else out and keeps me from accepting any type of love. She is my anxiety. Every trauma I have ever had in life gives them validity. I'm still here. I'm still fighting. I'm mentally and emotionally spent a lot of the time, but I wouldn't trade the good moments I had in the driver's seat. It’s still hard."

613,1,"I feel like I have everything but nothing at the same time, its 4am, I've barely been sleeping for a very long time, I want to just cry all the damn time but I can't, I was raised to always protect my younger siblings, I was raised with the inability to emotionally connect with another person. For the past 3 years I didn't understand why I was feeling so may things that I couldn't understand, I hate me, I felt like I was useless, I found it hard for myself to believe that those who loved me. I get more and more anxious with expressing how I feel, I want to be able to tell someone how I've been feeling for a very long time BUT wish to be alone at the same time. Maybe it's not depression, maybe it is, I don't know, I'm scared, I want to cry. 

I've seen so much happen I'm my life, I knew I wasn't mentally stable as I'd used to be, I knew I was on a decline, I knew it bit I didn't know anything at the same time. I can't find motivation to do anything, I feel ugly, I don't know why posting on reddit is the most logical choice for me, I didn't have the guts to press the call button for a hotline today, instead I decided to focus on my work. 

Please don't judge me, I'm very confused and out of touch with how I'm feeling and how I should feel. I feel selfish for having all these kinds of feelings, I've been drowning myself in my work, I've delt with my pain alone, I'm young so when I open up I get the ""you're too young for this"" speech, maybe I am but I still feel so alone, I'm scared, I just want to bawl my eyes out. When I feel like I'm ready to be happy, there's always something in the way.

Currently I feel like a soda can ready to burst at any point, just want to let out everything that has happened to me in the past, all my anger, sadness, loneliness, mourning. 

Um, I dressed up for the first time in a long time, I wore something nice and did my makeup. That person I'm the mirror didn't look like me at all, I felt unsafe but it's a bonus that I went outside today.

If someone has some advice to handle myself better please let me know. Today was the day I decided to take initiative and ask for help, instead of shrugging it off.

Can I be able to experience the feeling of being normal again? I don't know how I should deal with myself"
614,1,"I have a learning disability and suffer from mental health disorders. Right now the anxiety and depression are unbearable. I had a job interview and think I choked. My malfunctioning brain froze and I don’t have the stability to deal with the inevitable rejection. I’m just trying to do better and succeed. I’m really trying. My brain just doesn’t work, it has a big hole and tiny little holes where information slips out. All I want is to make a proper living and be a contributing member of society. I don’t want much. I wish I was normal. If I could have one wish it would just to be normal with a normal brain 🧠 😰 I Messed It Up"
615,1,"Idrk if this belongs here but idk where else to put it so yeah. No matter how many times ive been emotionally and mentally put down by certain people, I still feel an obligation towards them and no matter what the situation, I will always love them and put them completely before me Hopeless"
616,1,So excited to be entirely unproductive for 2-3 working days Watched a film that triggered a depressive episode
617,1,"  I'm sorry for my english and syntax, I'm not from England, america, etc. 
  First of all, I created new account so my past lover can't read this. You will soon know why.
  I've been in love with one girl, she is from another country, 7 hours by train away, I know her for 3 years now, I really tried to make her love me, but she loved another man, and she got in relationship with him. After a year of us two chatting I quit and told her to get away from my life. Next year was the worst year of my life, a year of remorse, a year of insane depression. On january 2019, she texted me, said she is sorry and that she was thinking about me all the time. She told me her relationship with him was torture and abusive, he told her she is bitch etc. I helped her to get out of it, she got out and started to call with  me. But her mom is thinking she is bitch 'cause as soon as she left him, she started to call with me and wanted to meet me next month. She said I was helping her through her depression for those 3 years and I was kind to her all the time, even tho it had to be hard for me. We were flirting for a month now.
 ...
  Last week her ex was with her to grab his things and get out. I told her I am worried that she will come back to him, she told me ""don't worry, nothing will happen, never.""
  Guess what happened, last sunday she wrote ""I want to give him another chance, last one, I don't want my mom to hate me, sorry."" 
I'm destroyed, I can't think straight, I hate her, I told her to fuck off and go fuck yourself.
  You feel me? 3 years of me trying and being honestly kind to her and when she starts to love me, she comes back to her abusive ex who doesn't allow her to have friends.
  Yesterday, 1. July 2019, I decided to kill myself, she was the only thing holding my mind. I bought sleeping pills and ate like 20 pills on a shot of vodka. I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye to her. I wrote to her ""If you want to say something before I pass out, do it now"" 
  She freaked out and started to tell me not to do it, that I have something to life for, I didn't care. She told me she is calling my sister, I didnt want my family to know I have suicidal thoughts so I told her I'll throw up those pills, I did. She saved me this time, but I want to try it again today or tomorrow. 
  Should I help her again or should I leave her be? I mean she came back to him so her mom won't call her bitch every time she comes home.

Edit: I'm 17, she is 17 too I tried to kill myself yesterday"
618,1,"No matter how much I talk about my problems, both in real life or the internet, no one ever says to me ""good luck"" or ""I hope things get better"". 

&amp;#x200B;

So I might as well ask outright...

&amp;#x200B;

It probably won't improve my fortunes. Still, I'd appreciate it. Will someone wish me luck?"
619,1,"I’m constantly tired and my head fucking hurts every day and my muscles ache, my lower back hurts, my neck, hurts my shoulders. god I’m so done with this, I’m really getting bored of it, I have suck terrible coping mechanisms too I really should be quick about it and off myself Constant pain"
620,1,"The last few weeks I have been hitting a hard depression and so many things have statues falling apart for me. I called my mom sobbing yesterday because my laptop got stolen out of my unlocked car with my resume’ and flash drive in there and a bunch of my cover letters. I set aside this week to job hunt and the day was already starting off as an uphill battle. 

I braved myself for her response before she even gave it but it still stung. “Well, why didn’t you lock your door?” To be fair, this is valid but it’s not like I intentionally left it locked. In fact, me neighborhood had been a mess lately so I’ve been extra intentional. Then I forgot my wallet after riding my bike 6 miles to. Coffee shop. And TODAY I forgot my damn Bridesmaid’s dress when my whole point in leaving the house was to go bring it to get hemmed. I mean I’m obviously not trying. Nobody in their right mind would drive 30 minutes just to turn around. But I’m in a really bad spot and I need my brain so badly right now. Sigh. Depression makes it hard to think and organize"
621,1,"Also, wtf is wrong with me? why cant I stop caring about my ex? Can I just get a meaningful hug from my fellow redditors, the last couple years have been rough 😞"
622,1,"Isn't it weird how one small thought can start a whole change of mood?

All it took this morning was one ""It's sad that we don't talk like we used to."" thought, and my whole mood has spiraled down. Now I can't get it out of my head. I know people are busy, but it went from nonstop, everyday, to barely speaking. Even when we do talk it's superfluous and lacking substance.

Soon will come the paranoia that they don't actually want.me around anymore, that I'm just burden on them and it would be better to let them go. But letting someone go who was such a major part of your life is tough...really tough. 

I dunno. Just some rambling. One drop can start a waterfall"
623,1,"I don’t know why I’m venting here, I guess I won’t get much replies anyway but I just need everything out. I’m 24, I have a daughter plus I’m 7 and half months pregnant with another baby. I’m thinking of committing suicide and been restlessly searching for what overdose would give me a cardio-respiratory failure. I want out. I love my daughter to bits but I’m useless to her and my whole life is a failure. I’ve been thinking about death since I was as little as 6 years old. I guess I had some traumas during my childhood I can’t remember, besides the ones I can tell. My mom was (still somewhat is) an anorexic/bulimic and her constantly throwing up even in front of me left me with bad emetophobia and anxiety plus she was very nervous -probably due to nutrient deficit in her system- and hit me constantly, I remember sometimes she would pull my hair so strong it hurt for days, or she would drag me around the house by my ponytail and it was hell. My dad was often away for work and when he was at home he was abusive toward my mom and me too, for example one day I was like 11-12 and went out with a friend, it was summer and we were wearing a mini skirt, when I got home he started calling me a slut, kicked me until I was on the kitchen floor lying and kept kicking while my mom was washing dishes. He never had/has a good word for me. My character is somewhat bad, sometimes I’m hypercritical and aggressive , I don’t want to blame others for my behavior but I guess I never received love so I don’t know how to give it. I had dreams and ambitions, like acting and stuff and all my relatives always made fun of me still thinking I’m psycho. I was bullied since the first day of elementary school, I have olive skin and facial/body hairs and was called with male names/ made fun of so I hated school too and had very few friends. Sometimes classmates would ask to sit near them and an hour later be like “I was drunk (?) I don’t want you near me”. I’ve always been the spare wheel, the third choice not even the second one. Same for middle school, bullied, treated like crap, I had to hid under teachers desk during breaks to prevent bullies finding me, one day during an event in the school yard a class mate pulled my pants down, when I told my parents they laughed. I was traumatized. I could go on and on for days. In high school I started changing my appearance by wearing colored contacts, dying my hair blond etc and that only attracted the wrong people. I was promiscuous, dated much older guys, got a boob job at 15, pregnant at 17 and had a late term abortion cause the baby’s father left me and told me he won’t ever date a girl who already had a child (his own! Mind you). He was abusive, hitting me, spitting in my face and so on, but so was every guy I had relationships with. From high school psychology classes I think I can tell I chose guys resembling my father. At 18 I was working in clubs, got nose jobs, met a new guy and pregnant again by 20. I miscarried and the guy left me blaming me. I suffered but was back in the game shorty after, worked in night clubs (or basically as an escort), changed my appearance completely with surgeries and fillers, moved far from home, had money, lots of it, friends , was out everyday and night and it was for the first time in my life, for the first time I had everything, I was appreciated, I was not alone all the time, I was one of the top girls in clubs, everyone wanted me in their club and had lots of clients. Had my own home near city center and could do whatever. Until I met a guy, a guy who seemed genuinely interested in me and not only for sex, my craving for love came back. But he was a mess, he did cocaine, used my money, made my boss fire me from work, dated other girls. I was so in love it was too late to walk away, I tried cocaine despite being against drugs, just to demonstrated he could be with me, I worked less and less, I tried so hard to be loved by him, until I succeeded. I moved in with him at his parents place, we had plans. We returned together in my hometown at my parent’s so he could find a real job and detoxicate from drugs. He was violent, one time he even stabbed me with a knife in my shoulder, scar is horrid, but I loved him. He stopped drugs, found a job, got me pregnant. When our daughter was 7 days old we visited his hometown and he disappeared for a day and night, coming back all stoned from coke. I forgave him once again. He found a new high paying job, we stayed in with my parents, sometimes fighting, he even hit our baby by mistake when she was 2 months old, leaving her with a scar. But life goes on, I had a major uterine surgery due to hemorrhages, thought I was infertile and had no more period but then got pregnant again. He was happy. I suffered, and still do. He is out working all the time, I’m at home, he doesn’t care about me anymore, everyone in the house treats me like I’m shit. I can’t seem to keep friends anymore, im nice to people but they walk away so I’m alone all the time. My father almost hit me yesterday cause my mom told him I need to take a flight to go to a clinic for giving birth , he said I’m a spoiled prick, insulted me, almost hit me. Then my bf came, hit me in the face as I was replying to my father and dragged me to “our” room. I could go on for days, I’m tired of surviving. I never killed anyone, never been an addict, never had problems at school, but always been treated like crap since birth. I’m dreading the traumas my daughter will suffer from seeing her mother constantly hit by everyone. I want to die, I’m selfish as I have a baby in me, but what’s the point of surviving like this??? What’s the point of surviving like this?"
624,1,"I’ve been depressed ( knowingly ) since I was 11... did normal stuff a maladjusted kid would do- sulked a lot for years until I discovered drugs and alcohol, which eventually got me into lots of trouble ( I know, shocker!)- at 18 I was hospitalized for the depression... all it really did was start a cycle of overmedication and now, I can’t shut my damned mouth ( when I used to keep pretty much everything in)... that’s a double edged sword.. being open had gotten me in trouble too.. anyway- I was rotated through different meds through the course of a year or two ( after the hospitalization) and they all seemed to make me worse. I stopped... returned to bad habits because, well shit, at least I felt better some of the time and when I did feel bad- it made sense, too. 

Eventually tried Wellbutrin again since it was the only med that didn’t make me crazy AF.. eventually I ended up on Wellbutrin for years and quit using party drugs...got a job in the medical field after I quit partying for a while... helping others! Maybe that will lift my crippling depression! Alas, that didn’t work... I work for 4-5 years in my field and eventually I landed a charge at 28 after some family tragedies and hitting a hard(er) spot in my life.. 

Fast forward a bit- I’ve been thrown into double probation because I’m in the medical profession and obviously they want to assure public safety, and a dui charge as a professional is bad news.. so the state monitors me from the POs office and from the medical professional board’s  side.. medical professional probation is way more intense than the criminal side, provided you don’t screw up; obviously jail is a worse place to be than the board adding a few more months to a monitoring agreement...( I haven’t been drinking... I’ve been completely sober for over a year now, not even a glass of wine with meals or a beer after a rough day)... maybe that would lift my depression? You’d think, since alcohol is a depressant, right? 

NOPE.. tried viibryd at a very low dose, half the minimum therapeutic dose, in fact... ended up suicidal and the depression went off the charts.. worst it’s been in years ( taking Wellbutrin with it per my shitty medical probation- appointed shrink ) in all fairness, I warned her SSRIs made me batty. Anyway- that lifts, a few months later, I quit the Wellbutrin- maybe I don’t need meds, I think. Well, that was actually a fairly painless med to stop. Maybe a few days angrier than I felt okay. I mean, I use more nicotine now and I’m not super focused... but all in all, not a bad withdrawal like I’ve gotten from SSRIs . No more depressed than before. It’s been months since I stopped- 

I still feel depressed but now my therapist wants me to work on some sexual abuse issues from my past, which I’m frankly afraid to get into since any sort of alcohol or drug use could compromise my freedom and I don’t really wanna go back to that.. I’m afraid digging into that will end me, since it turns out I’ve got some fairly recent issues with a sexual assault  that I somehow smoothed over in my mind as an accident on his part? Don’t ask me how my brain works.. ugh... anywho- I’m pro pot, but I can’t really do that as it’s not permitted and I am not willing to lose my freedom or license for any substance on this planet.  

I just want to feel better. I don’t. I keep telling myself when I’m off all of this probation, I’ll feel better- but I was massively depressed before I was on probation. It’s been an issue for 18 years. It’s caused me a lot of heartache and traditional treatments have never worked. I got the gene site testing done but my psychiatrist won’t share my results- so I’m getting them sent to me directly from the company. Don’t have them yet..but yikes! What on earth kind of life have I lived? I’ve lived like- 3 different lives in the last 18 years.. all crippled by depression. I’m 29 and I just want this to stop. I’m good at my job, hence I’ve managed to keep it despite my little blip with the law man. People also seem a bit more forgiving with alcohol related crimes since a lot of people have broken laws relating to alcohol, just not gotten caught.. so I am thankful for that... but damn! I wish I could just be normal! Anyone else with treatment resistant depression? What worked, what didn’t? Depression has ruined my life and I desperately want out... all I want is contentment! I’m not even asking for happy- just to be content with my life. :/ Treatment resistant depression? Been trying to tackle this for 11 years with little success ( long post)"
625,1,"Anyone ever feel like they want to be left alone, like just shut down and not talk to anyone even talk to others online or texting, calling, just cut all communication.

626,1,"Ever since I can remember I have been the most negative person. No matter how hard I try to be positive my brain always says 'everything is pointless and you're a tiny spec of dust in the universe'. It's a irreversible personality trait , it's so deeply engraved in me I can't truly enjoy anything and it often leads me to wanting to die. Having said this I'm still extremely hard on myself, if I do anything wrong I'll be thinking about it all week but if someone else does something wrong I won't think twice to forgive and forget. I spent three years eating my thoughts away and now I'm a fat ugly mess which makes life that much harder with a brain like mine. What's the point. I'm considering becoming an alcoholic so I can just escape my brain. I'm going to kill myself after my parents pass away. That is for definite, that could be 30 years though and the thought of having to wait that long to escape my brain is sickening. Sorry if this post is all over the place but that's how my brain works . Funny thing about all this is my parents know I was a 'little' depressed before but the truth is it's much worse than they will ever know I'm just extremely good at hiding it and putting on a face as I don't want to be any more of a burden than I already am. This is the first time I've ever posted about myself being truthful. Thanks if you read this. Negative Thoughts"

629,1,"Anyone has that too? I met up with someone, anxious as i was i said to myself i will go and hang out and try to have fun and i did have fun, but when it was over. The crash, I just feel like a complete loser and i just drop. It wasn't anything the other person said. It was just me being alone again. Back to the place where i'm always sad, at home. 

I've barely left my home the past 6 years because the crash just hurts too much every time. From 2013 to 2019 I've left my house maybe 15 times. I didn't leave my house in 2014 and 2018 at all. Just because of the crash. It just sucks me further down then anything, and the thing is i always had ''the crash'' 


Before i stopped leaving my house i still went to school, and was actually popular. I was always hanging out and having fun with all my friends, going places exploring whatever. But every single time, when the day was over and we all went our separate ways to our homes. I always crashed, wanting to just jump in front of the metro that i took everyday. 


I realize i'm depressed and some of the friends i have left from those days push me to try to help out. They think i'm too anxious to go outside, but i'm too anxious for the crash. It completely wrecks my mental state to oblivion.

631,1,I’ve been feeling sad for about 2 weeks. It’s probably my birth control that’s been making me feel like this but I’ll get really sad over dumb things and want to cut myself because I’m so upset. I have no sex drive and thinking about touching myself makes me feel awful. I can’t understand why anyone would want to be friends with me (I basically have no close friends that make an effort to hang out) and I don’t understand how I can have a boyfriend who loves me as much as he does. I only understand it when I do stupid things and he gets mad at me; that’s when I know I deserve it. Been feeling sad
632,1,"Here I sit and watch my world come crumbling down
I cry for help but no one's around
Silently screaming I bang my head against the wall
It seems like no one cares at all
Always an emotion, but how can I explain
How can I explain
Kind of like the scent of a rose
With words I can't explain
The same with my pain
Caught up in emotion-Goes over my head
Goes over my head
Sometimes I got to think to myself is this life or death
Am I living or am I dead
The clock keeps ticking but nothing else seems to change
Problems never solved, just rearranged
And when I think about all the times that I've had
So few good-So many bad
I search for personality and I look for things I can not see

Love and peace flash through my mind
Pain and hate are all I find
Find no hope in nothing new
Never had a dream come true
Lies and hate and agony
Through my eyes that's all I see
If I'm gonna cry
Will you wipe away my tears?
If I'm gonna die
Lord please take away my fear
Before I drown in sorrow
Last thing that I'll say
How will I laugh tomorrow
If I can't even smile today
Today today, when I can't even smile today
Today today, when I can't even smile today
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today How can I laugh tomorrow"

Family, wife, kids, people who love me, people who need me, ..

I chill sometimes using weed, i swim, ..

I work, developing software, ..

I have a home.

I am M38.

and still ... 

I feel it, daily, lack of motivation.

More often than not, sadness creeps in, desperation.

It seems kinda pointless and wasteful, riding the elevator to the office, getting coffee, sitting in a cubicle.

Then, earning money, then spending it. Buying things we might not need. Respecting all kind of rules ..

I would like to feel more satisfaction.

I would like to improve myself.

I would like to change some thing, one thing for the better.

I feel depressed sometimes, sick of traffic, mad at the world, for not being a better place - more human and more tolerant, and less self obsessed. 

It could be more about values, more about evolving this race. I think we are doing it all wrong. I see much suffering and feel that I am not doing anything to solve any of the worlds issues.

I don't get it, why am I not happy, what should I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I thing about leaving, for a new place. Not knowing anybody and then dealing only with myself.

Sometimes I consider being homeless somewhere and then not dealing with anything in particular - just to drown in my own self pity.

Sometimes I wish to leave this earth.

What is wrong with this world ?

634,1,"I've been dating a girl who I am absolutely in love with for the past 5 years.
I have had other crappy relationships in my life and some of them weren't so bad to get away from, others sunk me down into a deep hole. Through all of them, and several other personal crisises I have been alone.


It has made me lose trust for most people and has put me through a lot of pain.
Though when it comes to her, I fully trust her and have never had any doubts about her cheating or any of that.

Last weekend she planned a trip and didn't invite me, went there with a bunch of guys, I was naturally upset because she said I wasn't invited, and I have been so called friends with these people. We have had our rough patches, but I always believed we would get through them.

Now shes coming back and telling me that she had a connection with one of them and that she wants to be in an open relationship and sleep with him.
I know some people are into that, and that's fine, but I'm absolutely not okay with it. She's telling me she wants to leave because she won't be able to live her life the way she wants to- in an open relationship.

Now I know what that means has to be done...
But stupid me, I decided to try and talk her into staying with me, and that she could be satisfied with me again I told her I would try to stop being such a slob, and it's true, I have been kinda shit, I accept that, ever since I started my job in an assembly line (4years now) I've been more uptight and not so energetic, but I've done nothing but care about her and give her everything I had to give and made promises that this job would pay off one day and we could have that little house in the woods that we always wanted.

I just feel like giving up again. My whole life has been one kick in the ass after another, I've only asked the universe for one thing, and it's really damned simple, for someone to love me the way that I love them. Not to be a millionaire, or to win the Nobel prize. I just want to live in the woods and be happy while I run around outside naked feeding my chickens.

This probably seems like a big mess, I am on my phone and I am extremely out of it right now, I feel like I want to jump out of my skin, and it has been non stop for about 3 days, I don't know what to do, I just want another human to talk to while I go through this, because Im not sure if I can handle doing it alone again. Someone please fucking help me Please help me"
635,1,"I spent most of my time  during high school and college depressed. And because of that, I don’t have a lot, if any, relationship experience and it makes me feel guilty and like I’ve missed out on core experiences.

I’m a female in my late 20s, and currently in a great relationship. However, he always talks about his previous relationships and hook-ups, and I’ve only ever been sexually active in one previous relationship (and it wasn’t a great experience at all). My other two “relationships” didn’t include sex (one for a personal reasons, one because we were long distance and never got to be together during our duration). 

My s/o isn’t ever try to make me feel bad for my lack of experience, but I just hate that I can’t engage in our conversations better. And now I look back which such anger because I feel like I am a 15 year old in a relationship for the first time. It isn’t fair, and I want to cry and go back in time and just push myself more or do SOMETHING instead of just sink inside myself.

But today was the first day I was able to get my self up early enough to ride my bicycle and watch the sun rise. 6 months ago I couldn’t even wake up by noon time and mentally I wasn’t even able to think until about three o’clock each day. And I had been trying to get up early enough for the sun for about a week and it was still tough. It’s tough falling asleep with anxiety about things and tough waking up depressed and scared in the morning. But today was the day. Life gave me the highest high, higher than all mountains, higher than all drugs, higher than anything. This morning was something else..."
639,1,"My classmate committed suicide and we learned about it because cops came to school looking for the guy's close friends to investigate. Two of my other classmates (one was my friend) was brought down to teacher's office but came back up crying. My friend came back to her place while the other guy told the whole class what was happening. 

He suffocated himself with plastic (maybe the day before, no one knew). He was the kind that believed in reincarnation (he was Christian in name but not in faith ig? If that makes sense). This gave me the feeling that he was living some sort of fantasy of his? Because he watches shit and reads novels with like reincarnation and in most of those, the main character would reincarnate but redeem themselves in the second life. This was my theory but there were also thoughts that he was depressed etc. 

My friend was crying so I invited her over to my place (we weren't allowed to change seats but whatever). The news was shocker already to me but my friend cried and through the cries managed to whisper to me smtg like: He left, he left me....a watch. His watch.

Every recess, she would ask him for his watch before heading out for prefect duty. This was what he left her. His watch. 

I didn't know how to treat the situation. I feel all sorts of feelings right now, but I feel more worried for my friend, who was still weeping when we left school. What can I do now? I'm desperate. My classmate committed suicide and I don't know how to feel about it"
640,1,I feel so lonely. I am trapped in my anxiety . I am only 17 and I can't enjoy life the way I want to. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years and I feel so broken . I am empty inside I wake up every day and I can't find a reason to live anymore. It hurts me so bad that I can't speak with her and I every time I think of her is like I am punched in the stomach. I am suicidal for months now and I was about to attemt a suicide about 10 times but I don't (thank god ) . I have a sleeping disorder and I am sad from the time I wake up till I am asleep again. I can't get professional help 'cause I am underage and I have to tell my mother in order to talk with a psychologist . I am so mentally bad I don't know what to do
641,1,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but at the moment, I’m not able to ask it anywhere else. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety back in high school (about 5 years ago). Recently, I decided to start tracking how often my anxiety and depression occurs so I could write it down and see if there were some lifestyle changes I could make. While doing that, I noticed my depression has a somewhat cyclical nature. It shows up in short bursts; usually lasting up to about a week or so, then disappearing for a couple weeks, and then returning again. In those weeks of not having depression I feel fine. I’m energetic, active, positive, and can function normally. But, in those short bursts of depression I feel remarkably low, fatigued, and almost like the world is completely crashing down on me. I feel completely numb and detached from everything, and these changes in mood don’t typically come with any kind of trigger. It just feels like they switch on and off. Does anyone else’s depression do this? Is this normal with depression?"
642,1,"I recently came out of an abusive relationship. She had severe mental health issues. I bore the brunt. It became too much.

I've gone through the mourning period. I've tried to move on. I've got a lot of positives in my life. My family. Friends. All that jazz. I was doing ok. Many people have said I am coping better than they expected.

But I'm sat here, with a beer. All I want to do is drink until last call. I want to forget.  I see my friends and their  relationships and think ' why can't I have that?' I want to feel safe in someone's arms. That feels unobtainable right now.

I feel like a giant sigh. Suddenly it just appears"
643,1,"Just why...

&amp;#x200B;

I always was this person who tries to take care about other people so they wont feel like I always did. Lonely, abandoned, hopeless, powerless etc. Sometimes I manage to help people to stand up from the floor and it makes me pretty happy. I tend to care really much. Its really nice to feel appreciated and like you were useful for at least a moment. But then, those peoplestop caring and leave for ridiculous reasons. So it ends up with actually ME broken. Always falling into little pieces. I really dont understand anymore who I am, why I am like this, why all my happiness is to sacrifice myself for other people to make them better. I am doing it all my life but I am always this invisible girl that no one notices her pain and struggles. Sometimes I just think maybe indeed everyone has his own fate.

644,1,Hi. I wanna kill myself but I'm scared of dying. My parents are so verbally abusive it makes me so sad and mad that I want to leave this home. Please help me and tell me what I should do. I'm only 11. i wanna fucking end this already

646,1,"So I was dating this girl for just under 2 years until we broke up in Feb last year. I ended it because I didn't feel good enough for her. Since then things have been bad. They were bad during the relationship and before it but because I'd developed a dependancy on her my mental health just took a dive for the worst. I was confused and insecure throughout the relationship. Whenever I tried breaking up with her she would jump on me and forcefully perform oral sex on me. And before that she'd ask me a multitude of questions. It became a pattern. The confusion came when we broke up for 3 months and the middle of it got into a fight and she told me ""why would i want your small useless penis"" I haven't been able to get over the abuse that took place and this combined with my low self esteem and self hatred has put me in a really bad place since the relationship ended. Not to mention the fact that up until last week she would call me or text me from time to time but I wouldn't respond. And when I wouldn't she'd start getting verbally abusive and make all kinds of threats. Speaking of threats she once told me that she would make me ""never want to go back to school again.( We were at the same uni) She was my first relationship and I've been tryna tell myself that if I pretend we were never together it  might help me get over it but it's not helping. I told my friends about the abuse and they didn't take it seriously because sexual abuse doesn't happen to men right? It sucks that someone who I was reliant on and put my trust in betrayed me by sexually abusing me repeatedly like she did. Tired"
647,1,hi this is my first post on here but does anyone else experience summer depression to the point where it’s unbearable i feel as if i can’t even leave my house due to lack of motivation and people used to invite me to things and i would lie and say i was busy and now people I’ve just stop inviting me places and i feel even worse i haven’t even left my house in literal days and more and more time passes this summer i get more and more depressed i honestly wish i was back in school to at least have a routine set in place and i got to socialize more summer depression
648,1,"What is thinking? Something inside tells me something negative or I'm dumb. Ugly. Not dateable. Any future partner will be using me  I have to spend mental effort to oppose it and reason or tell myself that I'm not. It's like my brain just naturally inclines towards self loathing in a passive unstimulated state. It's the worst at night in bed or walking to places alone. 

I feel like I torment myself by trying to put myself down. If I step out of my view I know my life is in an okay spot. I have potential and things can get better. I just don't feel confident at all. A lot of self doubt. It feels somewhat existential too. 

I feel like I have to do so much to reach a point where I can consider myself an adult or human. I feel useless because there's so much I don't know. Life skills. Future job skills. I compare myself to people my age or younger and they got their life sorted. They look great. Great job. Etc. 

Yet rationally I know I shouldn't compare. I wasted my life earlier on games. I didn't sacrifice for that. I'm planning on learning things. Like the other part of me knows it's just a matter of learning things. Building confidence. 

But one part of me is trying to reach a robotic ideal where I am maximally useful or reliable. I can do everything or know how to help I'm every situation. I'm fully useful and reliable. This view is less about emotion and just being good. Optimal. Has experience in everything.

But in reality that's impossible. I'm too emotional of a person. I guess because I'm conflicted about that I self loathe. For being stupid. For not having much life exp. For not being able to help people as much as I can. I feel useless. Like I'll just become a walking cashgrab of a person (read: cuck (though I'm gay) tool or daddy) in future. 

It's like two sides of me are fighting. A depressive and negative influence against the side that sees a bright future ahead. Basically I know what to do and what mindset I should adopt. But I don't do it. Feels like an infectious mental curse that corrupts my thinking unless I actively internally rebuke it. This ends up taking a lot of mental energy sometimes. I dunno. 

I don't even know if it's depression. Maybe a sign or weak form. I know compared to others I haven't had anything terrible happen to me. Or maybe just being a passive observer is that terrible thing? I just feel like I have no reason to feel so bad. It's guilt in a way. Guilt that I'm doing well at least career wise but I'm still mentally still so weak. Like these feelings are invalid and should not be. I don't show anything or have anything to warrant it. 

Maybe I'm just afraid of pain. Both physical (for physical development and trying new physical challenges) and mental (for trying new social challenges and failing or being super awkward).

End of thoughts / vent. 

Tldr - bad inside voice telling me I'm stupid. Ugly. Won't ever be anything useful. Logical brain knows objectively I'm in a good spot. Just have to progress with life. Learn better social skills or conversation skills and manage social anxiousness. Try be more in a positive mindset. But still end up defaulting to self loathe mode. Self-doubt and a negative self-loath voice"
649,1,"This thought is just constantly running through my head that I need to get away from everyone and everything. Even my boyfriend and my family. I don’t even think anyone would realise I would be gone, it’s not like I have friends anyway. I just want to get in my car and leave! (I also don’t mean this in a suicidal way, I physically want to run away) All I want to do is run away from everyone"
650,1,"&lt;super long post&gt;
I don’t really know how to start this so here it is. 
Struggling with depression and suicide can be really hard. You might have known someone who has went through it or you might be going through it yourself. It hides it’s true face to everyone around you and can cause serious life and work related issues that you never knew were going to happen from that first day 3 years ago when you just said to yourself “I’m a little sad today”. Everyone told you that it was just a phase and that you would get better if you go outside or go out with friends. The truth is, you don’t even know why you’re here anymore. So doing any of those things is the last thing on your mind. I’ve been struggling with depression for 3 years and I’ve tried to kill myself twice. I’m not making this post to make anyone feel sorry for me or to come send their love and support. I’m making this post because I want people to understand that you can’t put a bandaid on emotions and expect it to just go away. This post is something that helps me and I know most of you don’t care, but I need to do something for myself. I’m drowning in my own mind and this is the only way to get out. My depression is suffocating and the unending itch to just end it all never goes away completely. It’s always there. That little voice in your head that tells you everyone hates you and no one would care about you if you were gone. Always nagging. I don’t need you to post saying “I would miss you” because if you understood you would know. A million I would miss you’s is nothing compared to an I love you from someone who understands you’re in pain and wants to be there just as an emotional support. Just to know that this person is there, no judging, no criticism. They just are there. That’s what someone going through depression needs and then it just takes time. It’s not an overnight process. I’ve been in therapy on and off for almost 6 months now and I’ve gone up and crashed back down hard. Just be there for that person. If you know someone who’s going through a hard time. Call them on the phone and tell them you love them. It honestly means the world to someone who is sad to hear they are loved.

I'm alr prepared for the worst. 

When shit happens I'm the only one who can keep a straight face, and the the first guy who can move on. People tell me how can I maintain my emotions so well, as if I got no heart.

I really can't give a definitive answer. But these are my thoughts. Just wanna know if anyone is in the same boat. 

Thank you all. Stay happy. Is anyone feeling some kind of comfort and solace in your depression?"
655,1,"Hello everyone,

I'm using a throwaway account as this is an uncomfortable and private subject for me to address.

I measure at just over 5 inches with not a great girth, and while this could be deemed average, depending on what research you look at, this has affected my general confidence and has left me lonely and generally unhappy in all facets of my life. It doesnt help that I'm 6ft2in, with a big frame... things dont exactly look proportional.

I'm 31 and have been single for the past 9 years with very few sexual encounters during that time. The reason being I dont feel good enough or adequate enough due to my size. I'm not a bad looking guy and my friends dont understand why I've struggled finding a relationship, but it's not exactly a topic I feel comfortable discussing with them. I can explain that I'm sad and lonely to them for support, but the underlying issue never gets bought up.

The trigger for this particular post is that I saw a joke memey thing on Facebook, that was directed at women, that said something along the lines of ""The more I'm single and the older  I get, my opening line for guys is ""Hi nice to meet you, how big is your dick?"", I havent got the time to be messing around"". Its got 30k likes and all these women saying ""Me!"" Or tagging their friends saying ""lol you""... and it defeats me. So what you're saying is I can't, and will never, be good enough. People like to say ""Penis size doesnt matter"", but those 30 thousand ladies didnt seem to think so, with no one saying otherwise. I'm not exactly experienced enough to ""motion of the ocean"" my way through.

I'm finding it hard to talk to women, chat someone up on a night out, because if it leads to anything I have to through the psychological torture of removing my clothes at some point. 

Its fucking me up, I'm so lonely and miserable and it all comes down to this feeling of inadequacy. I dont know how to deal with it. The misery creeps it's way into my normal life and theres no way of fixing it aside from fixing my brain, but I've spent half my life agonizing about it, so I dont see how my mindset changes.

Perhaps I need to make other lifestyle changes, like getting fit and losing some weight to make me feel better. But it's hard to motivate myself. I dont know. I just hate myself. My smaller penis is ruining my life."
656,1,"Finally starting to feel physically better after a very long fiasco with some health problems, and all of a sudden I remembered how fucking lonely I am. I almost wish I could feel like shit again if it meant I didn’t need to feel this/had people actually care about me I forgot depression was a thing"
657,1,"So I was a really bright person before my old friends decided it would be funny to hurt my feelings, my body and other atrocious acts. Then one day it happened, they told me that I was a waste of human space, life and resources, they said that I shouldn't have ever been born, they said I should've commited suicide. After that fateful day I had lost all hope of moving onwards with my very existence. About 3 weeks after the day I began cutting myself. It got to the point where I wished I had never met them. They eventually kicked me on all social platforms. Soon after they began to torment me on my YouTube. There was no reason for them to do any of that. Eventually I tried suicide so many times;all attempts failed.                                                         To this day I still think about what I did wrong, why I ever met them. To this day I still cut myself but not as bad. Also to this day I still doubt myself at everything.  But If this ever happens to you I recommend confront them about it, but I never did. My ""friends"" abandoned me, Abused me and more atrocious acts."
658,1,"Tired of feeling like shit, tired of having to pretend I’m ok, I’m tired of not enjoying anything, tired of trying all different kinds of depression meds that either never work or stop after 2 or 3 months. I’m tired of being tired all the time.

660,1,"I was diagnosed with depression about 7 months ago. At times it feels like it has gotten better but then it feels like it’s gotten worse. For the past two weeks I have felt a strong urge to self harm. 

I don’t know why since I have never done it in the first place. I don’t understand where this urge is coming from but it literally keeps me up at night. I get tempted to do it but eventually I become exhausted and fall asleep.  Im a wuss for any sort of physical pain which has me even more confused as to why I want to hurt myself. 

Can anyone relate to what I’m saying. Am I crazy? Tempted to self harm"
661,1,"I think I have some kind of a mental illness or something because I feel like I could commit suicide just to prove it to everyone.

Seriously what is wrong with me, why would I kill myself to prove a thing? I don't know that myself but I just, believe it and in a fucked up way, want it. What's wrong with me?"

I feel so guilty all the time and it just makes everything worse because I end up feeling like a bad mom.. even though they're being fed I feel like we should be eating together. Instead they eat in front of the tv while I skip dinner and hide in bed.

Today though, I'm proud to say that between all the tears I've managed to make breakfast and lunch. Getting ready to mash potatoes for dinner now. 

Mostly just venting here. I've had a really bad weekend and the person who said they would be there for me absolutely was not. So I'm on the interwebs now. Having trouble feeding my kids"
665,1,"i don't know if i am suffering from depression and i don't like to be the person to make a big fuss out of nothing but i just feel like a lot of these symptoms represent how i feel. The thing is, i don't feel like someone who's depressed because some things still make me happy and i can still laugh. But i never have the motivation to do anything in life besides sitting inside watching tv, gaming and when i hang out with friends its just to sit in their room and smoke weed. I almost always wake up very tired, and after 4 maybe 5 hours that fades away and i feel better. When i'm tired it feels like im just an emotionless person. I always stress myself out about a lot of small things while i still am not the person to care a lot about big stuff, it's like my priorities are completely f'd up. I used to think it was just me being tired and a while back i had a period where almost everyday i woke up for school i had to throw up in the morning so i kinda thought i was just in a bad period of my life. I'm still a happy person when im watching shit or playing games but besides that i don't enjoy life that much anymore. I am a social person but i almost always make up an excuse to stay at home.

I've had some suicidal thoughts, but no real intentions of killing myself just me stressing about nothing. I've become somewhat scared to do some things that are not scary at all because im afraid i will get nauseous for no reason. It all feels like a mental thing more than physical because thoughts pop up that i cant let go off and they make me feel a certain way. It's not a weed thing either because even in periods where i don't smoke i have this problem.

I don't have trouble sleeping, i'm just always tired with bags under my eyes. I might have restless leg syndrome which i will get checked out Friday but even if i do have rls, i dont feel like my problems would fade away if i got treatment for it. Sometimes i just look at the future and feel like i'll be a fuckup for the rest of my life because i don't have the motivation to do anything usefull for most of the time

I still am convinced i'm tired and not depressed but i wonder if it's worth checking out.

I would really appreciate if people could help me out because i don't want my life to be like this. Advise would really be appreciated"
666,1,"Home alone today and instead of working or tackling any number of projects around the house, I’ve pulled all the curtains, put on some sweats, called the dogs, and have crawled into bed. I think I’ll stay here all day. Seems like the safest place to be. Clouds outside, dark inside"
667,1,"Off and on for the past three years I've been teaching myself to play the guitar and sing. I've taken a couple guitar lessons and also a few singing lessons along the way, but mostly I've just been slogging along by myself. I can play through some songs, once I learn them, but it still takes a while for me to really pick up a song. In the past I've dealt with social anxiety issues, so for me to be able to sing/play guitar in front of people has been a huge, lifelong challenge. One thing that I've been really proud of is that I performed at a few open mic nights. My boyfriend is also a musician who has been performing solo and in various bands for over 20 years. 

I feel like I should quit. I feel like music shouldn't be for me. I'm a 35 year old woman and I'm just now learning to play. And I'm not very good at it. In my heart I feel like I can sing. When I'm alone I love to sing and think it sounds good. But, as soon as I sing in front of anyone or listen to a recording of myself singing I realize how terrible it is. I hate that I'm so old and not very good at anything. My boyfriend and I have tried to play together, like an acoustic duo type thing, with the intention of doing some open mics together, but every time we try to do it, I feel like shit and we never get anywhere. Last night, he took me to a rehearsal studio because he wanted me to have the experience of playing and singing with real professional equipment in an environment designed specifically for the purpose of making music. He thought it might help me feel better about myself and that it would just be fun. It was fun. We did practice a lot of stuff and I sang. But, after I just feel terrible. Like, so embarrassed that I even tried to sing like that. I'm sure it sounded horrible. My boyfriend says it sounded great and he even recorded me singing/playing a song because he wanted me to hear how good it sounds. But, I don't believe him. 

I love to sing and play guitar, but I get so depressed that it'll never amount to anything. I just feel like there's no point to it. I'll never be good enough to play with other people. I'll never be good enough to get over this anxiety/self-consciousness. It's just a waste of time and I feel like other people look down on me for even trying. Music and the meaning of life"
668,1,"When I was 14  to 16 i thought what i had was normal. I thought it just were typical waves of ""downs"" that every teenager experiences. Online Friends told me that it wasn't normal. They kept insisting I should see a doctor (that's the route you usually take in my country . Doctor - Psychiatrist - Therapist) With every year it got worse. At 16  i said ""fuck it, why not? they'll just agree with me and let me go"" 
They didn't. They said it sounds like this illness and made an appointment with a psychiatrist so they could properly determine what I have.
Everything was going fast. And good. I've met my (then future) therapist who i could easily talk to about other topics( about movies, politics, hobbies, humans and dogs etc). I only had to wait a month, because he was settling in a village that was near my home.
But I still don't believe it.
I think I'm just overreacting. Too sensitive. Need to ""man up"".
I don't have enough scars. Not enough suicide attempts. Not enough mental breakdowns. Not enough panic attacks. ""Other people have it so much worse. I'm an awful person"" ""I'm looking for attention""  ""i can't have it. I'm way too young"" 

So i need to punish myself. For ever going to the doctor, to the psychiatrist, to the therapist. For wasting their more than precious time.
For still doing it.

I use compasses and ram then into my arm. You can't see any of it after a few days. No scars.

I'm a waste of your time too.
I'm sorry Despite ""proof"" i don't think i have it"

671,1,"I have a feeling I won’t be able to get up and do it today either. I’m sorry I’m so disgusting :( sorry I just need to apologise to my real self sorry sorry sorry I’m so sorry

Edit: i also just want to rant about how horrible it is to have period cramps when ur in a vulnerable mental state. I was feeling better yesterday and now my period is dragging me back into the stupid hole Sorry to myself for... literally just not brushing my teeth for days but sorry"
672,1,"Just me venting, guys.

I recently went through a horrible break up...a break up unlike any I had ever experienced before. Part of me feels lost, like it left with him. I don't think the same, feel the same, see my surroundings in the same way. Everything in my life just feels foreign and lonely. I have already been struggling with severe depression/anxiety nearly all my life (since I was 9) and I CANNOT, despite how much I will myself to try, see a healthy and happy way out of this depressive episode. I can't possibly manifest enough positivity to bring myself out of it this time....and I'm scared. Im legitimately worried about my well-being. My stability. My mental state. I cant do this, not this time. Its too much. And I don't have a support system anymore. I dont have anyone in my life who truly understands me and my depression...so, I guess I just don't know where to go from here If I could be anything in the whole world, I'd only want to be his"
673,1,"I really want to kill myself. I want to so badly. I’ve wanted to since I was a child. I was physically and mentally abused as a child. I was made fun of by mom for not having friends in pre school kindergarten, elementary and I was beaten bloodied countless times and my calves were whipped as punishment until they were freshly purple. I would be regularly kicked out of the house for long periods of time at a young age and would have to sleep on my doorstep.(one time neighbor saw me and my mom accused me of looking for pity and trying to make her look bad). 

I’m 21 and never had a girlfriend. I’ve fucked one girl , my freshman year of college who broke my heart and made me realize how needy and insecure I was. I haven’t been with a girl in 3 yrs now and every attempt I now make ends in vain. All girls ghost me and it destroys my confidence. I’m a freak. I’m mentally destroyed now. All my friends have girlfriends or have game/can Pull and I hate going out w them and being the only one who has to be alone. 

I really want to kill myself. I’ve been depressed my whole life and suffered so many social embarrassments. I’m not bad looking so I’ve always gotten decent female attention but people I met would eventually realize how weird I was and it would become a talking point. No girl in my hometown would ever reply to me bc they know how weird I am. 

Only thing keeping me alive is my little siblings. I’m 8 and 10 yrs older than the two of them and I don’t want them to have to go through the loss of a family member. I just don’t know how long that want is going to last. I’ve been thinking about it 24/7 nonstop for the last year. I used to smoke weed everyday to try and ease the pain but I’ve been off it for the last two months bc I don’t want to cover a crack with a band aid. 

Idk what I should do. My mind is deteriorating, Every day I think"
674,1,suicide is all I can think about. Not much to say
675,1,"I want a cat. Or at least a small animal. But mostly a cat or baby. I just want to hold them in my arms.

Cats:
They are so soft. So so soft. They are so precious so warm. They are literally everything. They are so therapeutic. I just want to hold them. I can’t get one cause literally everyone in the household is allergic to cats. My dad has a severe hatred for cats. My bonus mom likes them but she’s severely allergic. I just want to hold a cat. Or be able to hold one. I miss BW she was so kind. I wish I knew were she was. We were the best. I miss seeing her.

Baby: 
They literally depend on you. Their eyes are closed all the time so they just sit there. And when you hold them they just lay there. Being a baby. So soft and warm. And their skin is like silk. Like they are literally perfect angels. Like I just want to hold a baby or hold a cat like a baby. Just kiss them and tell them everything is going to be okay. Like they have so much freaking potential all right there. In the little body. They could grow up to be like the fucking president or soemthing. I wish I had a baby that never grew up. Just quiet. I’ll just sit in my chair and just hold them. Cry while they lay there. 

Or I just want to cuddle. I wish I had a boy/girl friend. We could cuddle and spoon each other. It’s ya boi, depression."
676,1,I can isolate for MONTHS when my mental health is at its worst. Not even a warning.  I just drop off the face of the earth. I have ruined so many relationships in my life (and opportunities). My social life has crumbled. Then it becomes a vicious cycle...I’ll isolate and then I won’t contact that person/people even longer out of shame and embarrassment for how long I haven’t communicated. Anyone relate to this? Want my social life back but can’t stop isolating. Has anyone else always struggled with severe isolation?
677,1,"I FEEL like a failure***


I switched to a division 2 position at my factory. Which is Forklift, Cherry Picker, Tugger, and Walkie. I trained on each job for about 10 minutes before he pulled me off. He made comments like “I hope you’re better at this next job than these previous ones” and then when I did picking my brain froze after being 16 feet in the air.  I SUCKED at Picker and walkie.....walkie was even WORSE. I couldn’t align the pallet with the designated drop off area no matter how hard I tried. The instructor asked me “did I have dyslexia” and after everything was done I got up to the evaluation room and started bawling. I think he passed me because he felt sorry for me. I decided to go for forklift and I think I failed"
678,1,Six years ago was a hard point in my life. One of my biggest coping skills for particularly hard events is simply _forgetting_. I stumbled upon something in an old journal that I had completely forgotten. My parents were still undergoing a vicious custody battle and I was deep in depression and anxiety. This was when I was close to my worst. My grandmother was also trying to get custody. Of just me. Only me. None of my other 5 siblings. She was really fighting for that. I feel a sense of grief having discovered that again. It always scares me when I find something else big that fell from retrievable memory... What else have I forgotten? And how am I going to cope with all these memories coming back to me? Found a forgotten memory.
679,1,"First of all, I am currently at a stable position.

Usually my biggest goal in life is to help others with their mental health, to be there when someone feels like they have no one to turn to, because I needed that too as some point.

However currently I stumbled opon someone I wanted to be a friend for but lost all my respect recently.

This person texts me in the middle of the night, questioning their character traits, which I always answer as honest as possible, even tho some things might feel bad at first. 
It's better to answer 'I don't know you enough to judge this' than lying just for their sake.

I have huge empathy for everyone I care for and it's getting hard to be off help.
As this person told me about their past I literally thought ""that's actually not too bad"" and told him on the other side that it doesn't matter if someone else has it worse, feelings are always valid. Period.

The talk kept going and the more he told me, the more I had the urge to run away because I feel like this person just desperately wants attention. 

I don't really think this person knows what real depression feels like, nor is willing to listen to my advices.
At the end of our talk, where I dedicated hours of my time, he told me about his sleeping pills and that if he decides to kill himself he wants his brother to have his Ps4... 

This literally killed me inside because this is such a stupid thing to even think about in a matter of the discussion...

I actually feel used now and I have no idea how to deal with this person anymore... How am I supposed to cope?"
680,1,"All that I can think of when I hear the word ""Death"" is nothing. Just.. nothing.

The mere thought of that word makes me feel like my head is trying to mess with me, even though I am fully aware it will happen at one point.

Explaining doesn't help either, since all that I could imagine getting from it is the nothing. That dark, empty, soulless void that eventually disappears. It's freaky to think about it, but when people speak it out, it sounds like something you want? 

I don't think I'm suicidal. But having the ability to just stop everything sounds peaceful. Sounds like something I can finally control, other than the tiny things in life. Write what you think death is like."
681,1,"My depression has gotten worse now to the point where I've started to hit my face hard,i have given my self a bloody nose,busted lip,black eye and a chiped tooth. Why am i like this? I've started to hit my self"

684,1,"I’ve recently came out as transgender to my parents after the New Year. They’re very conservative catholics and we live in Ireland in a small town, so they kind of don’t talk to me anymore. I go to college about an hour and a half away, and was able to live on my own and rebuild my life.

Until the shop I was working at had to close and I couldn’t pay for rent anymore. I don’t have many friends anymore and I have no one to borrow money off, and in Ireland you aren’t able to apply for most social welfare if you’re still enrolled in College. I was meant to be saving money to go to Athens for the European University Debating Championships, but now I can’t even afford basic things. I’ve only been able to eat bread and peanut butter most days and I think I’m going to be homeless soon. I don’t know why no one wants to hire me anymore.

I have Bipolar Disorder, and usually take 400mg of Quetiapine a day, but I’ve been taking 100mg so I don’t run out as fast, but I only have enough to last me until Wednesday.

I just don’t know what to do or where to turn.
Can someone please give me any actionable advice other then get a job, because I’m trying my best but it just keeps getting more difficult. I’m not able to pay for Rent, Food, Medication or anything anymore and it’s eating me alive."
685,1,"I’ve been sleeping so much and still feel so exhausted. Last night I had napped a lot that I wasn’t as tired as I thought and tossed and turned all night. The second i would notice I was awake, the most triggering thoughts would come to surface. I’m so exhausted, everywhere. I just need some piece of mind. I’ve been dealing with night terrors and lots of fatigue"
686,1,"Lately I am completely at a lost. I have a job i really dislike, coworkers that i dont really care about and my parents arent really empathetic with me. I don't feel that im being respected both at work and at home: my coworkers often make funny comments at me like im cute or im so handsome as in i need to be reminded of that everyday. My parents treat me like a child, they think im a lazy asshole because i only do things in the house when being asked. My sister has THE attitude with everyone in my family, especially me since im the only one balled enough to called her a BITCH. I told her ""what you are doing is passive aggressive and u need to stop"" and she had the audacity to smirk at me. Fcking bitch if my mother isnt there i'd have smashed her face in. My family is well off but i just want to move out and live alone but my salary fcking sucks so that's that. I feel that i am never going to change, and im working toward becoming a psychologist and everything just spell out to me that im a walking contradiction. I want to do so much that it turned out i have done nothing ever since i graduated 4 years ago. cannot pay attention to anything"
687,1,"Like, how do I tell them it’s not worth it? All while I do everything so they get to live? I used to want to die; now there’s a dumbass growing inside me, and they need me to live."
688,1,Is there any way to make this affordable? I live in New Jersey Inpatient care without insurance?
689,1,"OF COURSE IT MATTERS, DUMMY! if i lack basic emotions, why would you say if it matters or not? there are many things i would love to express but i cant simply because i lack the emotion to do it.

if i could experience sadness i could do many things. i could tell people about how much has happened and what i want to change. i could finally get things off my chest without sounding like i made it up for attention. i could try and speak to someone and express them what im truly feeling.

if i could experience happiness i wouldnt even be on this reddit, typing this out to people that feel the SAME EXACT WAY I DO!! if i could express emotions like these, i could finally tell people things that would otherwise make them question if im ok or not! IM NOT OKAY, DAMNIT! HOW HARD IS IT TO KNOW THAT?

..then i think about those thoughts. the thoughts in my head saying this stuff? it makes me feel duller. knowing that if i try and talk to people it will usually not work out well. if someone wants me to be happy i cant express it properly. if its a sad moment i would just stand there and look like nothing happened at all.

im weird. so i feel dull. does that matter?"
690,1,can you help me think of a reason to live? because i honestly can't think of anything right now and i just want to stop from existing. why should i keep on living?
691,1,"Yeah sure I procrastinate all my courses but I get my work done so I must be fine. 

I have bad days where I can’t get out of bed but it’s never weeks on end so I must be fine. 

I don’t feed myself regularly but my boyfriend and I eat dinner together most nights so I shouldn’t worry. 

I wait until the last possible minute to get out of bed for work but I still show up and am great at my job so I can’t really be depressed. 

I stay home and never have motivation to do the things I want but I’m just having a day off at home which is normal. 

I have no sex drive but it’s probably because of my birth control so it’s not an issue. 

I hate myself and have no internal drive but I’m a functioning adult so I must be ok. 

I don’t have the signs of depression that I grew up hearing about so I must not be depressed. I must just be lazy and unmotivated. I talk myself out of getting any help because my issues don’t look the way I was taught depression looks."
692,1,"I was raised in an abusive household and pulled out of school
To escape the abuse throughout my teens I stayed in my room 
I never took care of myself and now my teeth are ruined

I have no energy levels and it seems something is always in the way 
Lifes so hard I really wish I wasn't born Why try?"
693,1,"I'll start by saying that I am beyond lucky... I have a good job, people respect me in my professional life, and I live comfortably. I work from home and, honestly, I find work to be very easy; it pays well, so I don't have to worry about money. I have a small group of friends, and they're cool. 

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I find it all so boring. I have no desire to improve myself (to what end?). I feel like nothing I do matters, I'm not even sure there are things that matter -- everything ends in the inevitable heat-death of the universe, it's not like we can change anything. I don't really like interacting with people -- I stopped dating, because I hate everything about it. I'd rather stay at home than interact with people (even my friends). Everything just seems so draining. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see a psychiatrist every 3 months and a therapist every week. I've taken about 12 different types of anti-depressants with no luck (SSRIs and SNRIs), as well as some things like Rexulti and Abilify as supplements. I tried ketamine therapy and I tried 'shrooms, with no real change in mood.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep trying to make goals/plans and fail to follow-through. I think part of this is that I just don't care.

I take medicine for anxiety and depression. I guess they work? At least I can function. I feel nothing"
695,1,"I’ve suffered with depression for like 4 years and was almost at the verge of taking my own life when I made a new friend and we’ll as cliche as this must sound she pulled me out of it.

Now we’ve been dating 2 years and we are both so in love with each other and we want this to last forever but we’re both moving to college in two different countries and even though we’ve agreed to keeping it long distance and all that and that we’ll meet for like a month every 2-3 months, I just feel like I’m going to loose her entirely before these 4 years of university are over and on god I feel like my insides are crushing into each other. Were supposed to leave for uni towards the end of September and I feel like I might loose the love of my life and it’s making my heart break bit by bit everyday. I know a lot of you will suggest going to the same college and all that but it’s too late to change choices now as our courses are entirely diff etc. and we went with the uni that was best for us. I cry myself to sleep every night and I wake up afraid that today is another day closer to moving away from her. Losing out"
696,1,"Is it possible this isn’t depression, but just a lack of interest in things? A lack of desire to keep going, because there is nothing there for me? No matter how many anti-depressants I take, they can’t just give me things to enjoy doing right? Isn’t possible for somebody to just not enjoy things without being depressed?"

Anyways now I’m triggered on the daily and idk what to do about it
It could be a smell or sound or thing I see and I’m reminded of the hospital or something that happened while I was there
It won’t stop. I’m triggered by these random things and sent into a weird place mentally.
I’m crying and I feel like I’m hyperventilating. I’ve been triggered here and there by it but never this often or intense 
Fuck idk what to do or why I’m writing all of this but if you read this thanks for tuning 
Also if you got any tips I’d be happy to hear them Just triggered tingz"
699,1,When your depressed think about the happy and good times in your life instead of the bad if that doesn't help then remember your perfectly imperfect and you are here for a reason so stay alive long enough to find that reason! Think about the good times..

I bet it was her new bf that wants me to move out that was talking to her. She showed no interest in my life and never pushed me at all to even go to school and now she wants to kick me out.

705,1,"Just venting here. 2019 has been one of the worst times of my life for me. I did it to myself though. At the end of March, I went into my ex’s house when she wasn’t there to get some of my stuff. I let myself in because I knew the door was unlocked. I was absolutely shit faced when I went over there and did some other stuff too which I’m not proud of. She ended up calling the cops and pressing charges on me.

   Ever since then, my life has spiraled out of control. I lost my job of 7 years, and now I have pending criminal charges. One of the charges is criminal trespassing, which is a felony. It was in the paper and everything. Everyone thinks i’m nuts. I also have no job and have to pay for a lawyer. I’ll be broke soon. I’ve ruined my life.

   I’m 25 years old and still live with my grandmother. It’s just me and her. We take care of each other. She’s really the only thing that’s keeping me here. I feel like such a fucking loser. I’ve lost pretty much everything, besides her. I lost the girl, the job, my good name. I’m literally ashamed to exist. I need to start looking for a job but I just don’t feel like doing anything. I don’t feel like being a person. 

  It’s a lot all at once. It’s a bad break up, losing a job, and dealing with legal trouble all at fucking once. I realized I did this to myself. It sucks. I’m so lonely and I fucking miss her. How crazy is that? I miss this girl who is now most likely afraid of me. It sucks. I’m just at an absolute low right now and it feels like I’ll never fully be ok again. I am at such a low point right now"

I wake up, I sit in bed and stare at the ceiling, I'm too sad to eat, cut off virtually all my friends, and I'm too intimidated to come with my mom to the supermarket.

709,1,"While is clear that happyness is better than sadness (is there a better term?), I'm not sure how to include nothingness in the equation.

We could say that it is not comparable - because when your conscious doesn't exist, YOU don't exist, so you can't experience or compare anything.

&amp;#x200B;

But I can't stop FEELING that nothingness would be better than sadness, even through I can't formulate it logically. And I also feel that nothingness is not worst than happyness, what is weird giving my previous feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys thing about it? As you can see, i'm confuded and i'm not sure how my depression is impacting my view on the subject.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should have been more clear, the nothingness that i'm referring to is the non existence of yourself, not the absence of emotions. How do we compare nothingness, happyness and sadness?"
710,1," 

hello, i'm throwing a SOS here as doctors in my country were not able to help me... has seen a bunch from several specialties (endocrinologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, immunologist etc) for 3/4 years without any amelioration, result or proper diagnostic.

i will try to make it as short as possible, let me know if other details are needed. 25 female, caucasian, europe, 1m60, 52 kg, currently no medication other than topical steroids for my eczema.sorry for the english.

I basically would like to know if what i am experiencing is ""normal"" and it's indeed something 'psychological', that i'm not the only case in this world, a confirmation that is depression/anxiety/stuff of this kind

p.S

Basically i've been through a quite rough period of my life a few years ago (a bit bullied, not comfortable at school etc), nothing that serious but i am a quite sensitive person. I developed some anxiety after it.

1. 3 years of my life, i stuggled to live and done everything with lots of effort. I basically forced myself and my body to keep up and be able to study etc. during those years my eczema was really awful (not sure if it was indeed atopic eczema or something else, but there was hives/itching and chronic flares up and scars).
2. 2 years of my life were in bed. going to the doctors to see if there's something wrong, blood tests positive, mri fine, sleep test fine. living with parents, being financially supported by them.

my main symptoms: you know the feeling you have when you have temperature (40 celsius degrees)? the feeling in the head? i had that (head feeling unwell). sometimes like someone had hit me on the head on different places. sometimes like there's something ""empty"" in my head or missing.feeling like someone had put a metal bar in my head. not migraines. feeling like i do not get enough oxygen. can describe more although it's difficult.

body weakness (not muscles weakness), as in no energy, feeling like i hadn't have sleep for ages (also i was sleeping more than i should), sleepy frequently, having long naps during the day.

superior members (arms etc) mainly feeling weak compared to the legs.

overall feeling very very unwell to the extent to not being able to do normal stuff (shower, etc). symptoms very physical NOT psychological (wasn't feeling sad or having dark thoughts). the head was the most awful thing. not migraines, not headaches. a bit hard to describe.

appetite quite normal.

have done stuff like traveling etc (accompanied with parents), nothing changed during the trip or so.

really awful feelings, daily basis, even when just laying in bed i was feeling them and suffering.

3. i am currently a bit better but really still unwell. i do 10-15% of what i used to do when i was ""normal"" (loved reading, wide cultural knowledge, high grades, practiced some sport etc). i wake up feeling awful and it lasts till the afternoon/evening. after that i am a bit better, slightly. head very very unwell, body unwell, forcing myself to do stuff and act normal. almost 24h/24 (those feelings).

i would like to know your insight on this please, willing to answer any question, thank you so much ! URGENT long term tiredness and very weird symptoms that are stopping me from living , is this depresssion??"

Tonight, I spent the evening with my parents. We laughed for hours. Talked about old memories. Shared memories that we didn’t all know about each other. Even briefly discussed politics without arguing. I realized that even though they’re my parents, I always have something to learn about them and from them. When the night was over, I laid down and realized that I have something to live for. I could never place that hurt on my parents. Tonight, I want to live.

It was the third month of our relationship that everything went down hill. He started calling me names when I told him about my sex addiction that I had gotten out just as we started dating. Name calling. Guilt tripping. Saying he saved me ""from living life as a whore."" He attempted suicide and got put in a mental hospital. I was told it was my fault. I was afraid to talk to him about how much it hurt me. I loved him so much. I kept loving him for months. I loved him until I went insane. He put my life in danger. I finally left on Thursday. I'm still heart broken. There hasn't been a day I haven't cried. He's still finding ways to contact me. I'm being drowned in conflicting thoughts. I miss his hugs and soft back rubs. But I hate the irritation in his voice when I'm in pain. How I screw everything up. It's terrible what he did. I can't breath without him. I'm sinking deeper and deeper and I can't get out. I can't be admitted to the hospital because he did that already. I'd be forced to be around him. I can't escape my thoughts and I can't escape him. I just want my freedom back. I'm sorry this was so rambly but I need to talk to someone. He ruined any friendships I had. I'm so alone. Someone. Help me. My Story."
714,1,"What am I meant to do if my family are skeptical about depression and anxiety? It is so mentally draining when they just laugh or try and convince me it doesnt exist. When i brought home a prescription for depression, they told me not to take it. When i talked to my brother about it, who is one of the only people i feel i can talk to about anything, he just laughed. I just dont know how to deal with it at this point. Any help would be appreciated. Depression"
715,1,"As a child I was very well integrated into society, at school I was the first in the class, I had many friends.  Despite this I began to suffer from depression, nobody in my family cared, it was enough for me to maintain a high academic performance.  Despite the worsening of depression, the onset of generalized anxiety disorder, I maintained a high yield and remained embedded in society.  So I spent 4 years in hell, at the end I stopped doing everything.  I went to the psychiatrist now I take antidepressants and antipsychotics which made me extremely aggressive.  My family frustrates their frustrations by reproaching me as I do pity, maybe to see my reactions.  sometimes I think that if I were an orphan I would be infinitely better and it is so.  I owe nothing to anyone, in this world of dogs, to all people who are in a situation like mine, be hyenas. I have serious mental disorders and my family despises me and laughs about it."
716,1,"I dont have alot of friends, 1 actually.(lets call him alex)
Ive considered him to be my best friend
We have a common group chat and somehow the subject of best friends came up
I said that alex is my best friend
He didnt think the same

Back to being friendless :( Best friend"

718,1,"Kinda don't know how to feel.  
This whole time I've had a feeling it could be depression but always put it on the back burner. I thought I would have a feeling of relief when he told me but I just felt like saying great, something else to worry about. I'm trying to think positive about everything but I feel like I'm just gonna become a burden.  I'm always the guy that tells everyone that if you think positive positive things will happen.  The goofy, trying to make light out of heavy situations Guy. I'm my family's and friends fixer. I'm supposed to fix things not be broken... 
 Anyway, I'm officially depressed. 

Thanks for listening to my rant. I was officially diagnosed yesterday"
719,1,"Found a really good quote in the H3 podcast: “when youre depressed, everyone always says ‘remember to get help’ . . . its a circle jerk for everyone feeling fine.”

its really is just a big ol neurotypical circle jerk! i told my sister about what ive been going through and she told me to get help, and she compared me to a movie villian. i already am getting professional help and i dont like being associated with villians thanks :^ )

if i ask for help, friends will say just say “you need to talk to a professional.” nobody talks about ludicrously expensive sessions per hour and waiting 1+ months before you can even get an appointment. not to mention, ONE PSYCHOLOGICAL APPOINTMENT AINT SHIT, you need to stay with it for weeks or months or years to see results.

and i want to be able to tell people my problems without them thinking of me as a “mental patient.” im just a person and i have problems and sometimes i need to vent them, but ive only met one person who actually listened to me instead of saying “wow that sucks, you need therapy.”

but maybe you should tell me one more time that i “need help” because clearly i havent thought of that before because you know so much more about my situation than i do :^ ) i just love when i open up my heart to someone and they dont give me any of their thoughts besides “you need help” and end the talk at that :^ )

(sorry for getting salty here, im just so sick and tired with dealing with this bullshit. i hardly tell anyone the things i go through anymore because of it) “You need help”"

722,1,"I've been feeling self conscious about my body since I had kids. My stomach got all fucked up because I had large babies. I gained forty pounds over the course of both my pregnancies.
Well I've been clinically depressed for a few years now and about a year and a half ago I decided I was going to lose weight. I did pretty well for a few months and I lost about ten pounds. I was feeling more confident in my appearance although I was still in the pit of depression.
Well I've been feeling worse than normal lately. My dog is dying. She's started having seizures and she barely eats. I know she's nearing the end. I've had her since I was thirteen and I'm in my late twenties. I have been drowning my pain in food. I've gained half the weight I worked so hard to lose and I'm very tempted to just say ""fuck it"" and let myself become obese. I don't have any drive to count calories anymore and I feel hungry all the time. 
I know that gaining bunch of weight is bad for your health but if I'm going to be depressed anyway why should I even try anymore? Why do I even bother trying"
723,1,"A little less than a year ago I attempted suicide. To people who have attempted before, did things get better for you later in life? 

I'm young; I'm 21, I have a little bit of college left and potentially a lot of life ahead of me, but things are still feeling really bleak, and no matter how much I do: exercise, therapy, etc., I'm not feeling much happier. To be honest, I have trouble shaking the thought that I wish my attempt had been successful. Does it get better?"
724,1,Being summer time I am feeling more and more down. I notice that ordinary days off from work I look outside at the sunshine and all I feel is boredom. I have so much apathy and anhedonia but all I can do is stew. Only until night do my negative thoughts subside. It does not feel so bad if the day is gloomy or rainy. Does anyone else feel this way? Any one want to chat? Preferably over 30 and female. Sunshine Depression
725,1,"Why? Because I hate myself. I go through random periods of self-loathing for no reason. I feel like nobody cares even though I know they do. I make a mistake and I beat myself up over it. I feel so insecure about everything and I'm too scared to ask for help. 

And deep down, I kinda like this shit-show. I'm so sad right now"
726,1,"Anyone got any tips on dealing with depression/ how they personally live with it?
Idk what to do anymore but I’m trying kinda Pretty depressed here"
727,1,"I’m utterly in love with a girl I’m pretty close with and I just don’t see it going anywhere. Stack that on top of my clinically diagnosed depression and anxiety issues, and I’ve just been a mess for months. I don’t see any ending to this suffering I’m hurting"
728,1,"On occasion my parents will bring it up.  They’ll ask if I think I’m depressed.  I laugh and mock them for thinking such a crazy thing but of course they’re 100% right.  Obviously I’m not doing a good enough job at hiding it from them.

If I ever find a painless way to make it look like an accident, I would probably jump at the chance.  Pun intended.  But would I actually?  My suicide, even my death in general, would destroy my family.  Siblings and parents both.  They’d all blame themselves, trust me, I know them.  I wish there was some way I could tell them I just don’t want to live.  So that they’d just let me go and focus on raising my siblings instead of me.  Forget about my college payments.  I’m gonna fail out anyways.

I’ve thought hard about this, I’ve run the simulations.  The only timeline in which I get some sort of relief from all this is one where I’m dead.  Because it doesn’t get any better from here on out.  Despite my loving family and supportive friends I will continue to fail at everything I try, I will continue to waste all of my opportunities and time, I will continue to isolate myself, I will continue to embarrass myself, I will continue to hate myself.  It’s just how it’s gonna go.

So that’s really it.  I’m waiting for an out.  I’ve researched suicide options for a long time now and I have yet to find something that conforms to my situational needs.  So I’m stuck here.  Miserable.  I just wanna die.  So that I can relax.  So that I don’t have to keep trying so hard all the time.  It’s not worth it.

I wish I could at least cry.  The most I can do is tear up.  I just want to relax so bad and nobody will let me It feels good to vent here, but I will absolutely never tell anybody in my life about how I feel"
729,1,"Every single fucking day,I wake up in realization that I am still alive,it's been like this for months.And I hate myself,I hate myself because my suicide date has passed long ago.And I am still here.I want to scream,yell and cry.I do something,but this happens so often that I ended up losing some of my sanity.This is making me go crazy.I hate myself for not being able to kill myself. It's something I want to do so bad,but when face to face with the option,I end up passing it up, I don't even know why. And it drives me crazy.It's been months and I am still alive,breathing and all. Heart beating,blood pumping.And I hate it. I almost lost all hope for help.Even though I know it's to late and I'm fucked up.Even though I know my mind is screwed up.


Sorry. I hate myself everyday.(My first post here)"
730,1,"I was brought into this planet as an awkward and overly social person who no girl wants to date and marry, I’m starting to not want friends anymore as all they do is take advantage of each other, I also feel useless as I am not talented in any way shape or form.

731,1,"Sometimes I'll experience stray pockets of solidarity in solitude in the middle of my loneliness and I just feel... still. A strange, eerie placating of the storm in my head, clouds dissipating overhead, sunshine gleaming downwards, bouncing and dancing on the water, and for once I can see all the others. Loneliness can be so stifling, but we're all truly alone, aren't we? What a perplexing paradox...

732,1,"I’m in my last year of college and lately I have been having panic attacks when I go out to a bar with my friends. This is something I used to love to do but now I have to take time to sit by myself and calm down for no apparent reason. I am always able to work through these attacks but sometimes they really scare me. My anxiety has been through the roof lately.  

I have also struggled heavily with depression and self esteem issues. Lately it feels like I just can’t cope with it anymore. Feelings of loneliness and helplessness eat away at me constantly.

The only thing keeping me going is my friends and family. I would rather rot in a dungeon for the next 50 years then have them deal with something happening to me.  I don’t care about myself in the slightest I just want them to be happy. 

I’m looking for advise cause I haven’t been able to sleep well for weeks and nothing seems to help. I need advice on coping with anxiety and depression."

They're even going on their second trip to an exotic island and leaving me home again. I feel so hopeless right now. I even miss school, but Summer break just began. Can someone please just talk to me? I'm crying and I can't sleep, I don't know how much longer I can handle this. I need a friend, my family is against me. I don't care who."

I’m 7 months clean and I hope it can and will continue. Stayed clean for 7 months with the butterfly project"
735,1,"Hi, I've never really posted on here before but wondered if anyone experienced anything similar.

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently started therapy and have noticed the cycles that I get into and how they affect my mood. I know that staying up all night isn't good for me and every night I get myself into a pattern of not sleeping until 6-7am and waking up at like 3/4pm. I get really annoyed at myself for wasting the day and sleeping during the day and it brings me into a circle of having very low mood and feeling hopeless. Whenever I feel low enough, I break out of the cycle and manage to control my sleeping pattern. This lasts for a few days and then I get back in to the cycle of not sleeping at night and wasting my days away which I HATE.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a really bad habit and I want to break it. Any help? My depression always puts me into an awful sleeping pattern cycle?"
736,1,"To start of, I dont have a diagnosed depression, ive never wanted to talk to a doctor about it or anything. I have talked to my mom about it who had a diagnosed depression and she told me I do check all the boxes. Ive had suicidal thoughts off and on for many years among other problems.  Now I have a girlfriend who ive been with for almost 2 years and ive recently opened up to about it. But she kind of brushes it of as me being sad. I really don't like talking about it and making myself look like a sort of victim, but it really hurts me that she doesn't believe me. I was wondering if anybody had any advice about maybe talking to her but without going full out sad boy. Thanks in advance Girlfriend doesn't support"
737,1,"That’s it. I’m just so exhausted in every way imaginable. I just want to lay in bed in the dark all day and every day. It’s getting harder and harder to get up for work every day. Today was really rough. Even when I look at the positives I’m just so tired. I want to scream at the top of my lungs but I don’t have the energy. 

Negative things hit me so hard now and positive things can’t reach me. If someone tells me good job it feels like a lie. If someone was to tell me I fucked something up it would just echo and play in my head all day and I would just keep telling myself I’m a piece of shit and deserve all the pain. 

I’m just so tired. I want to sleep forever. I’m just so tired."
738,1,Im so scared. I’m having a really bad low and I’ve been crying for 20 minutes and none of my friends are responding and I don’t wanna go home and harm myself but idk what else to do to make this pain go away. I tried screaming into my arm but that didn’t help either. help me...
739,1,Title says it all. i want to kms Its taken me an hour to eat a sandwich
740,1,It started March 2019.  I was envious that my boyfriend got a job related to something in the field that I got a master's in but he only has a bachelor's. I was proud of him but mostly envious. Then the next I started feeling bad that I felt that way about him  so I started getting super depressed and since April all I've been doing is going to work and then laying on my couch and not even paying atention to the showes I once enjoyed. I love showes with Fantasy but lately I can't focus. I just get up to eat dinner then fall asleep around 7pm and then wake up at 6am to go to work and start the whole cycle of hating myself again.  My bf said he forgives me and he sees that I'm happy for him but he doesn't know how to help my lack of motivation. I tell him to just let me be. Not even my friends can make me feel better. I've also been dwelling on past mistakes that don't even matter anymore. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel bad that my bf wants to see me happy but I can't. It sucks because I had a vacation with my friends a few weeks ago. I had a lot of fun but after that's all over I just remember going on the plane knowing I'm going back to my depressing life. I honestly have nothing to be sad about. I have a good home life. I have friends that don't so idk what's wrong with me. Do I have Depression?
741,1,"why is it so hard to live.
i can't find interest in anything i do, nothing is fun. i wake up everymorning and i start crying and i can't control it. only thing keeping me alive is that my little brother would be sad and maybe feel the same as i do now.

i just wanna go out for a few drinks, talk to my girlfriend and play video games without having am urge to cry and without zoning out :( why am i like this"
742,1,"Since I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder everything makes sense to me. My extreme mood swings, the way I think of people and the way I act. As my therapist said: I was born with this kind of depression due to my family circumstances.

But I don't want to live like this. Every day, every night I'm constantly thinking. Thinking about everything and always questioning 'what if'. It hurts, it's like a burn in my whole body. 
I hate it and I want to do something against it. Against this feeling. 

I'm very introverted and I'm scared to meet new people but I will fight against this. I don't want to feel bad all the time. I'm so happy that I got so wonderful friends. And I'm so happy that they all want to help me getting out of this hole.

I already made my first steps forward: 
I'm going to the cinema with a friend who lives like 50 km from my home town to watch Spiderman.
I'm going to the outdoor pool with friends who also lives 20 km away from me.
And my best friend and I got the plan to lay back some money so we can visit Japan next year. He lives in another country but I really hope to see him soon. 

I will achieve these things and I will go out of all this pain! I can do it and I thing everyone can try their best to not feel like shit.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day Since I got diagnosed..."
743,1,"It sounds bad but I've always been the smart kid. 

The quiet one in the corner reading.

I'm tired of being miserable. I'm just so tired.

Everyone thinks I'm a dork all the time.

I know some people like to play that role, good for them. But it's just not for me.

Even with other 'dorks' I feel like I'm too 'normal' for them.

Schoolwork ain't my life, that's just all there is.

I've tried accepting who I am. But it never gets better.

I feel like I've been trapped into being someone who I'm not because of a talent.

My parents expect a lot, and I deliver. 

I just wanna fool around, make friends, get grounded a few times like any other kid.

And at the end hear someone say its not the end of the world. How To Be A Teenager?"
744,1,"Why is it that when something slightly bad goes wrong my first reaction is unironically, ""Guess I'll just kill myself""? If I were a normal person I'd take it in stride but move on. But honestly what's the point? All the fears that I ever had of not being good enough, of never 'getting it' even after having the chance to learn, are coming true. I'm useless and worthless. The world would be better off without a fuckup like me and the only reason I'm still here is because like 2 people would be really sad if I ended it. But I just want to end it. I wish I could end it. I fantasize about it. Everything is overwhelming"
745,1,"I have little interest in anything anymore.

I went on a few dates and found that.. nobody interests me.  A few of them were really into me, and I had to let them each down and admit I wasn’t interested.  I thought it’d be a nice distraction to be yearned and wanted, but I found it wasn’t their attention I wanted.  

I often think about how terrible things got so suddenly.. and it makes me spiral out of control.
Everything has made me bitter and angry.  I often think about ending my life to guarantee I’ll never feel this way again.  I keep planning how I’ll do it, and how I’ll write a letter to everyone I’ve ever known and give them my personal last thoughts of them.  

It’s really selfish but the anti depressants are not helping anymore.  I’m still punching walls, my chest is always heavy and on fire, and I can’t help but grimace and hate anything that may come off as romantic.

I can’t stop thinking about those pictures.. those words.. and I feel like dying a little more.  My therapist check in is not coming soon enough Wearing Off"
746,1,"I am 24, graduated 2 years ago. I enrolled for masters program a year ago, but fell out because I couldn't study. I can't study while being insecure, I always think and behave like somebody is going to come through the door any moment. I have had issues with people from my community. I am super anxious around them, like I just freeze and behave childish. I feel like an entertainer, listen to them. Always say something that makes them happy.  
So I have figured, I should leave my home. Probably take scholarship to foreign country. This is how my day goes right now, My sister wakes me up. I drive her to college (the drive takes 35-45 mins home-college-home), About 1 hour later, I drive my brother to his institution. Then I try to sit and study, my sister calls, I pick her up and later my brother with some gap in between. I am totally exhausted. I am not talking physical. I can't stand eyes of so many people and the paranoia that I am jobless driver for my family. I have very low self esteem and get used most of the time. I talk to my family with low voice tone. I never went for diagnosis but I am sure it's scopophobia. It is hard getting past people and walk. If I sit somewhere and am thirsty, I won't stand up and fetch water as it grabs attention. In the earliest of my memories, I remember in 9th grade my teacher stood me up and asked me a question I couldn't understand. I felt awkward and wanted to sit down so badly. My eyes watered as teacher was looking at me.  
 It was religion and studies that kept me going. Highschool was so easy for me that it made me have more faith in God. I honestly believed that I was chosen one or something like that. My dad is an alpha, he never understood my feelings and always wants things to be his way. My mom had issues, his older brother killed himself in 2008. After nana died in 2010 she was very depressed and had to see psychologist. She recovered but she has anger issues. My older bro is a piece of shit. He always got respect by defaming me infront of my relatives. That's one big reason I have anxiety from my relatives. I don't talk to him anymore. My parents always liked him cause he can keep a conversation for an hour. I am shy. I realize now that I didn't say things even when they were right things to say.   
 Everybody thinks it's ""my duty"" to drive my brother/sister. Pick relatives up and drive them to their homes. Fetch this, that, bring things. Look after your 18 year old brother. I don't expect any appreciation, but I need little room of trust and privacy where I can do things for my own. I don't expect any affection or appreciation and also think I can't change them anymore. So I should leave my home for better. I am engaged and my dad wants to arrange marriage next year or the next. I won't marry her in this state. I am in a very bad spot. I would rather quit. I still got a year or 2 to make something of myself. I know this for fact, There will be a time when I won't be able to resist the temptation like I do now. Some more on the background.[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bn8se8/how_do_i_stop_feeling_like_im_60_years_old/)  [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/b8n61p/how_do_i_leave_my_past_behind_and_move_forward/)  I talked to my mother, that something is wrong with me. That I get afraid, She didn't think much of it and thinks I am pulling off drama. Thank you for taking the time to read.  
Edit: forgot the motive of this post lol.. I just need one month or two where I can disappear from this environment, so I can study and earn scholarship. please feel free to ask me anything.

747,1,"I have had the most fucked up year. To the point that I am now questioning how much longer I can take my life doing this to me.

I dont want to go into details... But what broke the camel's back was the horrific ending of a relationship to a person who I love... He hurt me deeply and I retaliated and hurt him back--- I feel like absolute shit. I don't handle guilt well and  I have never found a person who I felt so safe with and know, with confidence, I could tell anything to and not be judged.

He was the first man I felt sexually safe with, too, and never once thought he'd hurt me.... And I know I'll move on and yada yada it gets better and all that bullshit.... But right now all I want is to be held by him and told my life isn't a black hole of pain and misery.

Obviously I'm leaving him the fuck alone... But it doesn't change how I feel... 
You guys, I'm bawling my eyes out trying to handle feeling completely numb and hurting more than I ever have before.... I lost my best friend and my love, and feeling his absence is like a hole.  

I think the worst is that I always forgive everyone. I try to talk with them and understand, and hopefully forgive.... And I was willing to be there and help him through this rough patch in his life--- and I get none of that back. From anyone. Ever. The 4th isn't making it easier. I can't hardly breathe most days from how tight my chest is after all of this.... My brother made me realize how shitty my childhood was, how much I've blocked out, and how absolutely fucked up I am... Or at least how I feel... And it sucks because I want so badly to be accepted for my mistakes and it feels like I never will.

I don't know. I'm just venting and don't know how to express all of this... I just want this constant hurt to stop. I want to feel something other than hurt or numb. I took the 4th of July weekend off because of how much it fucks with me. I don't want advice, I just need to say this to anyone"

My girlfriend got paid yesterday. Having read my last post about boredom and impatience, she offered to take me out for dinner and I pay half of it back to her when I receive my first pay in a couple of days.

Made my month! We had a gorgeous time out, a date night. So wonderful just to get out of the house and share some quality time together. 

By the time we got out it was getting late so we didn’t exactly have the choice of the most stunning places to eat; but we found a cosy spot. We had some drinks, ate some Mexican, talked about interesting things, went home, smoked some weed, had a really great dirty fuck, then snuggled together before falling asleep. Made me so happy! Today I’m walking on springs!

I’m a disappointment to my father, and that is maybe the hardest thing for me. The shame that eats away at me constantly somedays is almost crippling. I’m not proud to admit but I did have a slight breakdown a few days ago which left me a sniveling sack of shit on my bedroom floor. I was just thinking about what to do that day and then I just fell off my bed and curled up on the ground. I felt pathetic, but i suppose its just because I am.

I had a job for four years, lost it three months ago because I just thought I was above the rules I guess. I was fed up with my job (which was a manager at pizza hut) and started drinking at work. Then I’d drive home shitfaced going over 100mph. I liked the thrill of it, but thinking it over I know there was a few nights I was half hoping I’d be a second to late on something and just fly off the highway. Ahhh the good days. I’ve been struggling to find a job since but I know my resume is just half a joke, and I don’t have a linkedin or anything like that. I’ve dumped all my social media since then besides reddit, but I never used it before all this. I’ve kinda started to like reddit (as impossible as that sounds) because in a sad way, I guess it makes me feel less alone about it all, which I know is horrible. I don’t gain any satisfaction reading peoples turmoils, I genuinely wish I could help... but as I remind myself all to often “How can you help anyone when you can’t even help yourself?”

But I do want to help myself, it has just been hard to figure myself out. Since I was rejected by the military (on the account I have a disease I didn’t even know about until they told me) I just shit down. I stopped caring about everything. I went i to a deep mental state of depression, but I didn’t call it that. I preferred to call it “being apathetic” same thing though. I retreated into video games to find solace, but as the years went by they all got so boring until recently i just uninstalled everything. I let my dreams die with my emotional state until I almost convinced myself I wasn’t even a real person, but just a shadow that could walk and move on its own. I tried so hard to detach from my problems, but we all know the harder you run, the harder it hounds you.

I want to get my life straight, and I don’t care what it takes. But I’m as unmotivated as I am determined. I can’t seem to give myself a break, but my life (filled with as much inner turmoil as it is) isn’t bad. I just don’t know what I want for myself. 

Sorry for anyone who read through tiresome rant. I can’t bring myself to say these things aloud. Mixed in with the fact I actively push people away of fearing being to close to people. I don’t know, I’m just an mental wreck but I cover it up well lol. I’m trying therapy, but no one knows it, I just lie and tell my dad I’m going to work or the gym (on that note i havnt been to the gym in months and it shows T-T) but maybe once I bring myself to face my problems, I can move past them... but its so fucking hard sometimes I really hate myself and I’m trying not to"
753,1,"Bf and I just got back from a long trip together. It went pretty well and we got along well, so major issues or arguments. After coming home I’ve sunken into really bad depression because of some financial issues with my house and I am feeling really off about my relationship. At the moment, I don’t really feel anything for him. Although I want to feel positive and loving towards him I really just feel numb. I don’t really feel love or attraction towards him and I don’t really have the desire to see him... Deep down I know he means the world to me and is the person I want to be with but I’m stuck. What can I do about this? I see a counselor and DO NOT take medication because I haven’t been able to find any that have worked for me. Depression making me feel numb in my relationship?"
754,1,"my anxiety forced my significant other to take a break from me for two weeks. i haven't seen their face, and nothing aside from one good night text 24 hours ago. 

no matter how hard i try to go out and devote my time to doing something or spending time with other people, i feel absolute loneliness. it's been almost 8 years and no matter how hard i try to be optimistic, i feel like i end up deeper than where i started.

i've arranged to meet a therapist but i feel like even then it won't help. i feel like i'm blindly stumbling in the dark. 

has anyone attended therapy, and has it worked out at all for them? does it get better?"
755,1,"*A very long rant and unorganized. Sorry.*

My parents are homophobic, racist, hypocrites, and extremely closed minded. They don't understand that depression is a disease that anyone can have, even if they have everything anyone could ever want. They laugh at other people who have depression because they think depression is a joke. They think everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community is insane, mentally ill, and evil. They sneer at the homeless. Even when I try to show them how insensitive they are being, they don't listen to me. 

I, unfortunately, am everything they seem to hate. I'm depressed. I'm pansexual. And if I ever come out of the closet, I will be kicked out of the house and left to die on the streets. 

However, I've been staying quiet. They occasionally comment on how I'm still a failure, even though I try my hardest to impress them. Even though I try to smile more; even though I try not to have a crush with another cute person, regardless of whatever gender they are, I can't help it. Sooner or later, they're going to find out. I'm going to be kicked out to the streets and become another statistic. 

Even though I hate my parents... I still love them. They still care for me, even though they only care for the person I pretend to be. They give me food, water and a roof above my head... Yet even though they would hate the real me, I still can't hate them back. They've sacrificed their well-being for me... shouldn't I be able to sacrifice my happiness for theirs?

I would never wish them to be ill. I want them to live a long and happy life. In the end, they want me to live a perfect life that they never could have. 

I can't be the perfect daughter they wanted, and I feel awful because of that. I feel like a constant disappointment, and they remind me that I'm not good enough. I can no longer list a single positive trait about myself. I'm fat. I'm ugly. I'm stupid. I have no talent. I'm not special. I'm just a mistake. 

In the end, I'll have to tell them. They're going to be disappointed in me and themselves for raising me better into the perfect child they have always dreamed of. In the end, I'm most likely going to see the last of my days on the streets, just how the statistics forecast. 

But as for today, I will stay quiet. Tomorrow, I will wish I was different. The day after that, I will hate myself for thinking that I'm suffering more than anyone else. The cycle will continue until the tire runs flat. But by then, no one will care or remember me. By then... it will all be over. By then... will I ever be accepted and truly be happy? I hate my parents, but I love them at the same time."
756,1,"I just graduated high school (though just barely, these last few months have been hell) and I'm going to the beach soon; AKA I have significantly fewer problems and stuff to look forward to, but I still want to die. I can't even cut anymore to feel something because my parents would see and throw me back in inpatient. I just feel so fucking numb b/c of the antidepressants and my psych just upped my dosage to the max))))))

I just want to fucking scream and cry and just... die. I cant stop thinking of killing myself, slitting my wrists and bleeding out. It feels like all I'm doing at this point is trying to distract myself from the bad thoughts™. It's not getting any better and I'm scared to tell anyone for fear of being sent back to the psych ward. I just feel so fucking confused and frustrated and I don't know what the fuck to do. Is this what the rest of my life is going to be like? Might as well off myself now if so...

758,1,"I wrote the below poem in 20mins at 3am one morning while at work. It helped me to finally realize that I needed some help with the situation that I was and still am in. 

When a darkness falls,
When all seems lost,
When the fear of the unknown calls,
What will be the final cost ?

When, a ray of hope,
you finally see.
You grasp at it,
but it is not to be.

When, you had it all,
At the start,
Why and how you ask,
did it all fall apart?

When your life
appears to be in trouble,
All problems, big and small,
seem to double.

When finally you think
it can’t get worse,
It feels as if life itself;
is the curse.

When given a pill,
it’s hard to swallow,
For it’s in self doubt, pity &amp; guilt,
That your mind does wallow.

When you think about
what might have been,
Where happiness once was,
Now only emptiness can be seen.

When emotions run wild,
deep in your heart,
Despair begins,
Dark and Dangerous thoughts start.

When drugs and or loneliness,
become your only friend,
Your silent wish is
for it all to end.

When all you seek
an end to your pain,
You don’t care;
if a child’s horrific loss, is your gain.

When at its deepest and darkest,
it all becomes too much,
It’s too late you feel,
for that loving human touch.

When you are in that hole
and you want it to end,
all you need to do is
Say Hi to a friend. When A Darkness Falls"

761,1,"Everyday when I go to bed I think ""I'm going to change, I'm going to start taking care of myself, and I'm going to stop the cigarettes and alcohol and drugs, and I'll focus on the things I feel that I like, and will progress as a human being.""

It's the same everyday, and nothing ever changes. I still smoke first thing in the day, still drink as soon as I'm out of my tedious tiresome job that I probably just work so I can feed my vices, still drug myself to sleep everyday because I literally can't sleep if I'm not high.

I'm tired of fighting myself, specially because it's been about 8 years of that. It's too hard to keep spirits up everyday. I feel like I go to sleep decided to change and just fail the next day and so on."
762,1,"I can’t keep living the way I am. I deflected people away from me so long. I lived a dozen lies in front of different people. For so long I’ve refused to be honest and real with anybody. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve pushed away or lied about serious problems in my life. Before high school I had never lived in a place more than 3 years. I was never made to be able to handle long relationships. I’ve never developed anything stronger than “nice friend” with anybody. For so long I was so distant with everyone, that I lost track of who I really am. I found him again, and I don’t want to be him anymore. I want to be something else. I want him to go away. I hate who I am so much. I have false confidence until it really counts. I shy away from making real conversations. Handling my situations head-on. I refused to talk to my hockey coach about quitting today. I couldn’t do it. I can’t cry it out anymore, I’ve tried. All I can do is tear up, nothing comes out. I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried committing suicide before, but I can’t even try that without backing out of it. I wish someone else were born in my situation. Whatever characteristics make an individual, I wish I didn’t have them. I wish I were  different. That I could stick to things, and commit. That I could form strong bonds with people for a long time. That I had skills besides useless fucking surface level knowledge. I don’t want to be here anymore. I can’t sink where I was before. And the worst part is I can’t fucking tell anyone. I’ve tried, I always hold myself back. I just can’t do it. I hope something takes me. That I randomly suffer a debilitating occurrence that will absolve me of all my responsibilities. I can’t take this anymore. My last freedoms of childhood are slipping away and I sit doing nothing to slow it. For months I wondered when things would fall apart for me as my mind toyed with me, worse than years before. It’s finally here. I don’t want to be me anymore."
763,1,"The worst part about being depressed for me isn’t the actual feeling. It’s getting there. The little things you notice when you’re going down again. Not showering, brushing your teeth, ignoring people. It sucks. I feel like there’s nothing I can do about it. Even worse than that, I’ve lost joy in everything that once made me happy, so I can’t do anything myself to fix it. The worst thing about it"
764,1,"Its like...everyday you wake up, it hurts so much. Your mind tells you ur gunna end up killing yourself. And then, one day...who knows you may end up dead.
I think about how I'm gunna commit suicide. Thinking if I should take it out like Amanda Todd, or Hannah Baker. I imagine walking threw a beautiful forest where the trees and grass are pure green. There are bees and butterflies passing by me. Birds chirping chancing each other, flowers on the grass, deers, bunnys, and a waterfall. I take out a razor blade out of my pocket and head to the waterfall pond. I lift my arm up and cut it on the blue line looking to hit an artery. And do the same with the other arm. I imagine floating there, watching the water turn red, and hear the beautiful sounds around me. And peacefully die. 
I'm SAD every single minute of the day. 
I hate myself. People ask why I'm like this...
I say because of me. I make myself SAD, 
It's my brain, it's my arms, thighs and thoughts. 
SAD...Suicidal And Depressed.

766,1,"So I went to my bi-yearly appointment w the dentist and got my teeth cleaned.  I haven’t gotten a single complaint about the state of my teeth since I first started going... until this appointment.  In the past 6 months I’ve really let my dental hygiene slip away from me, only brushing in the morning (if I get up at all), not flossing, etc.  Really I’ve just let myself waste away in my bed, making myself look presentable for the day and then passing out the second I got home from school or other activities.  So today at the dentist the woman commented on how much plaque I have on my teeth and I almost lost all composure.  I obv didn’t want to give this poor lady any unnecessarily personal info, but I was absolutely mortified and ashamed.  I’m trying my best, truly, and I hate feeling like a worthless slob, but I know it isn’t enough and I have no explanation other than my brain being a dick. How to talk to dental hygienists??"
767,1,"Listen, this isn’t so bad, I just need to rant.  I know other people have it worse, its just I thought I finally defeat my depression until now.

I was doing better for months until I had a series of unfortunate things I mostly caused happen all at once.

I moved out at my parents house, i miss having someone close to talk to and who are actually happy to see me.  I only know one of my roommates well enough to somewhat talk to about deep stuff bothering me, and even him it goes in one ear, out the other.

My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me, but I need to get back to that.

My drug habit has gotten to the point I’ve lost my sense of who I am.  For a month now, I haven’t spent a day sober, I’ve tried, but by the end of the night I somehow have gotten hold of either cocaine or percocets.  I don’t even remember how I get them, theyre just there in front of me crushed up, about to go into my nose.  My roommates think I’m a degenerate, and I don’t blame them, thats all they’ve seen my do since I moved it.  

Now back to this ex.  I dated her for 3 years, she was the girl I had always dreamed of.  Loved indie music, an artist, short, goofy, but deep thoughts, amazing sex and open to what I liked.  I did everything for her, I stuck with her even after only seeing her 3 times in 3 months due to an eating disorder.  I gave her a place to stay after her dad disappeared for 3 days threatening suicide, I bought her and her brother food whenever.  

But then things changed within a few months, she told me it was just stress and I gave her the benefit of the doubt even though she wouldn’t even try to be intimate with me like she used to.  But the day I moved out, she decided to tell me she had lost sexual attraction for me, and left.  I tried telling her its a common thing in long relationships (right?) and we can work on it.  She wouldn’t budge.  Yesterday her friend sent me proof she had been talking to this guy and sending him nudes pretty much a few days after we broke up.  I knew the dude, I called her out for having a snapchat streak with him before since she would of gotten mad if I had one with a girl and she told me it was just a friend she met in class.  I had my doubts but I trusted her. 

But now she sends him everything I had ever wanted and had to work for forever.  It doesn’t bother me she moved on, I get it, it happens.  Its that I believed her was someone uglier than me, and now my self confidence has taken a huge drop.  

On top of all this I realized I hate every moment of my job, but it is the only way I can afford rent. 

TL:DR- I’m hanging on by a thread.  I’ve dug myself into such a deep hole and won’t take advice from anybody.  I hate my job and standing alone in there for 5 hours drives me insane,  I’ve lost all interest in any hobbies, I haven’t been sober for a month since I’ve moved out, my ex had been flirting with a guy after 3 years of me putting everything in.  I won’t talk to anyone, and each day I lose my sanity one by one. All came crashing down at once"
768,1,"and it's somehow working.

But one day it won't be anymore, and the fact that that day is approaching is a sign that I'm slowly losing the fight. Blasting music in my headphones to distract myself from the painful desire to kill myself"
769,1,"I've been depressed for the last 6 years and at some point being sad and depressed actually felt more calm and comforting than being happy, at this point being happy just feels so fake, like if I'm happy I'm just lying to myself Does your depression get comforting after a while?"
770,1,"I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel extremely depressed and i don’t really talk to anyone, don’t really have any friends left. Every single day I wake up then deep clean one of the rooms (it is already surprising that i’m able to do that), watch something on Youtube and go to sleep. I have this type of routine for a couple of weeks now. And I’m fine with that.
The problem is that I started to face some extreme anger for no real reason. All my life I had some anger management issues but not to such violent extent. I mean... I get angry and agressive from 0 to 100. I’m starting to feel like I’m either going to hurt someone else or myself for no reason. I don’t know what to do... Can’t control my anger anymore"
771,1,Let me give you a little backstory on who I am. I am generally a very social person and not one to sit alone or by myself. But recently I have kind of been drifting towards that. Earlier this year I was diagnosed with sever depression and admitted to a psych ward for treatment. I was willing to work with them as I wanted to get better but their program didn't fit me. They were teaching how to control your emotions when I feel like I don't have many and can control mine easily. I'm starting to have these pent up outbursts of emotion/depression that just makes me want to end it. Not to stop pain or because my life is trash. It's because i get worried about my future and if the greatest rest of them all could help lift it off my chest. This is just kind of a rant. I needed to put this somewhere. Sorry I want help.
772,1,"yesterday i just broke down crying. like, it genuinely surprised me because it came out of nowhere. i cried for like fifteen minutes and just felt really numb for hours.

it's 11:00am now and i can feel it happening again. i feel so fucking alone i don't know what to do i can feel myself getting worse"
773,1,"I honestly thought I was getting better, beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But my mother is the reason why I have started to feel anxious, worthless and depressed again. 

She places so much pressure on me to be perfect and is obsessed with weight (even though all doctors say I’m healthy and my weight is normal) always telling me off for not doing a lot of exercise and eating “too” much. 

I have spoken to her about my depression but she thinks I’m bluffing. I really don’t want to kill myself at all but every time she tells me that I’m getting fat and that I’m lazy I just can’t help but think about suicide. My mother just makes everything worse"
774,1,"Sorry if this whole post is unformatted, shitty, and badly typed. Just not enough emotional energy to even try. All the things normal people would be so happy to have going on in their life, make me hate everything more. I have a two-month-old son and got engaged in February. I am already previously diagnosed with schizophrenia, and majorly struggling. Honestly, the joy out of both events was quickly taken away. Not trying to seem ungrateful, but my fiance has one child already and his family threw a huge party for them, and when his niece was born a year ago, she was greeted with everything she would ever need by his family. When it came to my son, none of his family cares to help us get anything. My fiance bought him a playpen and a few other things. (All of which went back to Wal-Mart for money for food) He is going on 3 months old and his family (in my opinion) would rather spend all their money on his first child and just usees mine as a show for social media. I have been promised him a swing since right after his birth by both sides of his and my family, and everyone just ignores him. I already feel like a loser because no one cared enough to even celebrate his birth, and I am struggling to get SSI because my social anxiety and depression make it hard for the social interaction necessary for work. We live with his parents, but every month we are met with the same ""Don't worry about a job, we are moving this month"" but never move, I've been hearing that for over 6 months. Also, when I manage to beg 20-30 dollars from my mother for something for my son, his mother makes me use it for household purposes (which isn't a big deal) or supporting her smoking habit, but when I ask for something in return I get told how she owes me nothing and that I owe her rent. When I got engaged, my fiances first baby mama threw a huge fit so everyone comforted her and basically told me it was fucked up that he proposed. Of course, I feel like shit for even getting engaged. Now his mother is starting to get involved in our fights, (siding with her son, obviously) and it's honestly exhausting. I love my fiance and two children, but the longing for suicide just drives me so hard. I Hate Myself."
775,1,"I started working for a really good company last year. After 15 months, I was promoted today to the next position up. And I the crazy thing was I signed the new plan... And nothing.

I felt absolutely nothing. I've been sad and distraught and having a hard time about a lot of things. I thought progression in my career, the considerable increase in my financial capacity, or the aura of accomplishment would make me feel something. Maybe not better but something. And I feel nothing.

I thanked my bosses for the upward movement and the opportunity. I texted some close friends. I called my parents and my siblings. And they were all so excited like it was a big deal. And I just couldn't match.

I tried to go out and celebrate. I went out for dinner and treated myself. Had a glass of champagne. Nothing. Went to a bar to talk to people and had a shot with a stranger to try to escape the loneliness of having no friends around me. Nothing. No matter what I did, I just couldn't feel anything but emptiness. 

So I came home and sank myself into videogames for 6 hours. I got up to use the bathroom once. And that was the only other thing I did in that time. All the while I thought, this is supposed to be a monumental moment. A feeling of elation, relief, gravitas. And all I could feel was empty and like nothing has changed.

I don't remember what it's like to feel happy. Like truly happy about something. I vaguely remember feeling sad, but this isn't it. I just feel so indifferent, and really, that's the worst feeling I've ever had. When there's no highs or lows in my life anymore. Everything just happens. What a pathetic experience. Got promoted today..."
776,1,"I can't help but blame myself. I mean I have no one to blame but myself. I have this feeling that I can't shake. It drags me down, it holds me back. I feel like I am not myself. I've felt so lost for so long and for the first time in a long time I can see a healthy path that I want to take. But I don't even leave the house. I can't start that path if I don't follow it. I feel as if all the good things in my life are disappearing. I just lost a job that I loved and I might lose this guy I've been seeing. I can't help but feel like me and my energy are pushing these things away. I don't know where all my friends went either. I tried talking to a friend today to feel better but they flaked. This damn feeling is deep in my chest. It makes it hard to breathe. I try to ignore it and now that my Wellbutrin dosage was bumped up it makes it easier to ignore, but it is still always there. It like when you bring your attention to how you breathe. Once you think about it you can't stop almost as if you were to stop you'd stop breathing. When I bring my attention to this feeling, it swallows my chest and falls to the pit of my stomach. It makes me sick and nauseous, I even nearly pass out. It begins to bring bad thoughts that make me feel scared, sad, angry, pathetic. But the kind of scared that you feel deep in your stomach. It's a terrible feeling I can't shake. 

I just want to be healthy and happy. I'm ruining my life. (rant)"
777,1,"My face is thin, scarred up, my features are uneven, I have dark bags under my eyes. It's even worse, since my appearance is something I can't change I look dead"
778,1,"I have a lot of shit I need to get out, I have never told anyone any of this stuff, and I probably never will, if i don't get it out somehow its gonna kill me so I'm just gonna write it down. If you decide to read it sorry cause its kinda a jumbled mess in no specific order. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am 1 of 3 children I have never stood out my mom likes my sister best and my father likes my brother best (although they would never say it, its fairly obvious), and then that leaves me just the odd one out. I'm treated just fine which is why I hate that i feel so shitty, like why can't I just be happy with what I have. I think the real issue I have here is that my life has no positive effects on them i'm sure they would be ""sad"" if i died, but honestly I can't think of one single bad thing that would happen, but the lists of benefits goes on and on. It's weird that suicide was ever on my my mind in the first place, but its just a normal thought at this point, and i'm ashamed to say I think about it almost daily.

A few years ago I lost my grandparents (its kinda complicated but they aren't dead however they might as well be), when I did I never cried about it, not once. I was very close with my grandma, to the point that I basically lived at her house and now I haven't seen her in almost 4 years, i didn't even have the chance to say goodbye, and yet I never cried and I find it hard to even feel sad about it. This is the main reason I think there is something seriously wrong with me, because I remember being a kid and when kids said their grandparents died I got scared just thinking what if my grandma did, and yet now that she is it really hasn't effected me at all. 

Last year my dog died, and this is the dog I had since I was in kindergarten, I would sleep with her every night, and the same thing happened when she died I didn't feel sad, and I didn't cry. I remember seeing every other member of my family cry or act sad in some way, but not me I just kept going same as always.

Everything from my speech to my movements are weird, its almost as if i'm a different species and I know others can see it too. Sometimes I feel like everyone knows to avoid me before they ever see me. The worst part is I wasn't always like this, I can remember early elementary school being a normal happy kid.

I'm in college and yet I have never had a girlfriend, and I feel that hurts most of all, I try to forget about it, but no matter how hard I try I cant. I guess you could call me a hopeless romantic, but I feel like thats a generous term I feel more like a creep cause anytime I get any sort of attention from a girl I ""fall in love"", this has lead to me being a sad and desperate person. I see kids half my damn age talking about their ex girlfriend and I cant take it I feel like such a loser. I also hate it when people say ""why are you so worried you will find someone eventually"", its like no you don't understand some people just don't. I don't know why I want a girlfriend so bad, but when it gets really bad I tell myself there is a person out there waiting for me and if I die then she will be left alone so I have to live for her sake (i know its dumb, but you know it is what it is). 

When I started college I was happy i thought I can finally get away from the person I once was, these people don't know who I am, and I can be better, not act like such a weirdo. For the first semester or so i felt good but now its all coming back and its hitting harder than ever, I just hate, like why the fuck cant I blend in I don't get it  I feel like i'm marked and I will forever be this way no matter what I do or where I go. 

In college the parties were fun but at one I got really drunk and I woke up with a huge scar on my arm. I just wore a hoodie for about a month (there is still a faded mark but its basically gone now) no one noticed I assume its because they just didn't care enough to notice, and why would they care about someone who doesn't even care about himself.

I recently got really into weed it was nice it kind of made me forget everything, and i know that people say don't use drugs to cope, but honestly its better than the alternative. 

I find my very existence is contradictory I wanna be unique but I wanna fit in, I want people to stop pitying me but I keep giving them reasons to. Its like there is a war to decide every decision I make and every time I feel like I made the wrong one. I don't want people to know how shitty I feel, but I always allude to it, weather it is in my musical choice or the expressions I make, or the fact that I flat out tell them i'm depressed when i'm drunk, but they never do anything, I assume they just don't care but honestly what do I want them to do?

I have this wish that one day I can go back in time and do it all again, or maybe that this was all a dream and I don't actually have to be me. I don't know what is the point of hoping for that though its like hoping ever did anything, if it did I wouldn't be like this because I pray and wish everyday somehow that I can be better, but it never happens because I don't really put in the effort I say I am unable to and I know that is just a lie I can I just chose not to and I hate that, why am I just sitting here typing a damn essay about how depressed I am instead of doing something about it, maybe its because everything I try just fails.

I have been depressed for years now, and I always told myself I was just making it up, so I never told anyone. Now I feel so alone I lie on a daily basis (for a variety of reasons), which is why now I feel like no body knows or understands me, but how could I expect them to. 

I know I am my own worst enemy and I cause all these problems, there have been periods where I don't even leave my room, not even because I don't want to because I have no where to go, I used to put in the effort I would just walk in a circles just to not feel like I was locked in a prison in my own room but it really just made it worse I always felt like people saw that I had no where to go and were judging me.

All in all I really only feel shitty when it comes to myself I'm starting to realize I don't care about others and I know its fucked up but I cant control it. I ask myself sometimes why I don't just kill myself, and if i'm gonna be honest, I don't know a lot of times I just find dumb little excuses not to (like I mentioned before), none of them are actually good enough for me to live for, so why do I keep living I really don't know. I think if i died tomorrow would I wish I was alive and the truth is i couldn't say I feel no real attachment to this world, but if that was true I probably would have killed myself by now.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot more, but I doubt anyone really cares and at this point i'm just rambling about nothing and probably just spreading negative thoughts to others who are struggling. Why can't I just kill myself?"
779,1,"For a while now I've felt my depression worsen. I did what is considered ""right"" -- I visited my doctor for meds, he referred me to a psychiatrist, we met and talked and I got further instructions.

I try to exercise, eat healthy, take care of my hygiene, despite my lack of motivation for everything.

I've been antisocial lately because I've had nothing to say. I used to be known as a chatterbox and the life of the party, whereas now I dread leaving my house.

After feeling too much loneliness, I attempted to reach out to my friends and lightly tell them I feel lonely, and every person LITERALLY responded with a sad face. "" :(""

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dealing with suicidal ideation for a while now, and I've TRIED to do all the ""right things"", and even reaching out to my friends, and I'm so alone. My life feels worthless. My birthday is actually coming up in 6 days and while I hate it and try not to acknowledge it, I know I'll be spending it alone. It's impossible not to feel suicidal. I don't know what to do anymore because I really have tried to do everything to help myself and it seems that with all my trying its pointless.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm jaded to say the least, I'm sorry I'm rambling for no reason. It's getting exhausting."
780,1,"Back story: depression and anxiety for years, recent events caused me to relapse after doing really well and I’m back at rock bottom again 

I’m willing myself to just get up and go to work and slap on a brave face every day. 

Try not to let your family or coworkers know you’re feeling like you want to die.

Cause it’s awkward as fuck. 

I go to work and I have no motivation. I feel like a stupid idiot, making mistakes, staring into space. Just generally not even present.

I come home, holding back tears, wanting to constantly sleep and have no interest in doing anything whatsoever that used to make me feel okay. 

How much longer can we live like this? 

The pretence is fucking exhausting. How am I supposed to live with this?"
781,1,"I would not know where to start but I'm constantly in my mind thinking too many things one after the other, I never feel silence, besides feeling that whatever I do things have no meaning or meaning to which I can link
I tried to study a career for two years in the capital of my country and for many reasons I had to go back to my family and leave, I have been practically half a year without seeing friendships or having external motivations more than washing dishes or household things
I feel oppressed by my own form, what does it make me think so much if I feel so alone and useless and so uprooted ????
all the time I regret in addition to having discussed or removed friends and couples for different reasons, I feel that I do not serve to change and little by little I am getting older and lonelier
I also can not trust my family very much, when I remember that they hurt me directly or indirectly I just feel violent feelings or distrust too strong
I do not know, maybe I should ask for more medication or try to exhaust myself every day but seeing normal people makes my head compare and distrust a lot, I think I'm too traumatized, maybe I should go inside until my mind is ordered Why did i cry everytime i miss someone"
782,1,"I think that when I was really young, about seven to ten years old, I was sexually assaulted by someone who used to be a friend of mine.  I am going to call her Olivia (not her real name).  We have not talked in years.

So, like Olivia, I am female and we are also the same age.  I did not know anything about the LGBTQ+ community.   
However, I now recognize myself as bisexual and I have had relationships with both guys and girls.  My parents don't support the LGBTQ+ community, however, especially my mom, who says a lot of negative things about the community.  She does not like gay people and she calls trans people things like ""its"", etc.  I feel like my family would not support me if I were to tell them that I am bisexual.

Looking back, I think that Olivia may have liked me or something.  I don't know how I felt about her though, she was a friend to me.

Anyway, Olivia took all of her clothes off and she made me get undressed too.  I was at her house the first time that she got on top of me and started to kiss me and all that, I didn't know what was going on and I don't remember what I did.   
We were not girlfriends or anything though and this continued.  A few years later, I was ten and Olivia went into my room and started to take her top off and stuff.  I was not comfortable with that.  She told me to take my top off, and I said no, but she said that since she did so, I do too.  So I did.  Olivia wanted me to kiss her but I said no and made an excuse not to but we kissed anyway.  Olivia started to talk at school during lunch about this stuff when other people were around, which was really awkward and made me even more uncomfortable because it was not funny and it was really personal.

We were never together or anything.  I do sometimes just randomly think about it.  Doesn't matter where I am.  It has definitely effected the way that I think about sex though.  I'm not asexual or anything, I do get turned on and I do want to have sex.  But after a short period of time of watching pornography, I stop and regret it.  Like, as if it is wrong or something.  I've never really told anyone about this except my boyfriend and my ex.  I am scared to seek proper help about the it though because it happened so long ago, even though it does still effect me. 

I know that this probably is not serious as I think it is, and I'm just a dumb teenager overreacting or something, which is why I want other peoples' opinion on my experience.  I feel that my experience is probably insignificant compared to others, because other peoples' stories involve things that are worse than just unwanted nudity and kissing, like rape and stuff.  Other people have had worse problems than me. 

I've had other experiences with girls my age that made me uncomfortable like this too.  Not too long ago, I went to Disney for a band field trip and this one girl was making me really uncomfortable.  She knew that I am bisexual and that I have a boyfriend, but she would not stop telling me to break up with my boyfriend and to be with her instead.  I said no and told her to stop.  She kept asking me, and I said no.  I told my ex (who is also in band and is still a really good friend of mine) about her.  

I didn't tell my boyfriend about her though.  To be honest, I do feel closer with my ex than my boyfriend.  My ex knows that I have a boyfriend, but we still talk about certain things.  I might still have feelings for my ex.  I was the one who broke up with him and I don't even know why.  I really, really miss him, but I also really, really doubt that he still has feelings for me.  My boyfriend never talks to me and he always says that he is busy.  

A couple years ago, I cut myself and my mom noticed and she just thought that I was doing it because other people were doing it or something.  She doesn't know anything.  I didn't have it in me to talk to her about it though, I didn't want to make things worse or to make her sad.  

I feel really lonely.  And sometimes I feel suicidal too.  

I don't think I have it in me to actually be brave enough to end it all though. I need help and I don't know what to do to make any of this better."
783,1,"I always get this feeling that I call the kernel. Its the best way I can think of to describe it. When Im feeling okay and having a good time, sometimes I can feel the kernel being planted in the very back of my head. I still feel okay, but I have this overwhelming sense of dread, anxiety, panic, sadness, nausea, everything. Its like I feel okay but I know that a wave of dread is about to completely crash over me and it makes me freak out. Its one of those feelings where you want to lie down and cry but even if you did the tears wouldnt come out. It happens at completely random times and it gives me major anxiety because I am just waiting for it all to hit me. Sometimes it does, and other times it goes away after some time and I wonder why I was even feeling that way to begin with. I think it often has to do with my substance abuse and being an overly nostalgic person. The kernel in the very back of my head is telling me to move backwards rather than forwards. To indulge in my past experiences like my old video games, tv shows, daily activities. It keeps me stuck in a recurring cycle of doing the same thing over and over. Its like being happy and reminiscing makes me sad rather than happy and when I am happy the kernel reminds me that I am actually depressed, and my mood changes in an instant. Ive read a lot about how the human mind filters out bad things in the past to remember all the good, but I honestly dont think I had bad things happen to me when I was younger. I was just overall a happier person without the realization that there was nothing ahead of me. I actually do have aspirations and dreams of the future but it feels like they are unobtainable and I would rather cry and even die than actually pursue anything important. At this point I am just tipsy and rambling but I just wanted to know if anybody else feels the experience of this “kernel”. 

TL/DR: There is a kernel in the very back of the head that reminds you that you are about to be hit by fear, sadness, and anxiety but there is no way to tell when its going to hit. Its like you want to rip it out of your brain. 

Just a college student rambling with the knowledge that nothing lies beyond graduation

EDIT: Nostalgia is one of my favorite phenomena, but it ruins my life because it makes me so sad. I block out my past so I can live in the moment and  maintain sanity The Kernel/Seed"
784,1,"So for a few years, i've had issues opening up to people in person. Whenever someone asks me whats wrong or asks about depression, or just general mental health I always respond the same unless i'm backed into a corner. I just smile and say that i'm fine, even if someone is shouting as me or saying that they know i'm not fine I just keep doing the same thing. A few times i've been backed into a corner and been forced to make up some reason or give a semi-real reason that i'm not fine. When i'm talking to someone over the internet or text I can pour my heart out cause I know that person can't hurt me or anything. But in person I just smile and keep repeating the same phrase over and over and depression sorta makes me go into a numb mode where before I was trembling with fear that they know whats going on I just sorta shut down and feel numb and as I said, just repeat the same phrase. I don't know why I do this and even to this very day no one IRL even knows whats going on with me at all since I can fake being fine very well.  Any thoughts? Unable to open up to people in person?"
785,1,"Hey, Sorry for my grammar but it's just been like that.  I'm only here because I don't know what to do and I don't know if this is normal but I would cry at least twice in just two weeks.  Anyways here is my story. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father, a hard working man that has troubling issues with his anger.  I remember him getting angry at me using my phone while it's charging I was demoralized after that.  He always tried to make him as his so-called ""loving father"" but he would only care about how the things we're doing not our emotions.  I feel like he thinks we have a strong character, in reality, he was the only one who destroyed it.  Whenever we fight and I know I'm in the right I would just say ""Yes daddy"" (We are forced to call him that)  I have a 10-year-old sister who is going through changes.  heh there was this one instance where he thought I bought something online without permission, he kept yelling at me then threw his phone at me in rage, The problem he didn't check the date when I bought it.  He would also come in without an invitation, his reasons you ask? ""I'm your dad It's fine"" when I'm naked in the washroom about to take a shower and ""This is my house I get to do whatever I want""     Sorry if this is boring but I don't feel comfortable sharing the......Secret so...  Just let me know and I'll think about it My Annoying Dad Who Clearly Has No Privacy Manners"
786,1,I stopped taking my anxiety/depression medicine about 2 months ago because it makes it extremely difficult for me to orgasm. But recently I've become more depressed again and I just don't feel like doing anything. I don't know what to do. I'm getting depressed again
787,1,"I remember the first time I experienced depression when I was 8 years old. My bird “buddy” died in front of me and I remember laying on my bed with him for hours, staring at his lifeless corpse, learning what death is for the first time. This darkness enveloped me and began eating away at me day in and day out, thinking how pointless it all is if that is all it leads to. 

Years passed and I tried to adopt the mentality of “live for today” to dig myself out of that dark pit and all it lead to was a series of bad decisions which cemented my place in hell to this day. I’ve fallen in love, and been discarded as toxic three times for being my true self. I’ve had flings with a lot of women, which didn’t make me feel better at All Because I have no ego and generally that’s what one does to appease it. 

I’ve tried what I considered to be a fulfilling career as a tattoo artist, gained popularity and made my money that way for 8 years. but my art was dark and twisted and people who grew close to me eventually realized how toxic I am. I always held my friends to such high moral or fabricated ethical standards to the point that it understandably made them leave. 

I stayed isolated after about age 24. I lost all ambition to pursue relationships of any kind, lost ambition in art, career, fun, everything really because I feel unworthy. I feel like a chemical reject. Like something is deeply wrong with me and no matter what I do to hide this darkness, it sticks to my insides like cancer. 

My 32nd birthday just passed and I realized it’s been 8 years since I’ve felt close to anyone or have even been touched by someone. I live in my room in filth, barely able to muster the energy to watch tv. I only leave the house to get money for survival, I’ve gained almost 100 lbs, I’ve lost all my teeth in the front and my life has passed me by. Now I’m just waiting for my mom to die so I can put a bullet in my head and end this nightmare. I don’t want her to hurt when I do what needs to be done and she doesn’t have much longer. My dad recently died, my grandparents are dying, my brother and sister have disowned me, and I have never felt so alone. 

When my mom dies I won’t even be able to afford a funeral, it will be just a box in the ground and I’ll probably be the only one who cares because my brother and sister could care less if she died. I am so tired, i can’t even hold down a job for very long and I know I’m going to end up homeless soon. The thing that haunts me the most is knowing I missed my chance at life and there’s no going back. The amount of work it would take to come back from this would be like climbing 5 mount Everests without food or water, naked. It’s just not in me. All I can do now is rot in the personal hell I’ve made and wait for death. Pointless. Purposeless. I was here only to cast a shadow and return to dust. I hate myself and I wish I wasn’t so afraid to die. I just want this nightmare to end. 

Sorry for the self indulgent bs. I just had to get it out somehow. Personal hell"
788,1,"4 months ago my wife and i separated and a month and a half ago I lost my job.  Getting a new job has been very difficult given my legal status. 

I've moved back with my mom, I'm almost 30, I'm in my old room. I feel pathetic. 

I've slowly just been wasting away spiraling down.  I stay up late everyday, the only real productive part of my day is making it to jiu-jitsu, if it wasn't for that, i would probably fuck off all day and sleep, the only reason I can even convince my self to shower is because i refuse to be the smelly guy.  

I'm not even sure why I'm posting here, maybe it's for validation, I dont know, I dont even consider my feelings valid enough to even warrant this post. I feel like I'm typing this just for attention, oh look at me I'm fucking sad. 

I'm constantly throwing my self pity parties, oh fucking boo hoo me. I go down these depressing thought loops questioning my worth should I just fucking give up. 

The fucked up part is at times I actually enjoy this miserable fucking feeling i have inside. I enjoy the negativity boiling inside of me. 

Like fuuuuck it feels so good. How can these feelings coexist? why do I find a sense of comfort in misery? 

That's why i dont see this as a worthwhile post. Who actually thinks that way? 

Suicide crosses my mind buts not a line i would ever actually cross. I feel so selfish that i feel this way.  I have such a large support group. Like seriously, the people who surround me and that are willing to help me is something most people can only dream of. 

And yet here I am. I'm just so fucking selfish sometimes. In sit here and cry to my self well knowing I can pull my self out. But I just say fuck it. 

It's funny being this far down in this aimless rant. It has actually improved my mood a bit I actually feel silly typing all of this out. 

If you have gotten this far, you must have been really bored. I guess I just needed to rant get this off my chest. 

Goodnight yall. I'm not entirely sure if I even am depressed"

790,1,"And think “wow, I was self conscious back then!? I don’t even look that bad! I can’t believe that I thought the piece of shit I am now was the piece of shit I was back then.”

It’s weird. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess. Do you ever look back at old pictures of yourself"
791,1,"Smiling can be an excellent coping mechanism. That’s one of the most important things I took from counseling. Even though I may not feel the emotion of happiness well enough - forcing a smile is sort like taking your dopamine to the gym. Over time that part of your brain that gives you a sense of reward can become more active. This will help you discover new things you appreciate - helping you feel happier. 

Don’t get me wrong, most of mine are forced and it feels like its gonna take forever to see results. Like exercising, your effort will build into your goal.

Stay safe, defend your spirit and appreciate your life. Smile."

793,1,After feeling suicidal for a long time I finally saw a doctor and was prescribed two different pills. One is an anti depressant and one is supposed to help with vitamin balance or something like that which could have possibly been the reason I’m depressed. It doesn’t really feel like it’s working and I’m still depressed. I don’t go to therapy because it just makes it worse from my experience. What other treatments are available? I don’t want to keep spending money on pills waiting for one to *maybe* work. I don’t want to hospitalized or anything like that either. What’s after anti depressants?
794,1,"When im down, i go into ""the fake it"" mode and act like im ok with things. I fake laughs, smiles, confidence, and act like im fixing things in my life. I have to wear a fake smile for work, so im use to it. But i hate myself when im faking the funk, then the moment im alone, i basically revert to negitive mindset, let my mind race, and get down. Tried to distract myself, tried to keep busy, but socially i shut alot of people out, mentally and emotionally shut down. Bills worry me, social habits worry me, my kids worry me, im always worried. I hate it. 

I can wait to feel whole again, and not be judgemental and fake. I don't want pills, i dont want a therapist, a silent person to drop all my problems on. I just want a clear mind and fresh start. I feel 100% down, but still put in the fake smile and imitate positivity."
795,1,"I finally told my mom today after many years of not being okay. She cried, I cried. It was one of the hardest things I've done. I've been planning on talking to her for 2 weeks and finally built up the courage to do it today.

My Dad had depression and that did not end well so telling my mom about how I felt and have lived for a long time was very hard. 

We both agreed that when I go back to my University in August that I am going to get the free counseling over there. Telling my mom about this may seem small but for me it was huge and seems like a small step for the recovery process. I hope that when I go to school I actually follow through with getting help. I finally told my Mom"
796,1,"I had a failed suicide attempt 3 years ago and ever since I’ve been battling with trying not to try again. The most difficult part is, like, when I’m studying thoughts of “you should try again” or “people won’t miss you” suddenly comes into thought. Even when I’m surronded by friends and family the thought to try again is always there. So far it’s been a daily struggle. I cry a bit and then just take deep breaths and continue what I’m doing, some days I just sleep to keep my mind off it since I always feel tired after such thoughts. Do suicidal thoughts suddenly enter your mind even when doing mundane things?"

I’m meant to be starting a new job in a couple of days and I already want to call in sick because the idea of having to put on a smile and act like I’m fine is absolute hell to me. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I haven’t showered or brushed my teeth or hair today because I just don’t want to do anything. I haven’t even moved from bed today except to use the loo, I made myself dinner but not even because I was hungry, it was only because I had to defrost the food I was eating so it had been out and couldn’t be re-frozen or anything. It was probably the shittest and most depressing dinner I’ve ever eaten, and honestly I felt like I was going to vomit at the sight of food and I still feel like throwing it back up.

802,1,"Today seemed like a great day. Yesterday wasn't. My mind defaulted to thinking about yesterday and now I'm back in the dumps again. If suicide wasn't so criticized in modern-day society, I wouldn't think twice about it. Will society ever accept that some people have no reason or want to live? On a side note, I didn't get too many responses to painless methods of suicide on my post yesterday, but thank you to the one anon here that suggested nitrous oxide, I've been looking into it today. Maybe the happiness is from making my mind up about suicide? For the first time in over six months I felt happy. Less than twenty minutes later I returned to the usual."

807,1,"I was diagnosed with depression eight years ago. I spent the majority of two years unable to get out of bed from age fifteen and dropped out of high school. I enrolled to study as a full-time, external student at age eighteen and didn't make it through the first semester before I dropped out of that too. 

I took a break and focused on work and managing my mental health, finally getting to a place where I thought I would now be capable to try again. I again enrolled in study as a full-time, external student in February this year, whilst working full-time. At the beginning I was motivated and I smashed out the assignments, finishing with 100% marks and months earlier than their assigned due dates. That is, until my mental health began to rapidly decline.

It is debilitating. I haven't even been able to muster up the motivation to log in. All I want in life is to become a nurse and I have had this goal set for so long, but feel like it is out of my reach. I am smart, the coursework isn't hard. I know I am capable in that sense.

I suppose I am just seeking advice on what other's have done in a similar situation. I don't want to quit again. How do you manage as a student with having depression?"

I recently started a summer job and I feel like people I work with think I’m not capable of certain work, it makes me feel so useless and I keep questioning why I even bother for my degree. 

A few months ago I tried to do research but people would talk down to me a lot, it’s still happening at this job. The guys I work with are handed all these projects that they can do the bare minimum for and it’ll still be as though they’ve accomplished more than I have. I don’t know if it’s a gender thing or not but I’m sick of it. 

I feel like an idiot ever single day and I have to just remind myself, get paid, get through these next few weeks, and get out of there as fast as you can but it’ll probably be a viscous cycle wherever I go. I just wanna tell people sometimes, I’m not an idiot!! 

It’s just that everything is taking a toll on me all at once. Imposter syndrome."
812,1,"Hi! Sexual assault survivor here wondering if someone can relate to me. So it’s been about 4 almost 5 years since my experience. For a while I was very anti-anything in the sex department, but when I was 17 (two years after) I started having causal sex for the first time. I don’t mind having casual sex because it makes me feel like I have control over me and my body. I can’t describe but just the act of deciding when I give it to someone and I when I don’t makes me feel powerful because I didn’t get that option my first go round. I used to be really into casual sex in high school, but as of late, with starting college and all, I’ve kind of laid off it since I’ve been pretty busy. Two days ago, this guy who I thought hated me and I ended up having some fun (not full sex but pretty close). And like I normally don’t catch feelings and truthfully I don’t even know him that well, and I don’t know if this is just because I’m excited about it or if it’s like a serotonin high or I’ve actually caught feelings. But today, he told me he just wanted to have sex and not worry about  exclusivity or anything, which I totally understand because I’m usually the same way, but reflecting like just now, I’m actually kind of sad about it and I don’t know why. I have serious relationship problems"
813,1,"Just living life everyday feels like a fleeting experience, it feels like I’m rushing through everything and doing nothing. I hate being the person I am so much, thinking about who I am for any extended period of time kills me inside.

Also, just going through the day feels so sinister and surreal for some reason, like the room is watching me. I fucking hate it, everything is off. Nothing is going as planned and I can only blame me I feel so fucking empty"
814,1,"Hi. It’s the first time i see this subreddit and it gave me courage to write this. Excuse me for my written english, it’s not my native language.

On the past couple of years I have experienced a full downgrade on my life expectancy. I had a really cool job at a glass producing plant in Barranquilla, Colombia but they had a personnel cut and i was fired bc of that.

I’m an electronic engineer. My GPA was 4.1. Always good grades at school and at college. Parents proud. No bullying suffered. Everything came good. 

The day they fired me i was dirty, they called me after i fixed a glass tempering furnace. There were rumors on the company that maybe engineers would be cut off (i don’t know any synonyms of fired). I was the youngest of my crew only had 23 at that time. It really crashed me. I thought it was because of my experience. I had never received an attention call from my boss or anybody. Always did what i had to do. 

I guess that moment is important. Since then, august 2017: I have never work in the career i chose and i love.

I went to Panama two weeks after that in order to help an aunt with being a parking cashier, and to explore opportunities here, i didn’t mind doing it, my father went here too and got a well paid job, he didn’t got any in colombia, things still are tough. So it was the two of us. 

I wanted to work on my career and the only thing I needed was a work permit. After a year and a half, and a lot of money spent i couldn’t have the work permit and i was obliged to quit my job as cashier and to go back to my country. I was devastated. I couldn’t do anything. Time and money wasted all over. This all happened last december. 

Came back to colombia on february in order to get a job of my career. Things are tough. Companies want to hire a 25-30 year old worker with 10y experience. On minimum wages. My dad told me there was a chance to study another thing here in panama. Marketing and Advertising. I started in may. Im getting good grades, everything’s good. He tells me i need a job here, he can’t pay this. I don’t have work permit. I don’t have anything else that my passport. I’m ‘illegal’. I can study and graduate but i have to leave the country every three months in order to renew my status. 

I don’t blame my father, he paid me a career. I just don’t know what to do. I know work dignifies man. I just don’t want to spend my life being the adult i didn’t want to be as a kid. A loser. I can’t find any job now. I don’t know if i chose well. I can’t find any job here. I was trying to teach kids here to make some cash but no luck at that. 

I have looked for suicide avoiding methods. I don’t want to die. But suddenly i think it could solve my problem. I don’t want to die but i don’t know what to do. 

I appreciate the people who could read this. I really hope someone could help me"
815,1,"So first for context, Im a 400lb or 181KG (for the rest of the world) male, 5""8 or 176cm, 20 YO

I dont really know how to express my feelings but this is my best try. The beginning will be ALOT of context

 For my whole life I have managed to convince myself that everything would be okay eventually. My weight has been a problem for a long time, it severely impacted my self esteem but I considered myself intellectually skilled so I used that to remain afloat. I think have a supportive family when I share my concerns or emotions but it just doesn't come easily to me. My mother means the world to me and some, and i love my sister almost as equally. My mother is very sick, when its not one condition making her ill its another. I am a roman catholic, and am now in the summer before my last year of University. 

I am constantly having episodes of ""emotions"" (its what i call it) but i can usually am able to move past it with some sleep and convincing myself everything is going to be alright. Recently everything is failing to help alleviate my suffering. Due to the exposure of the catholic church's crimes I am distant from the church, which used to be one of the things I looked towards when feeling down. I make a point to try and not dream  (about trivial things such as vacations or stuff like that ) due to the fear of disappointment, i had learned from experience that it hurts more to have hoped so I prefer not to. 

I have thought of self harm before, and my sister studies medicine so im familiar with how to go through with it if i wanted to. However, the thought of the damage I would cause in my household (my mom would die of a heart attack and everyone would die inside from having lost my mom) and my religious beliefs have kept me away from any attempts. 

Academically, I have underpreformed in college due to procrastination, which I contribute to laziness or simply the fear of actually trying and failing as that would destroy the little self esteem I have left (i dont know but i read about the second one and it could be true) . I have somehow made it to this point and had a fairly decent semester. I was within the 385ish range of weight for the last about 6 months and paid for a overpriced but good gym subscription (since i felt money motivates me)  and for a few months it was going okay, lost a bit of weight but when the semester began it became complicated. I dont have a license to drive yet and my sister works so our schedules became difficult. As a result, our time in the gym has diminished to basically nothing. 

The reason why this is important is because I feel myself slowly losing sight of all things good in my life. 

Recently, I reach the big 400 pounds. I can still walk and take care of myself at least. But when I read the scale I became unable to ignore the elephant in the room. The real reason I avoid any social interaction with people, and prefer to spend all day at home. The same reason i dont attend classrooms if they are in a lecture hall, and the same reason I haven't tried to get (and keep) a job. I feel my life is limited by my weight. 

I cant sit in the same position for a prolonged period of time before my limbs begin to go numb , im always out of breath, i cant sleep in one position for long because it begins to ache, I am afraid to go out because im not sure if where i go will be fat friendly or if the chair will feel as if its crumbling under me. I really want my drivers license but im afraid of trying because last time i practiced my limbs were going numb from sitting and my arms dont reach the steering wheel in any comfortable position. I recently turned down a vacation opportunity because the last time i was on a plane i was uncomfortable and crossing over into my neighbors chair space. 

Usually this would be just fine but I have come to the realization that I want to live my life but cant. Im tired of acting like i just dont want to go to the movies, im tired of acting like i dont die inside every time I enter a store and cant find anything my size, im tired of convincing myself i dont want to date so that i can ease the pain of being as attractive as jobba the hutt. Im just so tired of being in my body. I was always able to keep hope that one day with hard work I would get to an okay weight, but its been 15+ years of hoping and im out of hope. I feel guilty for being so tired of life when my family tries so hard to fill me with love, but its just not enough. Everything is going numb again, stuff isnt as funny as it used to be and honestly life feels like its just passing me by. Im increasingly upset and bothered by my own existence. Everything sucks and I dont want to continue living like this (i have no intention of committing suicide ever so that is not a concern) I want to be happy and laugh, I want to breathe and run and jump. I want to feel warmth when my mother hugs me, but recently everything is so bland. I read books about people who have been depressed and described everything as gray and until now i never knew how true that could be. I am not diagnosed so I do not believe I have depression but my emotional state is just making me miserable. I have tried everything to lose weight but have had no luck, even if i did try i just cant motivate myself to do anything anymore. 

 My parents have noticed my change in mood and I believe my mother is beginning to fear something is wrong with me as she was overly affectionate and reassuring today.

I really just wanted to rant and get some of these emotions off my chest, If anyone has any suggestions on what could help id appreciate that too. I want to talk about it but I cant"

817,1,"This is usually how conversations work when someone talks to me first.

""Hey man! It's been awhile, how've you been?""

""I've been doing fine. How about you?""

""Today's been going pretty well. Heard of (new thing) going around.""

""Yeah, sounds pretty cool too. Might get that someday.""

&amp;#x200B;

I can't maintain a proper conversation with people, unless if it's about something we both enjoy. Now the things I enjoy are things some people haven't really seen or heard of, so I understand why I can't get much talk from people.

But when it comes to talking, like just regular, plain talk, I choke up. Can't seem to break my habit of keeping quiet until the other person speaks, which leads into this never ending spiral of awkwardness, until one of us just up and leaves.

Kind of frustrating. Anyone ever had this happen to them? Any way to keep a conversation going? conversations are weird to me"
818,1,"I hate feeling disconnected from myself and the world. I hate that the memories of happiness I once adored has now faded and has become foreign to me. I hate that it feels almost impossible to enjoy anything anymore. That I can't even enjoy my surroundings, the sky, flowers, or anything that might ignite beauty. I try so hard to appreciate those things but it won't allow me to. 

I feel like I might be going through an episode. But the damned thing about it is not being able to realize it might stop one day. It feels never ending. 

Is there help? Is there a way to break free and latch onto reality again and appreciate the small things? Or am I destined to be doomed? Doomed that my mind cannot perceive why it feels fake and why it mistakes the sensation of feeling real. I may be cursed, in a sense that I cannot feel like me anymore. 

I fucking hate it. I hate DPDR"

I can feel my self slipping into that dark hole again. I can feel the negative thoughts slipping in.  I'm trying to feel like I'm happy but I can just feel the sadness. Idk if this makes sense. I'm just lost. Trying not to fall back into the dark pit

I want to be happy. I want to get rid of the voice that tells me my husband doesn't actually love me. The voice that says no matter how many college degrees I get, I'll always be a mediocre employee who won't ever get anywhere in life. The voice that tells me I should have finished the job 6yrs ago... when I was raped and didn't know how to process what had happened.

Anyone who looks at my life would say it's a good one though. I just bought a house (a trailer, but it's a house nonetheless). I have a good paying job. I work from home. I have straight As in my classes. My son is starting school soon. I'm always being told to look on the bright side and be grateful for the good life I have. I don't know if I want to though. I just don't know how to feel or what to do anymore. All I know is that I just want to stop crying all of the time. I want to stop crying..."

The only thing I’ve actually noticed positively is that gut feeling when I’m anxious isn’t as churning. Other than that, I feel good when I’m in the gym and I’m lifting cause it helps me filter the anger out but afterwards I go back into my head and I’m ready to shutdown and shut everyone out.

825,1,"I'm suicidal. In fact I'm just bored with life. Beyond bored. Nothing I do brings me any joy and I've been like that ever since I was barely 5 years old. I remember always having to fake being happy and smiling. But I've never experienced fun. I still don't and I don't understand why. Ive been trying for years and years to find something, anything, that'll bring me some enjoyment but it never happened. I wasted so much money on hobbies I thought I could get into, only to have it collecting dust in my closet. Books are boring, I can't concentrate for the life of me. Even pets.. they're nice and all but even they do not bring me any joy. Watching movies is boring, I have yet to actually finish one completely. I don't know what my problem is. I think something in my head was working wrong when I was born. I literally cannot feel joy. I feel sadness and crippling depression and boredom and debilitating anxiety, yes, but I can't remember a time where I felt something good. I'm not exaggerating this, it really is like this. And i don't know... what is life if you can't ever have fun? Then it just becomes a chore, something you do to keep family happy. It becomes an obligation. Life is not a choice for me. Not one worth living. What could be so wrong with me that I was literally depressed when I was just 5 years old? What could be so wrong in my head that I'm unable to feel anything positive. Pictures of smiling babies or puppies don't make my heart flutter. I've also never been in love or had a crush on anyone. It's like I just can't feel emotions. Only negative ones. Nobody takes me serious when I explain this because they all think ""there must be SOMETHING you enjoy. Maybe you just haven't found it' and something else I often hear is 'you can't know what sadness is if you've never experienced happiness' which is utter bulshit obviously. My mother even told me that I was a weird baby and child. Always quiet, always playing by myself. She told me that she knew from the first day on that something about me was..off.

So I'm here now.. going towards my thirties and I've suffered so, so much, and I'm just tired. Tired of being tired. I just want it to end and I know I don't want to kill myself before my mother passes away because I don't want to hurt her, but it's been getting even harder lately. I don't know if I can do this much longer. I don't think I've ever been this close to suicide. But who cares, right? Who even reads this anyway. I'm just at a loss as to what to do. Anyway, at least I got this off my chest. I guess that's something. Not that it helped. What comes after depression? What do you call depression that is even worse?"
826,1,"i can’t, it’s too painful, it feels numbing, yet it hurts unexplainably terrible. every time i think things are getting better, there’s always just that day that tears it all down.

i can’t stop drowning in the tears after another argument which i haven’t had in such a long time. i thought life was going for the better, but it’s just never enough for my mother. i thought i was changing for the better, but i wasn’t enough to her.

she kept arguing with me after my appointment with my physiatrist, she even grounded me for something that i’m struggling through. she said in order for me to not be grounded is to “get better”. 

she even said afterwards “you don’t even go to sleep on time like i tell you to, i know you can. you never listen to me”. she knows that i struggle with insomnia even, but she doesn’t think it’s real. it’s even on my documents, yet she still says such things.

she brings up that is been 2 months since my diagnosis, and questions why aren’t i better yet. it’s been years for since i felt this way, not just 2 months. she brings up the money for all of my appointments and such, it honestly makes me feel like i’m just a waste of money.

she knows the things that goes on, and yet it’s a different story when i talk to my doctors. she never explains why the things happen, and why i become so destructive of myself. the arguments, constantly hurting, overwhelming me.

i know i’m weak, but i’ve been trying to “get better” like you’ve wanted me to be!! you want me to change!! i want to too!! but after every argument, it destroys me!! i don’t want to live a life like this anymore!!

i thought i was actually progressing, it’s been like two months with professional help and me actually trying to better myself. but i just wasn’t ever enough to them. i can’t ever reach their expectations.

i just don’t have the ability to change, ever it feels like. my head is hurting, it’s a never ending cycle."

I was feeling somewhat okay and now I just feel like shit. This was a reminder of how hideous I am, and how I'll always struggle to find partners. I am so ugly that I'm sure it's been affecting my social life as well. It's definitely affected my confidence. It's hard to feel confident when society is so superficial and when worth is tied in with looks for a woman. I feel deflated now, if that's how my feeling can be expressed. Just lost all energy, lost hope when it comes to feeling less isolated. Why am I so worthless? I'm ugly, stupid, unfunny and a weirdo.

Hello people of r/depression, I wanted to talk a bit with you tonight as I can't sleep, I am a very anxious person and if there was a way to remove any physiological need, that would be ~~anxiety~~ sleep. 

It came in my mind that I wanted to learn more about depression, but instead of doing a boring lonely research on Internet, I would really like to hear your personal point of view on depression and how it is actually impacting your life. 

I have a lot of question I would like to ask you but I will pose them after I tell you a little story that happened to me a year ago...

For the first time in my life, I seriously thought I was depressed and it all came up because I slowly realized how bad my life was and how bad I wanted to modify it. For a month or so, everyday was like the others. I am not talking about the daily routine, but the thinking process that permeated them. 

I would get up, get at the mirror, watch my tired face and realize, that would have been another day closed in myself (even if I live with other three roomates), because of my fear of confrontation. I lived those days thinking constantly how bad I was in social contexts, and all I wanted was to isolate myself, and cuddle myself in tears of hope. It was the cry of a man that wished had tried love other than the natural kind your parents are always willing to give. I was dying inside to have somebody honest to talk to, somebody I could trust but I knew I could not find it soon or later, because the problem of my social anxiety was only me and myself, nothing else. Those were days of extreme isolation, playing even alone on my PC, not even willing to speak to my usual online friends. 

I would cry almost two times at day, mostly because I wanted a partner in study or simply a partner in life. 

I seriously thought about suicide for one time and how I would do it, but being the instinctively optimist person I am, I quickly erased those thoughts and replaced them with hopeful sadness. 



Now, I know some people suffer of real depression, meaning there is a kind that you can get after following certain habits for a long time, but there is also a kind that comes naturally installed in your brain when you grow up. 

I wanted to ask YOU, the person who is reading, some personal questions and opinions about your actual living state and how life has changed after you got daily depression striking your mind. 

Here is a list of questions I have for you:

1) How old are you?
 
2) What triggered your depression? 

3) What do you miss most of not being depressed? 

4) What do you think could help you in completely remove depression? (it can be anything, I want you to be completely honest here. A better society? Somebody that really understands you? Expecting something from people? Expecting something from yourself? Wish you had or did not have something in your body, or mental ability?) 

5) How is your day? Can you see a routine in your life? 

6) What are some things you instead like of depression? For example the calmness after a whole day crying in bed, or taking a med. 

7) Could your depression be cured if the kind of person you always wanted to meet randomly joins your life? (The teacher/son/partner/SO/lover/friend you always wanted in your life. Even, dunno, a person that every morning would show up at your door and shout ""Ehy bro come on let's do some bullshit together this morning"") 

I don't want to sound childish with these questions but I always thought depression is a state of the mind where it locks itself in a boring and never exciting experimentation of life, even new things don't excite you anymore, not because you don't like them but because probably nobody is willing to listen you speaking about them, if not your therapist. 

I hope this post doesn't get deleted. 

And I really hope I get some answers to read. 

And I repeat, as an anxious person I have a huge respect in people that struggle with major disorders and still find the strength every morning, to get out of bed and hoping to find joy someday. 

YOU are the real warriors. Hi people, I wanted to ask you some genuine curious personal questions, to learn more about your point of view on depression..."

840,1,"Just venting. 

I'm 32, going on 33, and I've missed every major milestone in my life - no first kiss, no prom, no best friend moments, no first roommates, no college experiences (I commuted to college from home). Mostly it was because of my weight and the social anxiety that came from that, but even when I dropped lots and lots of weight when I was 26 for work (went down 100 lbs to where I was actually happy enough to take photos of myself for the first time in my life) it didn't do anything. 

Fast forward to now and I'm back up to my old fat self and working at a boring job as an adult. I signed up for a gym a few weeks ago and I've been going steadily and I've decided to get back down to the weight where I was happy again, but does it matter? I've missed every milestone in my life and nothing changed like I thought it would. I didn't magically get friends or learn how to be a socially-functioning adult. And I didn't want to - I wanted to be a teenager again, but I couldn't do it. 

The very few people I've ever oppened up to about this have said stupid, insipid shit like ""milestones aren't real"" or ""everyone lives life differently"", but that's complete bullshit from people who have had their moments. I can't get those moments back at my age and I've missed core personal development in high school and college that I can't just re-grow. 

I don't know what to do. I want to stop hating everyone around me becuase it's destroying what few casual friendships I have and sometimes it leaks out as pure venom that always throws people off (I do customer/technical service, so I just use my 'service personality' all the time). It's getting harder and harder to bottle it all up. And on the rare occassions I can look past the jealousy and hatred and just hang out with people, they always say I'm immature for my age because I'm just stuck personality-wise. Is that arrested development?

tl;dr: it's hard to be motivated to lose weight again when I've been through it before and nothing changed. Self-Improvement at this stage of my life feels empty."
841,1,I have a bottle of pain killers beside me and I’m ready to take them all. I’m done with the fake smiles and acting like I’m happy all the time just so no one sees the emptiness in my eyes. I don’t have anything to really live for and I just want to be finally happy on the other side. I’m trying not too but I want to so bad!
842,1,"It's really bad. I fucked my future with my stupid anxiety. All work for nothing. Will search professional help. I feel like a piece of shit.

843,1,"(Title seems a bit judgy yeah,) but seriously, myself included, it feels like nobody is happy anymore. With me, it’s like nothing is a big deal anymore and everything is sort of losing its value. When I hang with friends, it’s like something is missing. When I’m out with family, it just seems so typical now. Then I look at others, and some actually feel the same. Everyone back in years like 2012, 2013, 2016, everyone was happy, but now it’s like everyone is too busy clinging onto nostalgia and nobody cares anymore (including me). Why is nobody happy anymore?"

847,1,"I’ve been dealing with depression on and off over the years but this year it really hit hard. I started doing a lot of things I shouldn’t have because in the moment they made me smile just a little bit. Now that it’s summer and I’m just sitting at home binge eating, and sleeping my days away my depression is at its worse. 

The other week my grandparents visited and we went out to a safari thing, before we went my stepmom came and talked to me. She said “your grandparents are here to visit you for your birthday, and to have a good time. So can you try to be a little positive when we go out?”

I’m sorry if I’m not smiling, but it’s not as simple as just trying to be positive. “Try to be a little positive” is the last thing I want to hear"
848,1,Feeling very depressed. Been a second since this has happened and that I had noticed it.  Just that feeling of my body being as heavy as iron and my mind being a foggy swamp and that I want my sensory processing to cease. Hope I will fall asleep soon. Honestly hope that's the last thing I think and that there isn't a tomorrow. Feeling
849,1,"Hey, I’m new to reddit and just seeing what you guys think. I guess I’ll give a little back story. So I think I’ve been depressed for awhile, with the constant moving as a kid and having to make friends and lose friends constantly. Well when I finally got out on my own it’s just been a disaster lol. I work I have a car I don’t live in a terrible place for now. But I constantly move last year I had moved 3 different places and lived in a hotel for almost a month. And also couple years I feel like I can’t keep or make any new friends. I always think to myself maybe it’s me? Maybe I’m just really annoying, idk. And I’ll constantly go from being happy for awhile to back to this pain and suffering in my head to where looking at one of my guns makes it all so tempting. Last year I went through a nasty break to top it all up and I feel like it was all my fault in why things becoming such a mess. But lately I’ve just been drinking a lot more on my own and harder if I go out with friends. I feel as I haven’t made any effort to make any changes to better myself, where that saying of definition of insanity is so true. Not sure if there’s any hope feel like there’s nothing I can do. Just feel like a real pshit person. Have no idea what is wrong with me, but feel like I’ve been like this for awhile."
850,1,"I don't even know how to start this thing because in my head its a garbled mess but I am just at a loss of what to do in my life as of now. I don't have the mental energy for anything anymore. I can't seem to find anything as engaging as I used to no matter what it is. I am all but apathetic about almost everything in life. I recently moved back into my parents house to try and get better after breaking up with my fiance. The idea behind it was to have the time to focus on working out and seeing a therapist. It seems like I blinked and all of the sudden I have a job that is basically full time, haven't worked out once and am nowhere near better. I didn't want a job when I moved here, the point was not to have one. When I asked my parents to move back they said it was fine and I didn't have to worry about anything yet once I got here they wanted me to make money and work so now I work 4-5 days a week even though that was specifically what I moved here to do.

Just the thought of trying to eat healthy and seeing if I can work out again sounds overwhelming. Now I don't know how I could possibly do that with a job and normal day to day stuff that is hard for me too (like hygiene and shit). Most days it feels like I am just waiting until the time comes when I have to do something else, like go to work, and then once I get to that next thing, I just wait until the time goes by on that so I can go back home or whatever is next. My whole life seems like its killing time until the next event that kills time until the next one and so on and so on. I don't ever feel like I have the mental energy to do anything let alone the motivation to get my shit together and get better.

Part of me just wants to start over again and move back to the city that I actually enjoy since this hasn't seemed to be working but neither did living there so...I guess I just feel trapped and lost and don't even know what to do. I am seeing a therapist but he had a family emergency and I haven't been able to see anyone for a few weeks now and even then, I don't know what good it is going to do.

I feel like I sound like a whiny teenager at this point and I don't know if I am making any sense in the first place, so sorry for the steam of conscious post as I sit here at work trying to see a way out of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I literally just posted this and then was reading some other posts on here and so many people have it worse than I do and now I almost feel like I shouldn't even be complaining. I have never thought about suicide and have had a relatively easy life, I shouldn't be feeling anything like this at all. This also really sounds like I am just whoring for attention to be honest. I'm not, I just don't want to burden my friends or family anymore and this seemed like a decent place to just kind of vent I guess. As cliche as it is, I'm just completely lost right now."
851,1,"I understand for most people, suicide isn't the answer. Most people have worth, potential, and a chance to get better. 

But what about that small minority of people who are beyond the point of no return? The people who's mental illness puts them at danger, and sometimes those around them. Isn't it more humane to let them stop suffering? Isn't it better to just let me suffering? I made everyone around me feel worse to the point that I have no one. I constantly torture myself by trying to stay alive. I'm a freak, I'm a lunatic, I'm subhuman. I have no purpose to be here. So what's so wrong with offing myself? It'd be better for both of us. Why is suicide so hated?"
852,1,"People manufacture fake lives on social media, and it's too easy to get jealous and compare yourself with people you know. I think most people, especially young adults, don't even realize when it happens. 

Social media can be detrimental, but it can also help ""surround yourself with good people.""  You don't have close your account, in fact, if your introverted or don't have anyone around you can lean on, I think you should use it. Great people are on there who can make an impact in a positive way.  Follow them! Don't follow your friends. Follow people you can learn and draw inspiration from to help you become a better person. Aim for positive mindset and personal growth."

856,1,"Throwaway account.

I haven’t felt happy in years. I made probably what was my point 10th attempt at a relationship a week ago today. My best friend and I had gotten pretty close, and I started to want more than that. She seemed pretty into me, and told me she just ended her current relationship about a week prior. I ended up asking her out and she says she thinks she feels the same way, and to give her sometime to think about it. 

Over the next week she quickly gets closer to me. She tells me she’s closer to me than anyone else, that I’m her favourite person, that I treat her better than any other guy. We get a lot more comfortable around each other, to the point where she’s pretty much stuck to me like glue, always basically stood onto of me and hugging me all the time. 2 days ago I asked her if she had made up her mind, but she said she was still unsure. 

Yesterday she was a lot quieter than usual, and clearly didn’t want to talk to me as much. I gave her a bit of space and went on to go do some other stuff. Late that night she messaged me telling me she had to tell me something. It turns out she was still dating the other guy, and they were just going through a rough patch but now they are back together.

I feel like shit. It was the happiest I’ve been in years and it was her that made me happy. She was the one I would always go to when I felt depressed or anxious and now I can’t talk to her without wanting to die. I wish I could take it back and just go back to being friends, but I don’t think I can. I also don’t want to leave her completely because she’s was my best friend and also struggles with depression. I don’t know what to do, but right now I’m just trying to bottle everything up. I’ve officially given up on relationships, given up on happiness and slowly getting closer to killing my self. It’s not worth the effort anymore.

Fuck. I have finally given up."
857,1,"Hi folks,

I wonder if anyone is suffering the following symptoms like me for years:

1. Repetitive negative thoughts concerning harassments happened, imagined expected annoying situations, manipulating dialogues or frustrations.
2. Loss of joy in life or planning for anything in the future.
3. Being on edge with distracted mind. 
4. Avoiding people and being hyper sensitive to their opinions.
5. Feeling ""blank"" most of the time 
6. Suffering psychosomatic symptoms like: chest pain, joint pain, costochondritis, trembling or irregular heart rhythm (pvc/pvp).

Given that I'm single 34yo male, non-smoker, having daily sport.

Any app /book /routine /diet advice will be appreciated.

Thank you :) PT:Mixed anxiety / depression sufferers, any advice(s)?"
858,1,"Throughout the years I've been feeling as if I'm losing my wit. It's harder to think of things to say, harder to think and I'm not as fluent and entertaining as I used to be. Do you also share this exprience? Anyone else feel like they got dumber"
859,1,"With depression, I have always had this little voice in my head that would have nothing nice to say. It was the same voice that told me I was fat and ugly and lead me to an eating disorder where I lost 30 pounds in 3 months and still felt fat. It was the same voice that told me I was not good enough to be loved, to be happy, that I was not smart enough and that being alive was pointless. It was the same voice that pushed me to suicide.

After all this, I took a lot of time to reflect and did a lot of self CBT. During this, a new voice came round and it was magnificant. It was kind to me. It helped me lose weight in a positive, slow, and healthy way with encouraging words like ""You are beautiful."" ""Great job today!"" ""Don't feel bad for having a cheat day/rest day, we all need breaks!"" As a result, I gained a magnificant new body and felt confident and pretty for the first time. I enjoyed going out. I could socialize and was more enjoyable with my family and friends. The voice became my best friend and anytime I was sad or had a bad encounter, it was always there to reassure me that **it was ok**.

Lately I have been so overwhelmed with life that I had no time to listen to it anymore, and slowly the dark thoughts began to arise. I gained weight and because I have been struggling with securing a job and progressing, my outlook began to look bleak again and the voice kept edging me to ""give up"" and ""end it all"". The thoughts were scary and so familar and I could feel myself sinking into it once more. Until today.

Today I found my strength to find the positive voice again. Today I told myself instead of how ""much weight I gained"" that I should be proud that despite the weight I gained, that I still made an effort to exercise and eat right everyday. Despite my current unemployment struggles and how much of a bum I am, I told myself how strong I was that I never stopped for a day to email/call/and apply to every job I could. Despite how ugly I felt in my photos, the positive thoughts came through and pointed out how how they are all pictures of me outside, walking, and not locked up. The thoughts reminded me I wasn't as ugly as I felt and I should take the time to cleanse my skin and brush my hair before sleeping. 

I know this might sound weird, but there is a happy voice in all of us. Don't lose it. Be kind to yourself and tell yourself constantly that you are beautiful, you are worth it, and remind yourself of all the positives you accomplished in a single day and you will be surprised how much they add up. Found the happy little voice in my head again"
860,1,"Hey, I'm just a 16 year old guy who just finished secondary school, and just like every other summer, I've sat in my room doing absolutely nothing for weeks. I can't go anywhere, or hang out with some friends or whatever because I only have like 1 real life friend, and he completely ignores me if I text him to hang out or whatever. And it doesn't make me feel better at all when I see people on Instagram sharing stories, and they're all at parties or just having fun or whatever. And I don't hate them for having it or whatever, I just wish I could have that too, and yeah I know, I gotta get out there and talk to people if I wanna make friends but it's not that easy, I'm extremely socially awkward. What totally doesn't help with my self esteem is that throughout Secondary, I always heard people talking behind my back, seen people looking at me, I've been called 'ugly' and other shit like 'you're a depressing person' or whatever, right to my face. I've felt alone for so long, I've always been surrounded by people but always felt like the outcast. I'm scared of being alone forever. Another thing: Nothing excites me anymore. I'd be excited about like, movies coming out or something, like Spider-Man: Far From Home (which im seeing tomorrow lol) or the fact that I'm going to New York, America, for the first time. I've always wanted to see the United States for myself my whole life but I really just don't care much. I'm also ugly as fuck, I'm chubby, one eye is always slightly swollen so it looks weird, big nose, weird lips, it makes me afraid to show myself in public. I also have long hair which probably looks terrible but I have it long for a reason that's hard to explain, I just feel more secure with it, like I'm safe lol if that makes sense. Anyway, I went off track a bit, I've felt suicidal for about 6 months, not been on the verge of actually killing myself or anything but I've seriously thought about it. I don't think I could go through it right now, because I know what it would do to my family. I do know that I'll do it someday though, not tomorrow, not next month or next year, but I don't think I'll live a full life. I've always just felt that it would be easier to just die, life isn't worth it. Yeah I've tried talking to my friends/family about it, my online friends have been really helpful, and I went to see a doctor with my mom, we talked about medication and stuff but it didn't really get us anywhere and I haven't gone back since then. I feel like I'm being overdramatic a lot of the time. I just hate myself, I wish I was someone else, just a completely different person, different life. Anyway, idk how to end this, I just wanted to let it all out. If you made it this far, thanks for reading lol I'm lonely and stuff"

862,1,"There are two types of motivation: pull factor and push factor. It’s comparable to acting out of love versus acting out of fear. For example, a horse may be compelled by its desire the carrot, or by its want fear of the spur. I’m at the unfortunate position of lacking both. When I was younger, I never got into sports because I wasn’t interested, and my parents didn’t force me. As a result, I was, and have remained since, out of shape. Now, my parents become upset with my inherent laziness, even though it was their neglect to enroll me that resulted in this. And to this day, they fail to prod me on into activity, besides getting me out of bed each day.
I did have an occasional spike of motivation, in the form of my crush. We had been friends for a few months beforehand, and the possibility of gaining of her attention on a romantic level made me drunk with determination. For once, I was actually doing something physical. But, long story short, I blew it. Furthermore, even after 9 months, she still hasn’t said a word to me. That pain of not only losing an opportunity for a relationship, but also the pain of losing a close friend, was staggering. To make matters worse, I still had to see her every single day at our small charter school. I fell back into my old depressive habits, if not worse, for I knew what I had lost. Now, the only reason I get out of bed is because I know my dad will eventually force me out.

But the amount he was willing to pay for my psych stays, meds and other stuff makes me sad and anxious to this day. I thank god that I was lucky enough to experience wonderful parental love. On the other hand it eats me away because I fucked it all up with what I have become. They are the only reason I‘m still alive.

869,1,"After a full year of urging, I was finally successful in convincing my girlfriend to seek professional help (her first session with the Psychiatrist should be within two months). She has very heavy bouts of hopelessness and helplessness regarding her life, many self-harm scars, and idealizes suicide, so I'm sure they will diagnose her with depression.

I was able to explain to her how much medication was able to change my perspective and that it might have great effects on herself as well. Since she received a doctorate in Pharmacy before falling into her current state, pills weren't the hard sell. The hardest part now, is convincing her that medication and therapy are two equally important halves to the treatment, and that their positive effects with each other are multiplicative, not additive.

Despite my efforts, she assures me that she is positive she will never go to therapy. It is also her belief that as her boyfriend and her only friend, I alone will suffice as her sole emotional counsel/coping resource. As I only have a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology that I half-assed back in college, I am positive I am not qualified to be someone's therapist.

Assuming that I will never be able to push her toward true therapy, do my fellow r/depression supporters have any advice on how I should proceed? I am thinking that I should aim to mostly just listen and be supportive, but urge her to question her more negative thought processes. My Girlfriend asked me to be her Personal Therapist - Advice?"

We recently received our degree scores, me and all my friends received a similar grade (2:1s). I’m the only one who’s unhappy with how it turned out.

I can never settle into a relationship because I always feel I can do better (I understand this makes me conventional trash, please don’t kill me for this I beat myself up for it enough). Moreover I rarely talk to the opposite sex on nights out etc because I’m too fearful of rejection.

I find myself relentlessly self criticising every time I make a mistake in any field of endeavour, even in ones I have limited experience in. I find myself alone with just my frequently dangerous thoughts for company due to my social anxiety. I can’t ever accept failure, or even second place. This develops into self hatred and self mutilation.

I also have anxiety, causing me to overthink failures and find holes in successes - I recently won my first amateur boxing bout and now I’m struggling to find solace in it. That was my original hope, that I’d get peace and a sense of internal harmony from it, but my practically uncontrollable mind had other ideas.

876,1,"I never had anyone who was really my friend.
My parents are great, but emotionally distant, I tried to approach them to the lengths of my 27 years of life but without success.
I've never been supported, EVER!
In choosing courses for college, in choosing a profession. I've tried everything from college computing, worked 2 years with e-sports, tried government jobs through tests, now I'm in the financial market. Never, no one, absolutely no person in this world, never supported me, believed me.
And when I finally thought I'd found someone who might be a special person, she'd start to treat me like crap overnight.

I tried to ignore it, I thought it might just be a few days and then she would see that she had been a bit of an idiot.
So today, I had a panic attack on the street, I was very disoriented and luckily I made a call to my sister who came to pick me up and take me away (besides that too, besides saying that it was because she got pity of my parents if I died and did not want it in her conscience).

I went and told the person that I thought would be special.
I told him I had been ill on the street and that my sister had rescued me.

Then she turned to me and said: You are a stupid! Why did you go out on the wrong street? I'm not going to put my hand on your head, no!

And I kept trying to tell her that I did not leave because I was feeling bad, I left because I had to solve things on the street and I had a bad time on the way, and yet she continued to offend me, minimizing me.

And it turned out that in the end, I was apologizing to her (???) ...


I can not take it anymore.
I really do not deserve to be treated like this.
My whole life I tried to help people, I stopped putting food at home so I could pay for transportation so my friend could go to college.
I stop doing lots of things for me to help someone.
I never lifted my hand to anyone, I never raised my voice to anyone, I was never disrespectful to anyone.

I always believed that being a good person, one day life would treat me a little better.

But everything that happens to me is bad!
I gave shelter to a friend I had known for more than 10 years when he had nowhere to live, and he went and stole everything from my house.
I sold my car to help pay the debt of another friend so he could finish college, and then he called me an idiot for that and he never spoke to me again.
I dated a person for 8 years and a week before we got married, she broke up with me saying that it was fun to be with me but that I was leaving for Italy with someone else.

I have no friends, I have no relatives with whom I can count, with whom I can open myself.

I'm scared, because once again I find myself in the position where in my head I only have one thing to do ...

I do not know if anyone will read this, but if you read, and are going through difficulties, be stronger than me and do not believe in people, because nobody is worth in this world! I do not know if anyone will read, I just had to put it out before it's too late."
877,1,"I feel like I am only existing and doing nothing and I hate myself so much because of that. I feel like  I am just losing best years of my life,I'm 17. I have good friends and we all have good relationship but they can't understand my state. When we hang out, they all talk laugh and they are all having a good time, but for me, I am just pretending to be happy . Because they can't understand it I don't bother explaining anything. I am like this all my life. Feeling kinda okay for a month then completely miserable and depressed for 3 months. I've learned to live like this but sometimes I would like to rip my soul out. I am so weird, a complete perfectionist among other things, so I can't easily find person that really suits me,person that I would like to spent time with. I am too serious for my age but I can't change that, I really tried but I can't. I am aisocial and I like peace and silence but as time goes by I am often questioning myself is that the real me or just my depression. I hate this so much, I hate that I feel lonely even when I am out with people who love me and I am so scared and angry, thinking it will never stop. I  feel like I am losing interest in things that I loved doing. I wanna change and I don't know how... I want to be out with people, having fun but even when I try it's just, kinda painful.. I wanna know will it ever stop, that sick feeling of loneliness, sadness and misery. Can I somehow fix myself? I can't stand people but I need some occupation to stay away from bad thoughts"
878,1,"I’m just really depressed all the time.  I just want to cry and shit all day. But like during the day I’m so happy until I realize I’m fucking sad and then I become sad!

I can’t have one day without my mom blaming me for shit or yelling. I miss my friends and X. I hate listening to his songs cause I miss him so fucking much! 

I wish I could just be happy. It takes me forever to go to sleep cause I keep thinking and crying. 

My friends leaving. My only friend! (She isn’t the only one but the only one where I can truly be happy with) and I’ll probably never see her again. Maybe one day. But I don’t think that will be for a while. I miss her even tho she isn’t even gone yet. 

I just want to cut myself and starve and cause myself pain. I just want to cry. Crying is so fucking special! So relaxing you know. Knowing your fucking hopeless. Your body just aching. It’s fucking amaxing. I just want to fucking die. 

And why am I holding myself back. Because I’m scared. Scared of what! What if we weren’t scared of shit! I love my dad and my bonus mom. She really treats me like her own daughter. I love her sm. 

I love my mom but our relationship is so strained. She fucking hates me. I know she loves me but I just- I just can’t with her. She loves her other kids more than me cause I’m fucking annoying. All I do it annoy people! They upright tell me I’m annoying.

I want to live but not at the same time. I just want to fucking cry! Why can’t I fucking cry. I just want someone to beat me to death. Like (ik that’s on some kinky shit) but I just want someone to fucking tell me how worthless I am and tell me no on loves me. So I can finally cry.

Just hit me and stab me. Torture me, man. I’m just fucking tired. I want to finally feel soemthing. Burn me I don’t fucking care. Just soemthing! Fucking put a bullet through my brain I DONT CARE! just a little rant."
879,1,"Hi,  Id like to know if anyone has felt similar to me or has any advice they could give. 

I’m a 22 year old male college student. The past few months have been really rough for me. I have struggled with anxiety for years but only lately has things really started to get a lot worse. Now even when I go out to a bar with my friends i seem to have a panic attack randomly, where i feel like I can’t breath and get light headed.  I have to go sit by myself for like 10-15 minutes to calm down and resume. I only get these while at the bars but I’ve been doing this and having fun for a couple years now so I don’t understand it. 

I’ve been especially depressed lately so that may have something to do with it. I’m going into my last year at university of Georgia with my major being electrical engineering and I’ve maintained a 3.2 gpa. I’ve been told that I’m doing really well but it’s like I don’t care anymore. I just force myself to keep going. I don’t have a passion for anything that I know of and even though I don’t hate my major I just feel so lost. 

I’ve never been in a relationship or romantically close to anyone and thus sometimes I get really lonely. This has always been tough as my anxiety gets in the way along with my terrible self esteem. Part of me has already given up finding anyone to be close with.

The only thing keeping me going is my family and friends. I’d rather rot in a dungeon for the next 50 years than have them go through something bad happening to me. I wish I felt like that about myself but I dread having to live the rest of my life especially if it means working all day and living alone with no passion or purpose. But I’d still rather live with it than cause anyone close to me any more heartache.

Sorry for making it so long I just wanted to give the full picture plus it does feel good. Anything anyone can offer to me is appreciate, thank you. Would really like some advice and or help if anyone has a minute to spare."
880,1,"Hey fam. 

June was one damn hell of a month. Changed medication and it just fucked me up. My work performance, this is how I feel personally, has dropped. Fortunately I have such a good support system, but I HATE it when I fail. Work is the only good thing that’s going on for me and something I take pride in. If I slip, I feel like a fucking failure and a let down.

I gained back MORE than all the weight I lost last year. My laundry is outstanding and I can’t motivate myself to put away the dry load. Sometimes I’m too tired to take a shower or wash my hair. I don’t even wear make up anymore. Everything is so exhausting.

My mom says medication can’t fix things. 

I wish it did. I can’t keep doing this. I can’t. It’s been a month and I’m so close to calling it quits. But I can’t give up.

I hope all of you are going to have a solid month. Feel like shit. No energy."
881,1,"Just something that annoys me.

The whole point of playing a game is to avoid stressful things, but even when I play games I get stressed.

I don't know why, or how I get so invested into games that much to the point where I can't play without getting mentally exhausted from the decisions I have to make.

I play ROBLOX games, because I can talk to people without having to worry about them knowing me. Then I decided to play games around roleplaying.

Now I got attached to having a personal life that I control.

THEN I DECIDED TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND IT ALL WENT DOWNHILL

I CANT RESPOND WITHOUT MAKING PEOPLE FEEL BAD OR SAD OR SOMETHING

ALL THESE THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD WHILE I PLAY ITS LIKE THIS RIGHT  
""WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY WITHOUT MAKING THEM ANGRY""  
""HOW CAN I EXPLAIN MYSELF WITHOUT THEM THINKING THERES SOMETHING WRONG""  
""HOW CAN I ACT LIKE A PERSON IF I CANT EVEN MAINTAIN A CONVERSATION FOR A MINUTE"" I don't know why, but I can't play a game without getting stressed"
882,1,"Let's get straight to the point. Lately, I've been going through a downward spiral and slowly becoming an emotional wreck. I've been emotionally weak, bored with my life, occasionally lazy, and at times triggered and argumentative.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here to seek help, advice, and support. I'm not sure why I've become so easily annoyed, especially when the climate is hot. At times, my mood is shot that anything and everything can trigger my annoyance. My stepfather, mother, and aunts can be loud, combative, and fierce. 

&amp;#x200B;

But when I try to find my happy place, the easiest interruptions can trigger me. For example, I can be in the backyard relaxing. Then, my stepfather comes out and turns on the music and my mood gets shot. In other cases, I can be in the kitchen relaxing trying to sip on my tea, then, my aunt comes in and starts ranting about her dislike with Donald Trump and turns the news on.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong. My family is fun and enjoyable. But at times they can be a **stick up the ass**.

&amp;#x200B;

On social media, I get irritated at times when people become difficult, ignorant, and rude. Either, they say something I dislike or their response is just completely shitty. They simply forget to be human.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to change. But I, honestly, don't know how. Right now, I find ease in depression when I eat food but that's not a good way to resolve these types of issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope someone can be supportive and understanding. I want to try meditation, maybe that would help. Please offer your thoughts, opinions, and bits of advice! :) 

&amp;#x200B;

If you have questions, I'm more than happy to answer them! Why Am I So Easily Annoyed?"
883,1,"Not only do I have to deal with the bullshit of other rude and abusive kids, I have to deal with the bitchy teachers that cant tolerate accidents from kids that aren't their pets for 6 hours. Maybe if you showed me some respect and made my 6 hours in this prison somewhat bearable, I wouldn't joke around and listen to music the damn whole hour. 

Oh, and the good teachers? Thanks for actually caring about my mental and physical health acknowledging that I'm a human fucking being and that I, and others make mistakes. Thank you for caring about my future and potential, rather then meeting your quota and raising numbers on a fucking computer. Thank you School is 6 hours of brain washing and torture"
884,1,At least then maybe I wouldn’t feel like such a fuck up and I would have a more tangible reason to be “lazy” and have zero motivation. not saying that a physical illness would be easier to cope with. I just feel like it would be easier for others to grasp how limited I feel. I sometimes wish I were physically ill.
885,1,"i can’t get out of this depressive state of mind.. 
why do i coup myself in my room, why can’t i be happy without her?

she says she’s sad too but.. how? she’s so happy? i’m in a rut"
886,1,"I've had this question for a while now. I haven't been keeping up with my religion ever since I developed the symptoms, and I was completely normal when I was. But I find it So hard to do anything and I'm starting to think this is all a kind of punishment to push me back closer to what I believe in. So I'm wondering if anyone here is still practicing some sort of religion and if it's helping or not? 

I'm Muslim btw Can religion help?"
887,1,"I started falling into depression 5 years ago. 

My wife decided she wanted to move away from everything we had been building in 6 years of marriage. We had a house in Wisconsin that we fixed up, great neighborhood, ok jobs and getting our degrees. 

She up and says she wants to move. I had a suspicion I should just tell her to leave on her own then. 

Fast forward to a year ago when im dying of heat exhaustion after living in the south for 5 years. I can barely think it is always so hot. I have yet to make friends. I have been separated from my old friends by the move, first to be with my wife, then to the south.  I finally get a job in my new career field, still no new friends. 

Six months ago she tells me she no longer loves me, that I bore her. Of course I'd been trying to adapt to the life my wife wants. I just can't understand southerners. Honestly, people in the south are either a con artist or too stupid to move away from them. I'd love to be proven wrong. 

I just turned 40. I was ready to die. I still think it would be nice. But I found counseling. Nothing great, just an hour each month. I don't even know if I found the right counseling. My counselor suggests I contact an ex girlfriend. 

Is this normal? I figured what could it hurt. 

First ex I contact reminds me that I once loved riding my bike everywhere. So I got a bike. It's way too hot to ride much, but I find a way. 

Second ex tells me about her divorce and how the grieving process is really just what you do. Pick up and keep moving. 

Both wish me well. Both reminded me I was once a lot more than just the guy married to that woman. Encouraged me to exercise and look for a future. Both already found a new guy after their divorces, so not much hope to rekindle old flames. Still nice to know I might not be the asshole in my divorce. My other exes don't hate me. I am incredibly lucky... I think"
888,1,"(i originally wrote this on r/anxiety. I did not have any large warning signs of depression yet but for years now i have constantly been extremely anxious and unhappy. I have respect for people who has it much worse than me)

I have been lonely since after middleschool when we moved to a new town. I had great friends in middleschool and was very social. When we moved to a new town in my freshman year, everything went down hill. In my freshman year i got a terrible nickname and couldn't make any friends because of it and i started spending weekends alone and im in senior year now and nothing has gotten better. My nickname has disappeared though because everyone has forgotten about me and i became the quiet kid in school. My social skills has gone down and i cant even make friends outside my school or keep my old friends and now my mom is constantly telling me how disappointed she is because i cant find a date for prom and she also keeps telling me to get friends to hang out with during holidays as all i have to do with myself during these times is to play video games. 

Over time i have stopped caring and just accepting  that i am lonely and trying to have inner peace with myself but recently my loneliness has hit me harder than ever before. 

You know when you sit and imagine yourself in situations that you'll probably never be in and act it all out in your head.. We all do it. Now i have recently imagined myself with a beautiful girl i love a lot and how my family and everyone sees me being happy with her(yes i know it sounds cringy). She looked like queen margaery from GoT as i fell in love with her while re watching the show and couldn't stop thinking of her(ik its wierd). So while i sat playing games and imaging myself with such a girl i snapped back to reality and realized how little i actually have and how i may probably miss out on this experience of loving someone so much you'll do anything for them and spending time with that person and going places with her and laughing about stupid things.

I am scared that i will never experience this beautiful side of life and never meet someone like this. I also dont experience any love from my family. I might sound ungrateful as i have a mother and father that are still married and i feel extremely guilty for being so ungrateful but i just feel that we never actually speak to one another and i have absolutely no relationship with my dad and i just keep disappointing him and my mother because of my loneliness and tourettes symdrome that they get annoyed at. 

All i want in my life is a loving family. A group of people that i can come home to and forget about everything else. I am anxious that i will just die alone without experiencing this. 

Thank you for reading all the way and sorry for the long text and many off topic information:/ I am constantly in fear and anxiety of never finding someone to love"
889,1,"I've been weak with anxiety lately, especially at night. I feel guilt and shame, and have had a hard time calming down. 

I've been taking Trintellix, which has been effective, but I've been do worried about nausea, I haven't been consistent with it. I've vomited a couple of times on it and it is not pleasant. I'm also on buspirone, which is relatively new, but doesn't seem to change anything. Anxious"

I have decided to end my life on the 1st of August. 

I have severe trust issues so I won’t be able to tell my friends nor my family about this.

My friends &amp; family will probably mourn me, but they will move on.

 Because I am not someone special. I exist only as a background character for someone’s else story, I am merely Villager B.

I may have been a failure my entire life but I will fufill my role as Villager B.

I will fade away from everyone’s memory and finally cease to exist.

Bye my beloved brethren, Soren was never here. I’m going to die soon."
891,1,"I was wondering if anyone could empathise with the feelings of hatred I have towards being a man. I feel like to live as a man you have to have certain amount of confidence and masculinity that I simply don’t have. But there seems to be a catch 22 of these traits being both desirable but if you pursue them then that makes you undesirable for actively wanting to follow the stereotype of the gender. 

I feel like as a man I am already carrying a guilty conscience over my gender and privilege yet by accepting that I am just harming myself more as I already could barely manage to live before starting to hate my very gender.

This isn’t to say I wish I was a woman, I wish I just didn’t exist. Self hatred of gender but not trans"
892,1,"I feel like depression has robbed me of my personality. I don't enjoy anything I used to enjoy. I can't even think about going out with friends even though I used to love going out. I can't write or draw anything. It's like my creativity has just vanished, along with my motivation. I feel like a shell of a person just going through the motions of life. I've been traumatized by bad therapists (not sure if that's the best way to put it) and and slowly losing the will to help myself. I don't want to die but it's getting harder to justify being alive when I don't think I'll ever get my personality back. Lost my personality"

894,1,"I think I don’t want myself to be happy.  All I can think of is the negative, how bad things are and will always be.  I hate myself so much, I hate my life so much, I hate life in general so much.  Nothing will ever be okay for me because I won’t let it be.  It’s like I enjoy being depressed, like the emotional high is addictive.  Every time I feel down I feed into it, hoping I’ll snap and attempt again.  I feel like even though I try so hard, when I have an especially bad episode of depression, any progress I’ve made is just gone.  Like I’m back to square one. 

My ideals of what will make me happy are just unachievable.  A person like me could *never*.  I can’t help what makes me happy, though.  I don’t understand how to fix that.   

I know I want to be dead, but I don’t know if I want to kill my self?  I certainly did at one point, but now I keep thinking of my mother.  I would feel bad because of all she’s done for me and I thank her by killing myself and putting it to waste?  I want to die somehow, though. I’ll never be happy"

But I stopped by my landlord's house and it turn's out I'm getting evicted in two months. Nothing I can do or say they are moving their son into the house. So I have to leave, I can't afford to move anywhere else and will likely end up moving back in with my Mother.

I went to my friends Canada day party right after and got to hear all about their up coming weddings and their new puppies, babies and what ever bull shit they were talking about, it just seems like everything people talk about around me is so disintresting and boring.

I feel like I keep just typing stuff out and erasing it because nobody cares or reads it. And on top of that I broke my glasses and can't afford new ones so I'm walking around with a missing arm on glasses, the piece that broke off is just stabbing me in the side of the head but I can't see with out them so I'm stuck like this.

I thought it was bad before but this is the most lonely and soulcrushing experience of my life. This just proves to me that people love you when you're happy and will ignore you when you have nothing left to offer.

I am a 19 year old white male and I don't see the point of living anymore. I've been alienated and ignored for most of my time in school. All they'd do was shit on me because I was less good looking than them and use me for entertainment. Eventually I dropped out because I couldn't take the sadness and anxiety anymore. 
This period has scarred me so much mentally that I got pannic attacks when going out in public and I am unable to talk to people let alone make friends.
I have been in therapy for years now, I have taken antidepressants which have left me with emotional numbness and PSSD years after taking them. I have done exposure therapy, I have tried everything in my power to change my situation and here I am.

900,1,"Hi guys. I'm struggling with major depression and anxiety disorder. Mornings have been hell recently. Do you get the feeling that ABSOLUTELY NOTHING makes sense, to the point that your body and face, other people's bodies and faces, trees, plants, cars, buildings, thoughts and emotions - they feel like absolutely absurd and lacking any kind meaning? It felt like I was literally  living in hell. Totally  alienated from reality, like everything I used to believe in is dust in the wind. 

What's also scary is that sometimes those horrible mornings happened right after the meaningful evenings, when I felt like I'm getting somewhere and I' m starting to collect my thoughts, emotions and rebuilding my identity. 

Another weird thing is coming back from the hell to reality. Especially the moment when things feel at the same time meaningles and meaningful. The mornings"
901,1,"My parents did everything right. They raised me right. They didnt hesitate to provide for me despite being blue collar lower middle class people. They gave me the love that every child needs and worked their asses off to exhaustion to see me have a shot at life. But I've been dealing with depression and self-loathing for a while now. Everyday I force myself out of bed. I try to find strength I dont have. My chest feels tighter and tighter everyday and I honestly failed to find a reason to live. I considered offing myself multiple times but picturing my parents crying their souls out breaks my heart. I really hope to get out of this mess but I cant do it alone. I dont have close friends and I struggle to create such bonds due to my extreme social anxiety. I tried a couple of therapy sessions but I didnt feel much change. I'm afraid that once my parents die I'm going to join them shortly after.

I know they didn’t invite me because they probably don’t care about me that much or I’m just such a depressing person to be around and they don’t wanna be around that type of energy. I honesly don’t blame them, it’s my fault for isolating myself and ruining my own life. It just sucks knowing that I’m supposed to be enjoying my youth but instead I’m just completely miserable.

904,1,"I made this account to try to vent and address some of my issues during the week. I have recently started attending a mental health professional weekly. It is confirming many of my previous assumptions and while it is helping it is throwing an even bigger wrench into my life. 

I have tried to quit drinking, r/stopdrinking has been unbelievably helpful. It has been moderately successful. I stopped drinking during the week altogether, despite the cravings. 

However I failed today. It’s Monday at 6:30pm. I just left the bar after work. Today was one of the most stressful days in recent months and I needed an exit and so my commitment to not drinking broke. I am so fucking sad. 

I don’t know what issue to address first. The drinking? The depression? The anxiety? The real people issues? 

I started with the drinking because it exacerbated the others. It makes sense to me to start there. But here I am. On a Monday at 6:30pm writing this while half drunk. 

The worst part is that I’m drowning in a puddle of my own making. I’m a professional. I have a successful career. I have no reason to be sad. But I am dying inside. I am losing my fucking mind. 

I noticed that for the past four/five years or so I have been trying to outrun myself and it hasn’t worked, clearly. I had glimpses of this in the past. I had seen the signs of this coming on but I drowned them all out with hobbies and alcohol. And so now we’re here. Half drunk, in the parking lot of a bar writing a post because I can’t find a reason. 

I don’t know what to do. I am a disaster. The worst part is that nobody knows save my therapist and even she does not know the extent to things. I am a depressed, anxious and high functioning alcoholic and I am dying. 

I need to find a way to address this. I can’t continue living this way. I am depressed and I am losing my mind"

I wanna know what it is to be happy and truly content with life and myself. 
I don’t want to kill myself. I tried two years ago but things didn’t go according to plan. I mean I’m kinda glad I didn’t die cause I learned a lot and matured a lot. But I really just wanna end it.

908,1,"Hi everyone. This is my first time posting here so apologies if I do something incorrectly. 

So I’m a 24 year old guy living in the northeast. Ever sense I was a kid I’ve had a very muted outward demeanor. Meaning, I don’t talk much, don’t have a lot of expression and don’t party a lot. I was always kind of okay with it, because I knew that I had a lot of other strengths and I am good at talking one on one. But this past year, it’s been rough. 8-9 months ago, my long time gf and I broke up. One of the reasons was that I didn’t really want to go out and party with her and socialize very regularly like she wanted. At work recently, I’ve been told that I’m too cold and too serious. Sometimes with my friends, I stay so quiet because I don’t feel like I don’t have anything interesting to say but then I get anxious because I feel like they’re confused about why I’m not talking, and thinking that I don’t want to be there. 

 I basically feel dull and boring. I also have chronic depression for which I’m on meds. But I just feel like I’m the most boring person alive and don’t understand why anyone wants to hang out with me. 

But I don’t want to be this way. I want to be interesting and fun and happy. 

How do I start? 

Thanks. How do I break the cycle?"

It's been 3 years since I gave up treatment because my psychiatrist wouldnt listen to me or treat me fairly, I tried for years to find the right medications but my parents and the medication side effects swayed my old psychiatrists diagnosis. I saw my new Dr. last Friday and they had me recount almost everything traumatizing in my life. It was horrible. However they gave me a new diagnosis after finishing the whole process.  I have MDD(severe), agoraphobia (I dont agree with this one my anxiety is over allot of things including a fear of being alone) , and depersonalization disorder. I'm also in remission from my drug ""disorders"". I'm terrified being back with a psychiatrist. I'm scared to be admitted to a behavioral hospital against my will again.

910,1,"I've had depression for as long as I can remember, which actually starts later in early to mid teens and even those years are blurry. I've figured out ways to keep it at a manageable base line for the most part.

Lately though that base line has slipped lower. I've noticed that I'm more apathetic about my life. Like I could take it or leave it. 

Today however has been a real low point. There is something going on in my life that seems like it shouldn't be out of my control and to hear others say I should be able to  achieve it, just makes me feel all that more powerless. 

All day I have been feeling that the lives of the ones I care the most about would be so much better if I wasn't here. If I were gone someone more equipped could step in and make things right. 

I don't know what to do about this thing or about my feelings towards myself. I know what I'm supposed to do. I know what's expected of me, but I don't have the fight in me to get it done.

When nothing you love doing sounds exciting anymore. 

When hobbies are tossed aside.

918,1,"...and you could argue that it is. We all die, but that's not what I'm trying to convey. My whole life I've felt like I'm fighting just to continue. I'm not fighting for survival from the elements or external threats, but from myself and intrusive thoughts that tell me to give up.

I could have the best day of my life, and the moment I lay down at night I tell myself that I'm tired, that it's OK to give up, that people would miss me, but then they'd move on with their lives. Some days I need to lie to myself and say that my death would directly cause the deaths of people I love. I lie and say that people need me. That my friend (who is also dealing with depression) couldn't continue without me. That my mom would be broken, and would wither away. I tell myself the truth that my death would set a bad example for my young niece, who has been battling depression herself.

Then, sometimes after hours of wrestling with thoughts of life vs death, I fall asleep, and the next day is a whole lot brighter, right until I lay down and turn off the lights.

Every night is a battle, if I slip, if I give up even an inch of ground, I'm another inch closer to death. Honestly, I don't know how much longer I can keep fighting. I tell myself that when my mom is gone, when my dogs are gone, maybe then I can rest. Some nights that seems like it's too far off.

I try to be a light in other people's lives. I'm not feeling the light in my own, but if I can brighten their day, encourage them, compliment them, lift them up, then I can maybe drift off to sleep without wondering if I have a purpose in the world anymore.

I know that people love me. I know that I improve the lives of people around me. I can metaphorically be the big spoon and provide comfort and shelter, and reassurance, but some days, i just need a big spoon. I need someone to hold me, and tell me my fight is worth it. 

Growing up, I knew three things, they were just built into me, before I could even understand them. Call them dreams, visions, premonitions, self-fulfilling prophecies, I don't know. What I knew was: I would smoke. I would fall in love with a dark haired, dark eyed woman, and I would die by my own hand.

I started smoking when I was 17. Then I fell in love with a blonde, quit smoking, and wondered if all three things were bunk, but after 10 years things fell apart, she no longer loved me, and I realized that maybe I never loved her the way I thought I did. That maybe I'd been lying to myself to fill a void. Now I smoke again, and have feelings I've never felt before for a dark haired, dark eyed woman, and I wonder if the third thing will happen too.

Some people could read this and assume that I'm suicidal, but I'm not. I'm tired. Every day I fight for my life, I have a will to live, and want to continue. I'm just so tired of fighting. Some days I just want to let this terminal illness win. Life feels like a terminal illness"

6,0,"3 years ago I wouldn't go to the bathroom without my phone primed to call my SO or the emergency number.

I was always kinda anxious-ish as a kid, particularly when it came to my death phobia... I refused to go on a class trip to the museum because there were mummies, I was traumatized by children's adventure movies like huckleberry finn because I hated seeing the skeletons/human remains, cried at 5 years old when I was told I too would die someday.

It all simmered down more or less as I got into my teens then twenties - and I was otherwise 'normal' albeit  a little shy/vigilant for a couple decades... then it all came to a head when I found a guy my age (late 20s) deceased in a public bathroom from natural causes - panic attacks, hypochondriac tendencies, googling heart attack symptoms and generally much more on edge. 

Luckily things have gradually improved with a few hiccups... panic attacks are very few and far between, I've gotten gradually more relaxed about being in a saveable situation should something arise, but I'm still not back to 100%.

The other day I saw I had 4 days off so I decided fuck it, I'll book a last minute trip to budapest! A few days later and here I am, at a bar as I type, drinking local craft beer after being to the outdoor hot spring pools with public changing areas, various restaurants, making small talk, and staying at a hotel - all by myself. 

A lot of my friends do the same and it's no big deal to them but for me it's a milestone in my anxiety management/recovery, I always admired their attitude and fantasised about doing the same but it was of course in an abstract idea of the future without a deadline, and wasn't pressing. 

A few years from not going to poop without emergency services predialed into my phone to a night out in a strange city in a strange country miles from home...

8,0,"Hi guys,

Hope you're all having a happy pre-4th of July, or happy pre-pre-Friday for others outside the US that are reading!

So I've been out of work for about 9 months (6 of which I was in a trade school for). I'm a bit of a job hopper due to what I now believe was anxiety and paranoia of my perceived performance and what others thought of me. Each job I tried to stick out for at least a year, then I'd quit because I thought I wasn't suited for the role, that my boss wished he or she had hired someone else, and that my coworkers thought I was weird and/or unlikable. Outside of traditional social anxiety and paranoia, I had insane performance anxiety that made it impossible to stick around at any of my jobs. Unfortunately the jobs I took required answering phones or performing a task in front of others, and each time I did it (hundreds of times throughout the day), I would get this mini panic attack before-hand followed by intense shame and embarrassment. They were the only types of higher paying jobs I qualified for that didn't require a degree, so felt stuck.

I couldn't take it anymore and quit to go work in a warehouse. I liked how anti-social it was and they seemed to value me despite a few poor performance reviews at first, but I got better and I seemed to shine a bit there. The only issue I had were the hours (inconsistent) and that I worked around a bunch of highschoolers and college students. They all assumed I was a college student too and it was embarrassing when I had to explain I was doing nothing else. I was a few years older than everyone which led me to pursuing a trade so I could feel proud of my job. I also got injured quite a bit there so I don't think my body can handle very physical jobs.

Pursued said trade, dropped almost $10,000 which became non-refundable after a month, and realized after a few months into it that I didn't like it. It required a ton more sales and social interaction than I thought it would, since it's a job that's more hands-on, and I wasn't a natural at it at all. This isn't my social anxiety talking, I was the worst one there. I finished everything last, my performance reviews were awful, they told me towards the end that I would be fired if I performed that way on the job, and they were considering not certifying me at all. They ended up giving me a pity certificate that didn't include a diploma and I was on my way. Applied for a job in that industry and just as I had suspected, they were pushing me to upsell and basically be a receptionist combined with my actual role. I quit after a week and have been jobless since.

I refused to take meds for a long time and tried getting better naturally, but it's been 8 (almost 9) years since I was diagnosed with performance and social anxiety and I finally went on meds yesterday. I'm hoping this helps and would really like to hear others who also have on the job performance anxiety and how you deal with it.

Thanks for reading :) Does anyone else experience performance anxiety on the job?"

14,0,"My ex-bf and I had been together for 4 years. I broke up with him because of my _anxiety_. I had terrible mood swings, I always felt disappointed. I always felt unwanted because of his body language. I broke up with him because of these but I also wanted him to know I wanted change. 

But I feel guilty. I feel like I shouldn't have done that, I shouldn't have broken up with him. I always check his Facebook and Twitter accounts. I feel like he's sad and going through existential crisis because I feel like I made him feel like he's a disappointment. I want to help him get through whatever he's feeling. But again, I'm scared. 

The last time we saw each other, I thought we were fine. I asked him where he was and went to meet him only to see the disappointed look on his face. He left me with his friends so I felt really embarrassed. Later that night, I told him I was sorry. He said he was sorry too because he only felt uncomfortable. I endured it because I wanted to help him. But the whole thing scarred me, I would only cry every time I remember it. We don't talk anymore but I've been throwing signs that I'm available whenever he wants to talk.

15,0,"My girlfriend of 3 years has anxiety. I've known this since we started dating. It's difficult at times, but it's also part of who she is; her over-attention to every relationship she has (friends, family, me) makes her the most caring person I know. Her extreme attention to detail has helped her excel professionally. I could go on... These are all things I love about her.

This summer, I had to relocate for work for 10 weeks. I'll be done this project in 5 weeks, and moving back to our home city shortly thereafter. But these first 5 weeks have been rough. We talk on the phone 2-4 times a day (feels like a lot to me). She randomly gets afraid that I'm going to leave her (every time she hears that a friend/acquaintance is recently single, she freaks out that it could happen to her). We had phone sex last week, and she's all of a sudden freaking out that her parents know about it (they were in another state on vacation when it happened, so this fear is completely irrational).

I've also experienced increased stress over the pass year that has resulted in stomach problems. I've never had stress or stomach problems in my life. While the start of my symptoms coincided with me starting a new job, this job is far less work/stress than my previous job. I believe that her anxiety is contributing to my newly developed stress problems. Every time she freaks out about something, I find myself getting more and more stressed about it, and less able to just blow it off. To compound the anxiety (for both of us) my girlfriend and I had been planning to get engaged this year. All of this stress and anxiety is making me feel uncomfortable with the state of the relationship right now.

My questions for the community:

* How do I explain to my girlfriend (without triggering her anxiety) that her anxiety is causing me stress?
* What can I do to help her anxiety? I'm quite understanding, but I don't want to be a stress ball that she squeezes whenever something goes wrong; I want to help her develop the tools to cope with it her herself.
* How do I deal with my own newly developed stress problems?

Some other random things:

* My girlfriend has been on anxiety medication in the past, but hasn't been on it for the past two years. The drug made her tired, loss of appetite, weight gain, and just not herself. She was fine without the drugs and seen improvement with a healthier lifestyle (sleep, diet, fitness). But, the past 6-9 months have been difficult for me, and last 5 weeks have been rough.
* She has not gone to a therapist since we started dating. She's talked about it before, but I don't believe her current health insurance covers a therapist. My new health plan does have some mental health benefits. I have not yet taken advantage of them, but I fully intend to when I return home next month. Dating someone with anxiety"

18,0,"I was supposed to recieve a parcel form UPS today but its led to me feeling so overwhelmed all because something has gone wrong. When I told my friend they thought I was acting crazy so is it normal for someone with an anxiety disorder that leaves them 99% house bound and unable to talk on phones to get worked up over something like this?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what happened in more detail. I noticed a black van pull up in the lay by outside my house, vans and cars always pull up there but because I was expecting a parcel I got up and started pacing around as I usually do waiting to get the ""alright mate, thank you, see you"" out the way with, but 5 minutes went by and he was still sat there in his van so I thought it must just be a random van, another 5 minuets passed and he drove off, then a few minuets later I was wondering if my delievery was close by so I went on amazon tracking and it said ""Delivery attempt, Stoke GB"" and then right after ""Delivered, Stoke GB"" But I don't live in stoke... Now I start to panic a bit because I don't know what to do and I'm going to have to take action that I'm extremely unconfortable with. I then went outside and forced myself to go into my neigbors yard to see if it was left there by a door but it wasn't, so then I did something that I've never done and kind of feel proud that I pushed myself to do it but I knocked on my neighbors door, there was no answer so I came back in and used the UPS tracking code in UPS's tracker on their site instead and it says ""you may now pickup your package at the listed UPS Access Point"", at first I thought okay well I have done that once before and I know where that is but then I checked the adress of the access point and its somewhere I've never been, I don't know where it is and even if I look on google maps I don't know the layout, I don't know the entrance and whether its obvious or not, its a sports center so I dont know if its going to be busy or anything. So now I'm sat here and I don't know what to do, I'm thinking of just spending another £50 and hoping the next delivery goes better... People don't understand how hard the littlest things can be for someone like me, so now I'm just depressed really, the anxiety has gone down to a much more managable level because I'm not planning on going to pick it up, I'm not depressed because I lost £50, it's because no one understands and the fact that a lot of things people do with little effort are really difficult for me.

I guess this was just a rant really, but like I said I'd like to know if you have simular experiences with deliveries?  


Edit: I looked on google maps, this place doesnt even exsist, I've decided to order another one, anxiety disorders can be expensive. How do you deal with parcel deliveries that go wrong?"

&amp;#x200B;

I have SEVERE dental anxiety, but am at the point that I have made the leap and scheduled an appointment. I told the receptionist of my anxiety, and they booked me in a few hours from now to reduce the time I would have to dwell on the situation. However, my mind and heart rate are racing like crazy. Any suggestions for how to calm myself down and stop all of the ""what if's"" and negative thoughts? Dental Anxiety"
22,0,"I don't know if any of you can relate to this, but ever since I have moved into my house last year I have had to put up with this loud, chav family that live 2 doors down from me. The worst of their behavior is usually during the summer when their kids are screaming or crying at the top of their lungs in the garden and the poor excuse of a Dad shouting 'which one of you shits has taken one of my beers, I swear I'll wrap this belt round your neck' and not to mention their dog barking uncontrolably. 


It is impossible to have a quiet day on my own when all I want to do is sit peacefully in the sun in my garden with no distractions. This family clearly has no respect for the others that live around them and I am surprised that nobody else has confronted them. I'm in a situation where I cannot find a solution to this, I don't necesarily want to complain to them as I don't feel this is the right thing to do as I am scared it may cause more trouble for me as I have seen police visit their house quite regularly. 


What does make me angry about the whole thing is the fact that the kids bike up and down the street hurling abuse to passers by and I 100% think the parents are to blame for this. I am trying to find a solution to not give those horrible neighbors satisfaction that I am stressed out and anxious over their behavior. I would really appreciate some support and advice about this as this can't go on any longer. Bad neighbors"

25,0,"Hey everyone, I have had generalized anxiety, OCD, and agoraphobia essentially since I can remember. There is always something on my mind that I obsess about can sometimes take over my ability to function regularly. I have been coping fairly well with it for a while now and recently graduated college, but for the past few years I've been having these week-month long episodes where I can't stop thinking about how strange it is that we live on a planet just floating in space. It makes me feel so ungrounded, overwhelmed, and helpless. My recent bout was triggered by traveling to Mexico and freaking out how I was so far away from home and thinking about my family on the other side of North America is standing upright in a different direction. I just couldn't shut it off and now my view of the world has become very small and fearful. It's like I turned on something that I can't turn off and it makes me feel so anxious and depressed. I'm not sure if anyone has even had thoughts like this before, but I guess I could mesh them into the ""existential"" category of anxious thoughts. I just want to be able to drive in an open space without overthinking the fact that I am on a huge sphere in the middle of space, and the horizon wouldn't freak me out anymore because it reminds me that this is where/what we are. I hope this sort of makes sense, it honestly is incredibly hard to articulate but it is really bothering me right now. Any words of encouragement, advice, or relevant experience stories would help a ton. Thank y'all :) Thinking about the Earth in space makes me incredibly anxious (possible trigger)"
26,0,"So FYI, Im going to a counselor in a few weeks because something is obviously wrong.

Not too long ago I started talking to 2 girls. One added me on snapchat and the other is a fellow youtuber. Both conversations were advice, talking about their job, etc. Just small talk nothing more. Now my anxiety has led me to believe that even this is cheating because I was doing it without her knowledge.

Well she found out, accused me of cheating and now everything is tense. I know in my head nothing happened. No flirting, no nudes, nothing sexual. They both know I have a girlfriend and I make it clear that I do. ""Oh yeah my gf and I should do that sometime"" ""Oh yeah my gf and I yada yada"" Like I make it clear. These girls know. The one is in a different country and has a bf of her own. Everything is clear.

But I still hid it from her and now naturally she is upset and I totally understand why. Idk if it's from my last relationship? Rooted into my childhood? Idk. All I know is I felt the need to actively hide it from her because I know she does get a little jealous and I just dont want to have to be put into a spot like that. She is the only girl i need to talk to but talking to other people is ok too, my gf knows this and says I shouldve just told her because now it looks fishy. Understandable. I should've. 

I just am scared of losing her and dont want it to be because I am uncomfortable being put into positions like that despite not doing anything morally wrong besides lying. It sucks because I literally screwed myself. If I was sexting or something, sure. But just talking and I was too uncomfortable to let her know? Ugh. The best way I found to deal with avoiding a situation like this is I deactivated my instagram and deleted nearly everyone on snapchat. I know this makes it seem like I'm hiding stuff but I dont care. Whatever keeps me far away from having this happen again because just thinking about it gets me anxious. It's boneheaded but I'm pretty sure I had this problem with my ex as well. Talk to somebody, delete, talk to somebody, delete. Delete all broswer history always. Delete everything. Idk if I dont trust MYSELF or what. ANy talking is cheating? Idk. She talks to guys and idc. I have alot to work on.

&amp;#x200B;

I never had anxiety until now. I'm 25 years old and literally have had a panic attack now and my anxiety is getting out of control. Idk why and I was in denial for so long. I just hope I didnt screw myself.

thank you for listening Why do I feel the need to hide the fact that I have talked to other girls from my gf? VENTING"
27,0,"So, tl;dr my mom lost her job so we no longer have insurance, and worst case scenario I wont be able to use my meds for three months since I'm out of refills and cant afford follow-ups with my doctor.

This is going to be for much longer, so I'm worried about it getting even worse, like I might blackout while cooking or driving and hurt myself. Since theres really not much I can do until I get another insurance plan, does anyone have any tips on how to help ease the withdrawl symptoms?

33,0,"I've been on Prozac for anxiety for over a year now and went to the doctors today so see about switching as I've been feeling anxious over certain things(mainly job related) and he told me that Zoloft was good for anxiety and put my on 50 mg of that. I took my last 20 mg on Prozac today and am starting Zoloft tomorrow. Anyone had luck with anxiety for Zoloft? I went down from 30 to 20 mg for Prozac because I didn't want to be dependent on it and also because I feel I've gained weight from it. Just for clarification, I've gotten my other prescriptions. from people with a specialty on psychiatry at my therapists office but decided to get it from my doctor this time. I'm hoping I'll be okay switching SSRI's immediately. Zoloft"

I was talking to my mum (I’m 16 btw) and we were discussing whether it’d be good to write a journal, to sort of vent and write things down to help me cope. Would this be worth doing and does anyone know from experience if it’s helped them? Also she said “I can read it to see how I can help you” but I don’t know if I’d be comfortable with that.

About 2 months ago i decided to try smoking before practice. I just wanted to try, it helped me calm down a bit before practice. Now i smoke before practice, when i go out with friends, when im home alone. Generaly whenever i can.

I dont smoke a lot. Maybe 3 cigarettes a week. My boyfriend and best friend are trying to get me to stop. But its hard with how much it calms me... I started smoking"
37,0,"Today, someone hit my car when it was parked. My neighbour took a picture of the vehicle and also the vehicle registration. I live opposite a school in a cul de sac, so the driver picked their child up from school and turned around in the cul de sac which is when she hit my car. Luckily enough, the damage to my car is tiny, but what has pissed me off is that she knew she hit my car. My neighbour said that she got out of her car, looked at my car, wiped some of the paint off and drove away. She didn't have the decency to leave a note or to find out who the car belonged to.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the whole week off work, so I am going to wait in my car tomorrow morning and if I see the car, I am going to knock on their door and confront them. The damage is not that bad to claim through insurance, but it will be nice if she offered to pay for it herself. She will probably deny it, but I will just say that we have pictures and my neighbours saw you and that it would have been nice to leave a note to apologising or something. I just want her to know that she hasn't got away with it.  I am shitting myself but it is a step in overcoming my anxiety. I am so sick and tired of brushing things off when I shouldn't be.

38,0,"Hi sorry I tried to keep this short but it was too hard. Basically I’m 23m and have been suffering from something my whole life. I was a hyperactive behaviour problem child, calmed down (held shit in) in high school then fell in a proper depressed state between 17-20 and never seeked any help, I got over the worst of it somehow.  

Now it’s 3 years later and I still hate everything about my life. Despite telling myself I’m better and got over whatever was happening in my later teen years. I struggle talking to anyone. I’ll have one good week and tell myself ‘see it’s fine you’re fine’ but then that’ll be followed by three bad weeks, I self medicate on/off, I can’t socialise with people unless it involves alcohol or work and I’m sick of it.

I’ve been speaking to my old best friend who I pushed out of my life when I was in a bad way. He’s been having problems himself and I think speaking to him has made me realise it’s time to do something about myself. I missed him so much and regret everything I’ve done to him over the years but just him seeking me out to talk about his issues really hit me hard. 

Like wtf am I doing. I dropped out of school, ditched him to go get high with this equally insane girl, deleted him from fb when he tried to reach out and never saw him for years. I fucked up my education and now work in a job I genuinely hate and dread going into everyday. 

Anyway speaking to him has convinced me it’s time to seek help. I was so hyped up for it yesterday and had planned to go tomorrow. Now I don’t think I’m going to go. I haven’t been to a gp since I was 16, I don’t even know how it works. I’m scared to talk about myself and I don’t have a clue what to say. I always hear about people’s shitty experiences. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like if I don’t go tomorrow I’ll never go and I’ll have to continue suffering forever. Or I’ll go and it’ll be horrible and still have to continue suffering. How can I convince myself to go? 

I don’t want to bother my friend with this shit right now because we’re still getting to know each other again and he has a lot going on himself atm.  I’m most certainly not mentioning this to my family and I don’t feel comfortable telling any other friends about this sort of stuff, even though everyone can see there’s something ‘not right’ about me. I just don’t want to feel like this anymore. 

TLDR: basically depressed, some sort of anxiety, etc speaking to old friend made me realise time to get help, hyped myself up but now the day is actually coming to go get help and I can’t do it Talking myself out of going to the doctors"
39,0,"Hi all, anyone with tips on how to control an anxiety attack?
I've been having a really bad time since my ex left me. I was horrible and I cheated on her and flirted with other women to try to calm my anxiety of not being good enough or wanted. My ex talked to a lot of friends, which isn't a problem, but my anxiety was always elevated and set off because my head was telling me people were trying to take her away from me and that I wasn't good enough. I've suffered this my entire life but I've been wearing a mask to try and hide it all, trying to minimise my own issues when I should have been taking them seriously.


I've been having an attack for the past 6 hours now. I can't stop shaking, I just want to be understood, that I didn't do this to hurt her, I didn't want to be that person. I want to be good and repair the damage I made. How do you help control an attack like this? Can't stop shaking."

41,0,"I got my license when I was 16 but was super anxious about driving by myself. What if I got stuck in the middle of the road when the light turned from yellow to red? What if I accidentally got on the highway and couldn't merge properly? What if I pissed off the person behind me and they become aggressive? There were times I got so anxious and shaky that I could not physically move my foot off the acceleration or brake pedal. Obviously I pulled over to safety in those times but it really turned me off from driving. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped driving for a little over 6 years and relied a lot on my boyfriend and family to drive me places. It was a major inconvenience for everyone and I felt so helpless. I couldn't get the jobs I wanted, I couldn't go places alone, and I couldn't even get to my family in case of an emergency. 

A few weeks ago I decided to suck it up and sign up for an adult driving class. I read almost every single review for 3 to 4 local driving schools and found one that seemed to have experience with anxious drivers. My first class was very stressful and I couldn't help but feel like I was disappointing my instructor. We talked about what made me feel most anxious on the road and over the course of several classes we worked on my trouble areas. I now feel more confident but mostly I am proud of myself for taking the classes. They were so worth it and I already feel much more independent. 

There was a period in my life where it literally felt like I was never going to be able to drive but now I am able to drive on the highway and in tight downtown traffic. There are still times when I'm really tense but I try my best to breathe and to relax. I know that if I ever feel too anxious I can go somewhere safe and collect myself. 

I hope my story helps someone else! Despite having severe driving anxiety, I took driving lessons and feel much more confident!"

It seems the door would have to be inside the parking garage. But at first I didn’t realize so I walked to one side of the building where I had seen a fountain peeking over the corner of the building with a few trees. Once I got there i didn’t see a door so I walked down stairs into the parking garage and I saw the door. Immediately for no reason I was having a panic attack. Not about the interview but for some reason just about there being one door and no other exit doors.  I figured it wasn’t worth the panic attack and I didn’t like the layout of the building so I left no sweat.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post but it covers like 6 months of my life,  I guess I'm just kind of throwing it out there and hoping someone who is/was in a similar position understands. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26(M).  Just as some context, I have anxiety induced agoraphobia, there were entire years where I didn't go outside for longer than a few minutes at a time.

I became morbidly obese (275lbs, 5'10)  due to no exercise, the anxiety mixed with the lack of needing to be social in any way just made me eat to feel good because I didn't even care about the next day, I just wanted a short period of feeling good and had no reason to care about my looks because nobody would see me anyway.

I had a bunch of bad habits such as biting my nails/skin, not showering or washing for long periods of time, just generally not taking care of myself.

All of these things made me feel horrible, making me want to not go outside even more, and my anxiety would just raise further, and I'd then right go back to my ""coping mechanism"" of avoiding the problem entirely by pretending I don't exist... And then I'd further my bad habits again and again, each time just reinforcing the loop and making it harder to break out of.

This continued for 6 years, eventually adding up to ""I'll just kill myself if I have to"" being the main thing in my head every day, I'm not sure if I was suicidal, or I had just given up completely. I don't remember wanting to die, but I kind of accepted it as that's what I'd do. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm not religious at all, But I one day came across a random YouTube video on autoplay, and I just listened. 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aFQ5LIOnH4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aFQ5LIOnH4) 

It made me realise, if someone does look down upon me while I'm outside (maybe call me names, or laugh at me, whatever), it reflects horrifically on them, they're a bad person. I don't even want to speak with them ever again, why should I care? It says so much about them, but nothing about me, they'll just be throwing words at me, and I know that means they are dealing with their own problems, so much so they drown in it and throw them at me to try offload some hate.

I started going on this rabbit hole of self help videos, Jordan Peterson was another HUGE help making me realize things. 

One line absolutely slaughtered me when I heard it, I cried hard.

""There's no virtue in being a victim."" 

I was a victim, of myself inflicted depression and a rough early life, but that wouldn't do ANYTHING for me, nobody will ""save"" me, nobody will be able to magically fix it, even if  I pay them, no matter what, being a victim will not help me at all, no circumstances could possibly arise where me being a victim would ever solve this mentality I had that made me perpetually depressed. I was a victim because I was a victim in the past, and that was another endless feedback loop I had to break.

&amp;#x200B;

I  decided I'd start going outside, I bought myself a new pair of jeans..Size 42, I could BARELY fit into them and they were elasticated too, but it felt good to wear ""normal"" clothes for the first time in years.  I paired it with a hoodie, I figured it would ""hide"" the most.

I woke up at 5am and went out around 6AM, I felt insanely anxious the entire time, the night before I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. 

But I went outside, 30 seconds into my journey.. and I felt fine, like totally fine, until I saw other people walking towards me, I didn't even know what I would say because it had been so long. They said ""Good morning"" and I said it back, it felt SO normal, like I was just a normal person and everything was fine, it felt like I was ""faking"" it almost because it was so easy. I didn't even think, it just happened.

I went out the next day, the day after that, sometimes going in different directions, exploring a little. Each time, if I had to say ""Good morning"", it just happened naturally. 

Eventually I went out at a ""normal"" time, like 2PM.  There were cars this time, I had to use the traffic lights and ""deal"" with hundreds of people driving past me, but I didn't even care. 

This is where the ""third agreement"" really helped, I didn't make assumptions, I just walked and they were just driving past. They weren't judging me, because I had no reason to believe they were, there was no proof.  Even if someone did, they never said it to me, so I would never know anyway.

In all my times walking outside, I've never had a bad experience, all my anxieties and worries about people making fun of me never even happened, not even one person was even slightly rude. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started dieting too, working out and lifting weights (at home). Going out for a daily walk added something to a ""routine"", I had an actual **reason** to shower, a **reason** to wear better clothes, a **reason** to keep my diet up because I knew people would see me.

5 Months of this passed, I didn't go out every day, I didn't work out every day, I had some days where I didn't stick to my diet, but I tried to make sure I did at least one of the three in a day so no day was a ""loss"", but at worst a neutral day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started getting courage to go to the local supermarket, it was almost always busy with queues, so I'd often go in the mornings. Eventually I ""got"" it, I just hand them the money, say thank you, place the stuff in a bag and leave. 

Nothing bad ever happened, nobody judged what I was buying, questioned me or said anything. It just went fine every time. I even forgot an item once, I turned around and went back, the same cashier didn't even say anything, I just bought it. In my mind this was like the equivalent of climbing mount Everest. It was like admitting I did something wrong in public, having to admit it to someone, like I'd look stupid in front of everyone. But it didn't really work out that way,  I just had to be a tiny bit vulnerable, but for some reason feeling vulnerable made me feel stronger, like I could admit I was wrong, and that was okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I had to do something bigger though, I had to make myself an appointment in the city, where I'd have to go on the bus, talk to people, give my information, hand over some papers and then actually do the actual appointment, buy something and leave. 

I don't even know how I did this, but I just asked questions. Every single thing I did I asked questions. 

 I asked the bus driver for a single ticket, he told me an all day pass would be cheaper if I'm coming back, I mumbled a ""yeah.."" He said ""what?"" and I said ""yeah that's fine"" and I got an all day pass.

Eventually I arrived in the city like 45 minutes too early, which was lucky because I had no idea where I was going anyway.  But for some reason, with Google maps, it was all so easy? I just looked at the map if I was confused, that was it.  Someone even asked ME for directions, I  had no idea what I was even doing! I just looked it up on my phone and showed them, they said thanks and went off.

 I was trying to walk around with ""confidence"" with my head held high, shoulders back, standing up straight,  so maybe I didn't look lost? I don't know, but it made me feel so good that someone approached me. 

Eventually I sat in the city center for 30 minutes, it was oddly relaxing because others were doing it too, I then went in when they opened, answered all the questions, it wasn't even awkward! I don't get it? My heart the night before was literally about to implode, I had 3 hours of restless and sweaty sleep, I was seriously thinking of cancelling. 

I was a little confused, I asked questions..They just helped me? People were nice, they didn't judge me for being confused, they just helped. Almost like they were happy to help?  I just don't get it, it's like my nightmare to talk to people but for some reason everything is fine when I actually do it, and they're nice and understanding. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got the bus back, it went so well, everything just worked, I showed them my ticket, and got on at the back, checked google maps, got off when I needed to..It just went fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I had to prove to myself it wasn't a one off, I know I'm capable of being somehow magically okay with things when I have to, but I had to prove to myself I could go to the city again by choice. 

The second time I went during the weekend, at 10am, it was very busy. Around 10 people were queued for the bus.

This time went even better, I asked for the all day ticket right away this time, I didn't even feel slightly nervous during any of the trip, in fact I felt confident walking around, I went into a huge shop full of greeters and said hello to them, even the journey back from the busy city center was fine. I did kind of rush home after 45 minutes of exploring, as I had no real purpose to be there..But the main thing was taking the trip there and back.

Everything just felt so much better when I was outside, when I was actually doing it..It was just, easy? All the problems I possibly thought of in my head didn't happen, everything went so smooth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now we get to today, I had decided I didn't really want therapy, I knew therapy would lead to them telling me to go out more, I knew the only way was to just go out. It's just the only solution to my problems. Just meet people, even if it's so awkward I struggle, I just had to do SOMETHING to actually have a conversation with someone. 

I had to be vulnerable, I just had to be open and if someone asked I had to tell them the truth. I needed a place where I could say what I mean, and people would understand that I've had struggles, and I'm just there to try something new.

I decided a church was really the only choice,  I'm not religious, I've never even been to a church properly, I had NO idea what was going to happen. All I knew was I'd be forced outside of my comfort zone, I'd meet new people, I'd probably have to at least have a chat with someone at some point, about anything! Even a 30 second chat where I ask a question is more than I've EVER had with a stranger in the past 6 years of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The people were so welcoming, I mean really they seemed happy to see me, I can't even remember the last time I felt that.

They guided me through everything, were very polite and waited until I got it and let me read and follow along, even if I didn't join in. I was just happy to be experiencing something new.

I ended up having small chats with people, about the obvious things they'd ask (are you religious, what do you know about X) , some asked me about myself so I told them the truth, I was vulnerable and in public, I told them I had anxiety, I told them about some family problems and told them I had problems with my weight.

I was awkward, there was some awkward silences, some ""what sorry?"" times, there were even times I didn't pick up on some non-verbal social cues. But everyone was nice and understanding,  I just asked questions. I let them do most of the talking, and if they asked me a question I responded truthfully.

They even told me about some of their problems, one person said they had to have a surgery recently, another having trouble making friends. It felt nice to know I'm not the only one with problems.

When I was leaving everyone was waving bye, telling me to come again soon. 

I'll go again, hopefully to the Sunday service when there's more people.

I'm actually excited to go outside. I can't believe it.

&amp;#x200B;

Also my current weight is 215lbs down from 275.  I still have a long way to go to fix all of my problems, but this is a start I hope. I'm agoraphobic, I went to church today."
52,0,My anxiety? Has been flaring up horribly lately and I am wondering what could be the cause of it. I seem to worry about a lot of stuff. Such as if I smell today? Or did I forget to take my medication even when I know I did. Even some other things  aswell which I'm embarrassed to mention . It's getting so bad that I have dark thoughts of doing stuff to stop the anxious thoughts. Need someone to discuss stuff with.
53,0," This is a short one, but it happened just now, and I'm freaking out about it.
 
 Something was wrong with my Fitbit app, so I got into a customer service chat to figure out the problem.
  Not even 5 minutes in and I'm already muttering things to myself while I feel my cheeks turn red from embarrassment. The thing was, I didn't even do anything wrong- at least I don't think so...

 I ended the chat before I even knew what the issue was. I ended it so quickly. And now I'm freaking out, embarrassed about the whole situation. I hate getting onto customer service chats like those...or calls with people I don't know in general. 


long story short: I embarrassed myself on a customer service chat, and ended it before I knew what the problem was. Now I'm embarrassed, and needed to share somehow. Got into a customer service chat and embarrassed myself."
54,0,"(First off: I'm currently on 150 mg of Wellbutrin and 150mg of Lamictal, and just recently got back on 5mg of Lexapro. I was hoping to wean off the Lamictal (assuming the Lexapro worked out) since I've always felt that particular med overly ""flattens"" my moods, but I guess I'll have to stay on it for the time being. 

Also, I'm not sure if this is the right sub to ask this question so please let me know if there is a more appropriate subreddit to post this in!)

I used to be on Lexapro a while back and took it for years. Lexapro was a godsend for my social and generalized anxiety but my libido was extremely low so I eventually dropped it. I then switched to Wellbutrin and WOW what a difference!! (I was horny pretty much anytime I wasn't sleeping)

The Wellbutrin and Lamictal are definitely helping with my depression/moods and aren't making my anxiety levels worse, but they also aren't decreasing them, so I got back on 5 mg of Lexapro in hopes that the Wellbutrin would counteract the libido-decreasing effects of the Lexapro. Now my mood and anxiety levels are better than ever but of course the libido is kaput again; I thought 5mg would be low enough of a dose to prevent this but woe is me :/

The thing is, I haven't found any other type of antidepressant save for SSRIs which effectively counter my anxiety. For those who had libido issues on Lexapro (or Zoloft), did you manage to find an SSRI which combated the anxiety while leaving your libido relatively intact? If so, which one? If not SSRIs, did you find any other meds which helped? I've also tried Buspar in the past and didn't notice an effect on libido in either direction, but I also wasn't on Lexapro at the time.

One final note: I'm opposed to taking benzos like Ativan/Xanax due to tolerance/dependence/addiction issues among other things; I get they help a lot of people (and they personally completely kill my anxiety) but please leave them out of the equation.

55,0,Even when I have nothing to do I feel like I'm running out of time. I feel like I'm never going to finish everything and I'm always going to be late and I'll never have enough time. My anxiety makes me feel like I'm constantly against the clock. Constantly running out of time.
56,0,"Anxiety is a combination of two things. 

1) A vibrating sensation in the body

2) A negative thought pattern

When you have these two things you will have the sensation of Anxiety. 

If you only had a negative thought pattern, the thoughts would be much easier to distrupt 

If you only had a vibrating sensation, it might not be pleasant but it wouldn’t be so difficult to deal with. 

I came to this realization while doing meditation. My idea of what Anxiety is."
57,0,"I’ve had dental anxiety for my entire teenage/adult life. Due to that I haven’t been to the dentist in about 7-8 years. I know that sounds terrible and I’ve kicked myself for it everyday.

But alas I have finally gotten to the point where my teeth are in such bad condition that I *need* to see a dentist, I just can’t continue living this way. And as luck would have it I am traveling in a foreign country where they do not speak my native language. 🙃

A teacher at the school I am volunteering for was nice enough to make the call for me, and they were able to get me in tomorrow morning for an appointment! Ahhhh, the anxiety hasn’t fully set in yet, but I’m worried it will when I get to the clinic and the poor doctor who speaks only a little English will be unable to help explain the procedure thoroughly or get overwhelmed if I panic. I am also a little worried about the level of treatment I will get here vs. in my home country (USA), but at this point I don’t really have a choice. My boyfriend is coming with me, so hopefully that will help me feel more comfortable.

Any tips or words of advice? I think I may need a root canal and a crown (which I’ve never had before) or the tooth removed, or I don’t even know. The last dentist appt I went to I was supposed to get a routine filling, but as soon as soon he brought out the needle for the numbing shot I freaked out and bailed. Words of wisdom for someone who suffers from dental anxiety before the dentist?"
58,0,"This is a pointless story, I just wanted to vent out my frustrations, dont expect anything valuble.

Bottom line is, I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, pretty much all my childhood and teenage years and it has almost destroyed me, but managed to fight it off the last couple of years.

I used to be the scared little teenager that didnt really believe I could manage a life for myself, without any help. I couldnt even fathom the idea of taking an exam in school.

Then it all happened for me at once - I put anxiety completely aside, my confidence, that I otherwise only had in my internet persona due to anonymity - to real life.

I aced my exams without being scared, I moved out for myself, I got my drivings license etc. could speak with other people no problems, I finally became a normal person. All by myself. I used to otherwise be dependant on my family.

I felt great. I didnt care about anxiety anymore. I accepted who I am, and that's how my self-esteem got higher, my confidence got higher, I believed in myself and who I can become, what my potentials really are in this world, and with all those things combined, anxiety goes away.

Then it happened.. the thing that I feared. Losing control over my progress.

I started having a major crush on some girl I went to school with, and that put my control completely off. I started feeling the anxiety all over again. How am I supposed to talk to her, tell her what I feel, am I expecting a relationship now? etc etc. all this started going through my head, and before I know it.. I'm back to having those damned heart pumping anxiety attacks.

Feeling that kind of love towards a girl, made me lose all common sense and rationality.

Then my confidence came down. Then my self-esteem got butchered. She is definitely a tad above my league, or maybe I just overestimate her looks because I have a crush. (probably). but when you consider someone to be way prettier than you deserve, it automatically makes self-esteem to go down to shit.

Anyways, at some party where all my chances were, I botched them completely and ended up doing nothing, not even say goodbye even though I'm not going to see her again, because I was scared of the entire situation. I was scared of getting embarrassed. I had anxiety. Again.

Prior to that party + while it was going, we were texting almost all the time. I dont know if she knew I liked her, but I wasnt really good at hiding it either, she must have known something atleast.

A couple of days after the party, I fought through anxiety, and decided to confess that I liked her. But it was over text. Yeah... so she did not respond whatsoever, basically disappeard. Probably never cared for me in the first place - and thats fine. It's understandable, because girls mostly likes confidence. And I was confident when I met her, and that's what made me get her number in the first place, but when anxiety kicked in, that's where I got fucked. 

Either way, I can move on from her.

But what I can't seem to move on from is how much this situation has killed off what I thought I was.

It made me realise, that no matter how far I've come in my life, I thought I had cured my anxiety... it came crawling back, when I actually needed it to be gone. That one girl managed to make me second guess myself and hate myself.

Atleast I still have my progress in life. I still dont feel dependant on anyone else to be able to live day-to-day... but I would be lying, if I said this didnt take a hit on me, after anxiety basically fucked me up, once again.

Oh well... lesson learned, the hard way. If there is a next time, I'll make sure to fight through this garbage to actually get things done and not let it waste further of my life and time and happiness.

Oh you women just had to ruin it with your prettiness. My anxiety is highly linked to my confidence and self-esteem. I fought it off, but one girl (or love?) ruined it all again."

Before I go onto my small victory I just want to explain why this mean a lot to me. I’ll keep it brief. In the last year I’ve realised my mother has many issues being entitled and a spoiled brat. In the last few years she’s gradually treating me worse and worse (keeping details of it out. It’s not great but you can get an idea from previous posts on reddit)


Almost a month ago I finally left in a very very bad mental state. Moved in with my partner and his family. Been struggling to do basic stuff. Not fun as I guess a lot would know. 

Today I managed to leave the bedroom, put some laundry on, make toast and eat it in the kitchen and be around a father figure with a only mild panic (again no details but I struggle to be around certain men due to past). 

I know it’s daft but I’m so happy I did it today after this last month of heck. Plus my partners family dog was a massive help, he’s a very good boy that really helps me by being there (just a companion dog, not trained for service to be clear)

60,0,"Hello. I'm currently under anxiety treatment that consists of half paroxetine, escitalopram, melatonin and SOS clonazepam. I haven't had a crisis in a long while now but—exclusively while driving—the shortage of breath and facial paresthesia (and sometimes neck tension) are symptoms that I haven't entirely get rid of. Driving has become tiring because of the paused breathing exercises I have to do to prevent a crisis. BTW I have to point out that I don't have a trauma involving traffic or anything like road rage.

61,0,"I’m on a family vacation and as usual it’s turning out to be more stressful than fun. Everything I do my cousins or grandparents or uncles make fun of. If I’m not talkative enough they get mad and think I’m upset. If I talk a lot, no one pays any attention or talks over me. 

If I don’t help clean up fast enough, I’m lazy. If I start cleaning up, I’m not letting people enjoy their meal. It’s just impossible to win. It makes me so anxious and constantly worried about displeasing someone.

Havent heard anything since and everyone has been normal it seems though not sure, im getting paranoid.

This was saturday. Havent heard anything about it. And since im contracted, im at will and figured id have been cut already.

I can’t do anything right and I’ve been trying to accomplish this experiment over the past few months.

I should be done with this position by August, but the stress I feel from the professionalism in academia and how I think I annoy my boss has been weighing down on me. Plus, I spend a lot of time waiting for my experiments and it makes me feel useless.

Whenever we do anything for my birthday, I insist that they don't sing to me and most of my family already understands. 

But I'm in my early 30's now and still to this day I get really anxious when I'm being spoken about when other people are around, especially peers. For example, the other day we had someone join us in our weekly meeting. Everyone went around the table to introduce themselves and what they do and when it came my turn, I quickly and dryly explained what I did for the company. My boss was in the room and she was sitting to my left and said ""That's not all that you do! You do this and this and that..."" and then everyone in the room went around and said other things that I did (I'm in a support role for a 200+ person organization). I literally wanted to cry because I was so embarrassed. But everything they said were good things and I feel like I should have felt proud. I just never knew they noticed that I do all the things they mentioned.

How and why do I feel like this? 

My role isn't customer-facing, but I don't have issues meeting people and I do well in my role with managing lots of projects. It's just when I'm in a group setting and I'm being talked about that I start to freak out.

Now  I'm back home. I went to see my psych doctor. I've told her I've smoked pot before and taken mushrooms a couple of times. She won't give me back my anxiety medication because she said ""it's addictive"". I told her I have no criminal history and have never been hooked on drugs, and that people take up to 20mg a day of it. I asked her why she'd change a dose that was working for me. I couldn't get a response from her.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do because I don't have the time and money to visit a bunch of psychiatrists, to find one that is willing to give me back my 3mg dose of Klonopin. I don't know if there is some way I can explain the situation to one and say ""look, this is what happened. This is the drug that helped me. I've tried 15 different drugs for 9 years. I used to use pot in college but have only used it twice in the past few years, and I drink maybe 3 times a year. I'm not a drug addict. I don't have a criminal background. When I was on 3mg the constant state of anxiety stopped and people started treating me differently when I didn't have constant nervous twitches or a scared look on my face. I was actually starting to feel happy for the first time in a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I find a psychiatrist that is willing to give me the dose back that's worked for me? Do I disclose my previous medical history to them? I can't afford to uber back and forth and window shop, I'm trying to buy a car or get a job with close-by apartments and move out. Is the only way to talk with a psychiatrist by paying them for an appointment and meeting up with them first?

&amp;#x200B;

My gut instinct is telling me that she's either keeping me on the 2mg because she doesn't want to take responsibility/lose her license if something happens to me while I'm on 3mg, or the fact that pot showed up in my drug test at the hospital because I had smoked for the first time in a year and a half so she considers me a 'drug abuser' now and thinks the Klonopin is just another way for me to get high. Advice on getting my meds back? (Dropped from 3MG to 2MG of Klonopin after psych ward stay)"
80,0,"So, for my whole life I've always had a LOT of anxiety about eating alone, going to the movies alone, traveling places I've never been before alone, etc. But since I started going to therapy and confronting my anxiety disorder instead of ignoring it I've been able to make little steps of progress with all those things! 

I just got back from a week long trip to visit my friend up in Pittsburg and traveled alone there and back. I even sat myself down at a bar on my way home, ordered a couple glasses of wine while I waited for my flight and talked to other travelers. (I even got to share this amazingly delicious flatbread with someone who couldn't eat it all by themself.)

And today I bought myself a movie ticket to see the new Spiderman movie tomorrow just me, myself, and I because I want to see it and no one else I know does so I said screw it!

I feel like... I'm finally discovering who I am and am growing to love myself and these are incredibly small things in the grand scheme of my life, but they feel like huge victories too. I'm just having a good day today and wanted to share because it's taken almost two years of hard work to get here and I'm fucking proud of myself. I'm finally starting to feel like I'm managing my anxiety instead of letting it control me."

But earlier when I was alone, I started getting somewhat anxious and was having a harder time distracting myself from it.

83,0,For the past year I’ve been struggling with constantly overthinking things. I think about things that haven’t happened yet creating scenarios for what could happen or I think about things that already happen and read really far into what someone said as a passing comment or a joke. After awhile it really gets to me and has caused a few other issues in my life. To me I would say overthinking causes me a lot of stress which leads to being nervous and stops me from doing things I want to do. But is simply overthinking things a form of anxiety or is it something else entirely. Is this really anxiety
84,0,"I wrote this short story and it's pretty special to me because I'm am going through this... 

I wake up with a scream, sweat seeping through my sheets, “great, another nightmare” I say to myself. The 162nd to be exact, I have the same bloody dream every night and it’s so terrifying, that the so-called ‘tough’ person that I am is genuinely scared to go to sleep at night. I have tried to do all nighters but the nightmare always finds its way back into my brain to show me the horrifying sights I refuse to talk to anyone about. I didn’t use to be like this, scared, I mean. Scared to go to sleep, Scared to go outside, scared to do anything really. I am alone, well sort of, and it’s all because of it! I’m not actually sure what to call it now that I'm thinking. These past months everywhere I go, there it is, following me. The only place where I feel safe is in my home, but then it’s time to sleep and it haunts me again. Those beady black eyes, That grey fur that covers its insanely large body, and those arms, those long arms that drag behind it leaving a trail everywhere it goes.

Today’s the first day back to school, day 185. I packed my bag, got my uniform on and I'm as ready as I'll ever be. With a deep breath, I opened the door and make my way out. It’s a beautiful spring morning, there are lots of flowers in the gardens as I walk down the path. Scrape, Children are running to catch the bus. Scrape, Scrape, the birds are singing. Scrape, Scrape, Scrape, it’s coming… I can hear it. Scrape, ScrApe, ScRaPe SCRAPE. I can feel it, Its heat radiating, It’s weight pressing down on me. I’m frozen on the spot, I’m scared… what do I do?! I can’t keep going on like this, It’s exhausting. I know that if I want this all to stop then I have to deal with the situation. I feel my bones turn to steel. There’s only one way to stop this. I take a deep breath and turn around and look it right in the eyes. Huh, it isn’t as big as I thought it was and that grey fur that haunted my sleep is actually quite soft and fluffy. I’m just starting to wonder what it was I was so scared about. It steps forward and wraps its arms around me. Maybe we could be friends and rather then running, we could work together. I am going to call you Anxiety. The monster in my dreams (PLS READ)"

Once they say this, my brain totally goes into an anxious overdrive and all I can think about is not moving. However this has the exact opposite effect of what I want to achieve and my legs start trembling (sort of like how it is in extreme cold) automatically. Two or three times I've deliberately forgone sleep before my radiation so I'll be too tired to think of moving (or not moving) but even that didn't work. Holding my breath seems to half work but since the process is 5 minutes long I end up trembling anyway.

92,0,"I’ve dealt with an anxiety disorder since middle school and unfortunately it impacts a lot of areas of my life. Certain things are triggers, including money, and from that, my job. For whatever reason, money really triggers my anxiety. Making it, spending it, budgeting. I’ve always been a penny pincher, mainly because my mom instilled it in me. My parents never exactly showed away from making their issues known to us as kids, so I heard all about money problems and stuff as a kid. When I was in college, my dad was laid off. My mom had been laid off years before, but we were going off of my dads paycheck. So with no income, things were tight as my parents looked for jobs. My sister was in grad school, and my mom would tell me that I would potentially have to drop out of college and work full time to support the family. On top of other issues that made things worse. 

I’ve loosened up a lot since then, but it’s still a huge stressor for me. I’m still a bit of a penny pincher, but it’s gotten better. I was laid off of my last job, and unfortunately the area I live in has virtually no job market for my field, so I had to take a job with a $13k paycut. My monthly pay changes based on how many field jobs I can snag, as I get extra money for that. So that also seriously puts me into anxiety mode, because I have to struggle against jerky coworkers just to make decent pay. The pay cut and having to constantly fight for decent pay gives me nonstop anxiety. I know I’m in a decent financial position (I’m 26 and have about $36k saved), but it’s still an issue for me and I constantly feel like I’m in dire straits. Anyone else in a similar position? Does anyone else have money related anxiety?"

So this kinda starts from when I smoked weed in highschool. I'm 24 now, but at 15-17 I smoked weed, spice, and eventually salvia. After the salvia I couldnt smoke weed without having a severe panic attack that lasted for idk how long. I smoked cigs to calm me down (doesnt help really) and went to a counselor. That actually really helped cause my anxiety gave me somewhat agoraphobia so getting out of the house was nice. I started taking medication (4mg of alprazolam extended release.) I dont abuse the pills. What I do is abuse alcohol. It seems to be the only thing that ""cancels"" my anxiety. I know I've been doing am idiotic thing and I want to not rely on alcohol to fix my issue. I mean I carry a flask everywhere i go just in case. I feel shitty that I'm self medicating. Idk if anyone else has had a similar situation but if you have, what would you say is the best way to lean off the alcohol?

There’s this apartment that I pass by whenever I walk my dogs. Their windows are usually open when I walk by so they can see everything outside. I stopped to pull my dogs away from their little area of plants, since he decided that would be the perfect place to pee, and we accidentally made eye-contact. This guy is an adult male, clearly has a job (and what I later learned a motorcycle), and has his own life going on. Yet since that day I’ve made a conscious effort to avoid being seen from his window, even so far as to walk in the middle of the street or quickly run past when I think he isn’t looking. 

I don’t know this guy but we saw each other on a daily basis, and each time made me so anxiety ridden that I nearly broke out into a run because the classic “oh god he saw me” string of thoughts run through. Not to mention, I wear a bonnet in the early morning. It looks absolutely stupid on me because it’s too big but I have no other option. 

Also, I’m one of those people that whenever I’m put through something stressful, I talk to myself and recite all the things I could’ve said and all the points I could’ve made. It’s weird, but it’s a form of stress relief for me since the squirrel on my tree seems more interested in my life problems than others are. A few mornings ago I had a really rough start to my day, so as I was walking my dogs I started talking to myself. I look behind me out of habit and lo and behold, random guy is there walking behind me trying to get into his own place. Needless to say I bolted, and now Random Guy knows that I talk to myself an probably thinks I’m crazy. 

I don’t know what to do, or how to stop feeling so much Anxiety because I’m worried about what this one particular stranger thinks of me. I’m not normally this bad, and I typically get along with strangers. But this one person I just never want to see me, and I never want to look at him. 

If anyone knows what I could do to maybe ease this anxiety or get rid of it entirely, I would really appreciate if you could help me at all.

td;lr: I’m so worried about a person I’ve never met’s opinion about me that I’m actively avoiding contact and their sightline, including their window. Does anybody feel like you’re constantly being judged by a person, even if you don’t know them?"

111,0,"I have been suffering from anxiety for roughly 18 months I believe it is linked to me giving up on weed after 6 years of heavy daily use. Last six months have been spent trying to find more healthy and better coping mechanisms. Fast forward to today. After many hiccups and bumps along the way. Two weeks ago I had a panic/anxiety attack and was signed off by my doctor for 2 weeks. And now I'm anxious about going back. Current coping mechanisms I am using are meditation and cbd oil. Tbh I'm ok today but returning to work is worrying me. This is my second attack in the last 8 months. Second time i was signed off for two weeks the only difference is last time i was at a different work place. And stupidly never took it to not come across as ""weak"". Ego shit. Accepting what I have I believe is the hardest part simply cus there's nobody to talk to. When I'm good. I'm energetic. I'm fun to be around. Fairly chatty. But when I'm in my depressed state..i just hate life. Nothing excites me. Don't care for anyone. I constant thoughts about death ring through my mind on a loop. I know its all my ego telling me that they the things i love no longer excite me. I've read and watched so much on cures for depression and anxiety. So I'm very aware of my conscious vs subconscious internal battles. Just hard man.

  


Guess I am just writing this seeking some form of advice or some form of information. Please help me. I just wanna cope. Be like before you know Return to work"
112,0,"Little backstory of why I’m so afraid of cancer. My great aunt died of stage 4 brain cancer, my dog died of brain cancer when he was otherwise perfectly healthy. Many of my friends loved ones have died of or experienced cancer. I’ve been to a therapist and that’s helped me in the past, but my therapist got diagnosed with cancer.


Lately I’ve been absolutely convinced I have cancer. I’ve convinced myself without actually having any symptoms, other than an uncomfortablility with my scrotum. Now I’ve been listening to my friends make plans in the future and I’ve been sadly sitting there and thinking I won’t be there. And it’s not suicide, Ice just convinced myself I’m dying of some undiagnosed cancer. And it’s not a suicide thing either, it’s just a “oh I’m gonna die of this cancer and will never experience things that I want to experience.” Feeling.  It’s like a dread feeling but also a longing feeling. And there’s an 95% chance I’m perfectly fine! I have no idea what to do about this feeling, but I want to experience life without thinking I’ll never see these things again because I’m dying of some random cancer

The funny part is I don’t know what cancer feels like it, but from what I understand the pain doesn’t go away when you’re distracted. It doesn’t go away when you’re happy or when you get a massage. I know deep down there’s nothing wrong with me. But I’m fighting two wolves where one is saying I’m dying, while the other one is telling me to listen to logic, and common sense. 

I don’t know who to go to, since all my family is pretty poor and chalks everything up to stress and anxiety, which is 90% of my life. But since those 2 variables exist, I probably won’t be getting an mri or however they identify cancer anytime soon, further adding to my “coping with death while not dying” Different kind of anxiety"

I've known for about two years that I have anxiety (before that I didn't know everyone enjoyed a more calm and normal lifestyle). 

But these are the irrational anxious thoughts I have everyday:

Am I spending my waking hours making the most effective choices, as if eating lunch at 11 or 12 matters. I should've spent my time being more productive. I could've started three new healthy habits today, but instead I just got by. What's wrong with my me. I'm wasting my time. 

Why do I have no energy. Am I anemic. Why didn't I use that money to buy vitamins today. I'm so stupid for prioritizing my wants over needs. Such an idiot. 

Am I slowly screwing up friendships because of lack of communication. Is it all just downhill from me and irreparable. Why bother. I feel like a fake for contacting old friends. I will make the same mistake again in the future. 

Am I spending too much money on X, Y or Z (even when I have all my money budgeted and it's not possible to overspend). You're a fucking idiot when it comes to money. You always do it wrong and you will never be ahead of the game. 



Everyday. And I never feel content. I will even block out things that I need to do and pretend they don't exist for just a bit so I can pretend to feel good about my situation and choices. 

I used to think I had such high confidence, and I realize the negative self talk I put on myself all day now. It's awful. I hate it. And I hate myself for doing it. But it doesn't stop. 

Is this all just anxiety? Is it all related to anxiety?"

Secondly, GENETIC TESTING! Now I know why my other meds weren’t working! I don’t take to SSRIs well AT ALL. Basically, they mess with me big time and I finally have validation considering I was on 3 different ones. 🤦🏼‍♀️

I have this huge list from GenoMind. I’m super stoked. I’m going to dig around more and talk to her more about it all.

So, if you haven’t done genetic testing and can, you totally should. This not only has SSRIs on it, it’s got how you would respond to OTC meds as well. It’s really enlightening.

125,0,"If I can help even one person with my post, or just find someone who can relate, I'll feel accomplished for the evening.

Anyone who's actually overcome their battle (well.. do you ever really?) is probably laughing at my naivety and recalling a time when they may have felt the same way. 

I'm an early 20s male for context. Yet I eel like a child still. Afraid I always will...

I've had dark moments. The darkest was certainly collapsing on the sidewalk of a road that crossed over a small stream, feeling embarassed and invisible as cars drove by in the night. I was leaning against a short wall of concrete made cold by the wintery night, feeling the frostbite consume my ungloved hands, as I called my friends crying that I felt like jumping over or just staying there and waiting for hypothermia to claim me. 

A few weeks later, they briefly stopped communicating with me citing the overwhelming pressure of being my only outlet. Was it the best way? I don't think. It will forever hurt not having friends for a month. But it's been three months since, and I just hung out with them yesterday. Had a lot of fun for half the day. Was feeling normal. Was feeling that *they* thought I was normal. Was feeling like one of the guys. I love my friends and always will. Then one of them made a comment about a hang out they had while not speaking with me. Instant mood shifter (I thought I had that shit normalized). 

I shut down for the rest of the night. Became a recluse. I guess I was waiting for someone to just hug me and tell me it was gonna be okay. I always am waiting for that. I get the feeling I'll be waiting 10 lifetimes.

Ended up crying in front of one friend at the end of the night. Some jazz about nobody loving me, about how I'll never be loved by anybody, and how I'm pathetic. Looking back on it, hey, I feel pathetic! Was clearly afraid that this would show them that I actually hadn't made any progress and that I couldn't be trusted to not have a breakdown and make them feel uncomfortable...feel the pressure to turn my day around like always.

My friend told me there was nothing to fix. Not to dwell on this. And next time is a clean slate. Then he gave me a hug (with a small prompt; a few minutes after I suggested a slew of things that would make me feel better). He gently rubbed my shoulder. I don't know why, but that small detail is engrained in my head, and has helped calm me down all of today. I felt so connected to him right then. And most importantly, I felt loved without the words having to be said. Is that just my own wild interpretation? Does it matter? I felt it. I felt like someone who mattered.

Yeah, I had a setback. But it hasn't ruined everything. And I'm still going. 

I'll have more setbacks. But I'll keep going. And so will you, wherever you are. I'll send you a virtual hug if you need it. Realizing this is a much longer journey than I was hoping it would be"
126,0,"The Talos Principal is in the PlayStation 4 humble bundle sale and I’d highly recommend it. For $8.88 you get that plus a few other games but The Talos Principal is the steal. 

I didn’t expect much when I rented it but it’s just so...calming. It can be a bit frustrating when playing when you’re stuck on a puzzle. However, don’t feel too bad if you have to look up the occasional puzzle.

There is sorta a dystopian? Vibe to it but it really is calming. It’s the perfect game to put on a background noise video to and just relax. 

Braid and What Remains of Edith Finch are also somewhat calm games. However they’re very emotionally draining so only go for them if you’re looking for that.

127,0,"I don't know if this have ever happened to you. Have you ever felt all alone in this world with no one to talk to? You know no one will be able to help you. You cant help yourself because your anxiety is taking over your life. You push everyone away. Surprisingly, caring too much is extremely annoying to everyone around you.

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much going on in your head and so much you want to say but you always think whatever you say is going to be the wrong thing. Your anxiety and the art of your mind of twisting things and worrying you  before anything comes out does such great wonders that even the people who are supposed to be your support system cannot take it anymore and they give up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Family is just a shit show. No support from that area. Actually weirdly enough, you are their support system so there's that. Job sucks so bad every single day, you want to quit but you cannot because if you do, you wont be able to support your family for what they need.

You are obviously not capable enough to live on your own because duh u can not hold any friends  of your own and the only friends u have are your support system. It is understandable that they did not sign up for this and they do not need your shit so you decide to just back away and let them be but what will you do now?

&amp;#x200B;

Someone might say, ""Then why won't you try to find a partner?"" , "" If you have such an issue with staying alone, you should just go out and look for friends. "", "" Ohh, you are so upbeat and social when you are in a public capacity  but when it comes to your personal life you always say that you didn't know what to say  make an ""excuse"" that its your social anxiety."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Who will go and explain to them that in a public capacity, you know you are not going to meet that person again and so anything you say or do will not affect your standing with them and neither do you care. It's the people you care about, the people you like and want them to like you back that you worry yourself over. 

&amp;#x200B;

The more you care about or feel close to a person,  the more your head starts worrying and getting paranoid. At that point, worrying just becomes a vicious cycle and 90% of the time, you  end up doing the exact thing you intended to avoid and worried so much in trying to figure out a way on how to prevent. Something as small as a sneeze ends up in a full blown flu and you end up losing them. 

&amp;#x200B;

How many times, you must have heard "" stop playing the victim"" , "" stop making excuses and just take responsibility for your actions for once"", "" you need to learn how to talk you cant always make the same excuse"".  For everyone around, you are just a big fat liar who is flaky and fickle. 

&amp;#x200B;

People never believe you when you say that your intentions were pure and there was no malice behind them. But then again, why would they? It's not like this is the first time you have said something that completely voids the person you are otherwise.  Time and again, you have done and said things to hurt them or show them that you are not who you say you are. You are just a hoax.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all you have now finally pulled the last straw and the only kinda like a support system you had is also fed up and refuses to acknowledge you as anyone to them. They wont say it but you know its over. You cant go to them for support anymore. No family, no friends, no abilities of making any more friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

No loved ones whatsoever. This is your life and you have to still support the minds of three individuals namely your family. They should not find out what you are going through. 

&amp;#x200B;

So you lost them too. Only if you could tell them how much you actually loved them for being who they are and for what they do for you without sounding extremely creepy and weird , things might get better. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Now what do you do????????? If anyone has answers to any of these questions please help."

I've tried breathing, I've tried holding my arms up and smiling, I tried calmly thinking ""Everything is okay"" repeatedly, I tried sex (worked for like ten minutes after then it came back harder), counting isn't really an option for me, used to try it when I was little and it never helped. 

I tried to at least slow my heart with my eyes closed for at least half an hour before reaching the point where I had to get out of bed as the shaking was keeping my boyfriend up.

It’s the middle of summer, so I don’t have schoolwork, and I don’t have anything scheduled all week.

132,0,"Backstory: I (23F) have GAD, OCD, and depression. I’ve been on medication since college, which has led to me living a basically normal life.

I got engaged a few months ago, and my fiancé (23M)’s parents are making life very hard for us. They don’t like me and have been interfering in our relationship in various ways. First they tried to convince him not to marry me, and insisted he should go to my doctor to hear from the source about my mental illness, symptoms, treatment plan, etc. They claim they’ve now given up on that and want to come to our wedding, but are trying to emotionally blackmail us into moving the wedding date. Whenever we talk to them, they yell and verbally/emotionally abuse us.

When they were demanding my medical history, I experienced a new level of anxiety. I felt as though I wasn’t breathing properly whenever I thought about them and the stress they were putting us through. It was almost like I forgot to breathe, or forgot to breathe deeply enough. It would give me an instant headache and make my heart race.

Eventually this led to my first ever panic attack, which was mild but enough to convince me to take a step back and take better care of myself. I went to the doctor, described how my breathing was fucky and my heart was racing (my pulse was 123 at the doctor’s, sitting still) and he prescribed me beta blockers. They’re great and have helped to ease my anxiety, but despite lowering our contact with my fiancé’s parents and a couple months passing since the first incident, my breathing problem has not gone away. It’s no longer tied to thinking about his parents, and is now something that just happens to me at least once a day with no discernible trigger. I breathe deeply and try to relax, and it eventually goes away, but it doesn’t help much in the moment.

136,0,"Hi there, I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember (I’m mid 20’s currently). It has definitely ebbed and flowed for my whole life, and was at its worst a couple of years ago. Luckily I got the severe panic attacks and other terrible symptoms under control with the help of therapy and meds. I’m doing pretty well these days but the anxiety definitely spikes in stressful situations, although not at all as bad as it was a couple years ago. 

Anyway, I have cried super easily my whole life and I hate it. It’s mostly the fact that I tear up when my feelings are hurt that really bothers me. I don’t mean someone being super rude to me or anything like that, but I tend to tear up even if someone just takes a snippy tone with me or gives me criticism. I have no problem taking ownership for mistakes or anything, but it definitely ignited some panicking for me. For example when I was a kid, I would tear up if a teacher simply just shushed me or told me to stop doing something, even if they weren’t yelling or taking an aggressive tone. I don’t think something quite that minor would make me tear up now, but I still tear up very easily in similar situations. Like if I’m at work and I’m made to feel like I made a mistake or someone takes an unkind tone, I can’t help but have my eyes well up and I just feel awful and tend to keep thinking about the situation. 

It really bothers me because the more rational part of my brain will tell me that it’s ok, you can’t control how other people feel or react, their attitude is not my fault, take this as a learning experience, etc etc. It just makes me SO anxious and I tear up.  It’s a stupid physical response I can’t help. My face gets hot and my heart pounds and I just feel awful and my eyes well up. 

I just started working at a new job and I deal with people much more than I have in my previous roles. I’ve only really encountered a rude person (a client) one time so far and teared up a little but it went away pretty quickly because I luckily have 2 really supportive coworkers that told me the rude person has been rude to them many times before and is just like that and not to worry about it. However, I certainly dwelled on it all day and still am because it’s the reason for this post.

I know that these particular coworkers won’t always be by me in these situations and certainly not if it isn’t something work related. I really want to know if anyone else has gone through this and if there are any tips to deal with this better instead of instantly feeling shitty and having my eyes water. It’s super embarrassing when people notice it and I feel like it just makes me seem like a huge baby and I don’t want people to walk on eggshells around me or be afraid of offending me. Does anyone have any advice? Tips on how to not cry easily?"

Needless to say, I’ve started to dip my toes into the dating world through various apps and such (which makes it much easier thankfully). However, I was wondering if anyone has tips for handling anxiety when it comes to the actual dating part of it. I went on a date with a guy last week and I couldn’t have been more tense. I felt nauseous and anxious the whole time. The guy was great, I just wish I could have enjoyed it more.

I’m no doubt excited for this new portion of my life &amp; I have many things to look forward to, I am also filled with some remorse, perhaps guilt, as I will be leaving my single parent alone. They have raised me since my other parent’s passing years ago. We have a very close bond as a result of this. They are highly accepting of my choices &amp; have always tried to empower my independence. Throughout dark times in my life, my parent has been my only guide. At times I feel I am almost doing a disservice by leaving them. There are many things I wish I could repay them for throughout the course of my life &amp; I worry I won’t be able to do it. I worry they will not have someone to remind them to care for themselves. I know I sound ridiculous as we are both functional adults.

147,0,"Does anyone have any tips on overcoming anxiety about being in a bathing suit in public or about overcoming body dysmorphia? I believe I suffer from body dysmorphia primarily as a result of living in Los Angeles surrounded by impossible (and surgically altered) beauty standards as well as social media always shoving highly curated accounts of perfect looking women in our faces.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been the most confident person ever, but lately, it seems to be getting worse. I'm not sure if I've actually gained weight since the last time I felt comfortable in a bathing suit or not. Basically, I'm questioning my reality and if I'm seeing myself as I really am in the mirror. My friends, family, and boyfriend all think I'm way too hard on myself and tell me I'm beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a very normal weight, some may even say thin, but I just don't see myself that way. I do not suffer from any type of disordered eating. I try to eat as healthy as possible, but indulge fairly often and don't restrict myself much but lately I find myself feeling more guilt surrounding my indulgences and wondering if the women I see with the ideal bodies ever indulge like this, I think to myself that they must not and I should be more disciplined. I'm worried about going down a dark path when it comes to an unhealthy relationship with food, but I wouldn't say I'm quite there yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't work out nearly as much as I should and the fact of the matter is that if I did, I probably could easily achieve a body I'm more confident with, but I have the hardest time being motivated and just continue to hate on my body without doing anything about it. I definitely will start working out more just for health reasons and to manage my anxiety, but I'm sure if I got more toned, I'd still find things to be insecure about, so I want to get to the source and find out how to be confident with myself no matter what.

I am going to the beach with a bunch of friends on the 4th of July and I want to just be excited to spend time with friends and have fun but instead, I'm panicking about being in a bathing suit. The last time I went to the beach with this crew, I didn't even bring a bathing suit and everyone else was in their suits just enjoying themselves and I was envious of that and not even paying attention to their bodies. I'm sure they all have their own insecurities and no one had ""perfect"" bodies. I decided this time, I want to join everyone else and wear a bathing suit and face my fears.

I notice that for a long period I would get so depressed I would be indifferent about my health, like who cares, my life isn't worth anything anyhow. 

But the more I've challenged this feeling, the more anxiety I start to feel. Now that I am willing to consider a better future for myself, now I see every possible threat to it. I become more like a hypochondriac and I catastrophize about everything. Trying to control for things I suppose.

If I give into the fear too much I dip back into depressive feelings of futility. And the cycle starts again. The only way I feel I can break it is to keep going despite how anxious I am. I can check for concerns, but I shouldn't obsess over every little pain and possibility because I lose too much time.

I think i should quit school again but my step mom keeps sayin what else do you have to do. bc i quit my job and old school and went back home to live with my parents once i got out of the hospital after my suicide attempt. its been six months and i havent made any progress. so i guess my question is do i just keep my mouth shut and hope i keep my sanity or should i quit school get another job and move out so maybe i can get my mind right maybe try again for school or just let the masters go?

Her telling me to not be scared of social interaction is something that I have heard many times. ""Dont be shy"", ""be happy"", ""you dont have to get so mad"" are all phrases that I hear from other people when I am dealing with my MI. Its frustrating to hear this when you have to deal with social anxiety, depression, bipolar, and and anxiety. 

One time a customer had asked me for something and I just completely froze up. She was waiting for me to go get something and I just stood there. I dont know why.

 My coworkers will tell me how to properly hold dishes so that I can carry them around more efficiently but my brain dosent seem to grasp the concept.

160,0,"My anxiety has been kicking my ass lately. I take Prozac and Wellbutrin currently which was doing the trick for a while but like all medications I’ve taken they lose their effectiveness regardless of dose and I just really need a doctor to crack my brain code because I hate this.

I don’t want to live in fear, man. Like, I can read statistics all day about the two things I’m freaking out about the most (roller coasters, next week and flying, in a couple months) but I can’t get over the fact that there’s still the chance that I’ll be a part of the statistic. As far as roller coasters go, it’s not even necessarily the fear of getting hurt/dying, but of getting stuck due to malfunction. It would be literal torture for me to be barred down in a tiny seat on a tiny track without any way to get down by myself. That’s kind of the deal with flying, too. 

There’s a ton in my head right now. I can’t find a good psychiatrist in my area. I’m nursing so experimenting with new medication is mostly off-limits. I would totally be addicted to benzos if I had access to them so those are a no go. 

I feel stuck, yeah? Like, I know there’s always help, but more and more it feels like actually getting the help is just SUCH a process and almost an impossibility. I’m not bad off enough for something like inpatient (my depression is part of the party too) but every day is a struggle. 

Uhhh. Hey so I’m new. I hate my brain. Thanks for reading. It’s been almost two decades and I’m just soooooooo over it."
161,0,"My anxiety usually centers around phobias or obsessions. These phobias usually stick with me for years at a time. The most prominent and difficult phobia I’ve faced is a fear of going crazy, a fear of developing schizophrenia.

This fear/obsession fist emerged when I was 16. I am now almost 23. In my years dealing with this specific phobia I’ve made some great progress. I’ve seen some very helpful therapists and gotten on medication. Over-all, I’ve been doing much better than I was when I first developed the phobia.

One specific event, though, has made progress very difficult over the past year. My best friend of many years developed schizophrenia last summer. His personality changed considerably, to the point where it is now hard to recognize him and connect with him as I used to. He’s become unpredictable, aggressive, and delusional. It has been a really difficult year for me because I feel immense fear when I see what he is going through and I also feel a sense of loss and grief because the friend I knew doesn’t seem to be there anymore.

I know this is a disease that many suffer with. It is not my intention to stigmatize those who suffering with it or dehumanize anyone. I know that my friend, and all those who suffer with schizophrenia, have value and deserve love. My wish is only to express my feelings, which are complicated.

It is hard for me to feel love for or kinship with my friend. Being with him triggers my fears and causes me a lot of stress, grief and anxiety. Being with him is hard for me, so I have begun to distance myself from him. I felt fear before coming home from school for the summer because I knew I would be in close proximity to him. I feel a lot of guilt for having these feelings and for distancing myself from him. I also feel guilt for not being there for his family.

We were very close. I had never considered the possibility of us loosing touch or becoming distant. I assumed we would be friends for the rest of our lives. It is hard for me to reconcile those facts of our past friendship with my recent actions and feelings. It is hard for me to believe that I loved him as much as I did because I have not acted with love towards him recently.

So I am in conflict. I feel both the need to protect my mental wellbeing, and the need to be there for my friend. I feel grief for the loss of a friend, but also feel that that grief is unjustified because that friend is still living.

Right now I’m sitting in bed and my chest feels like a witch’s cauldron of emotions; churning, churning, churning. It’s hard for me to process all of these emotions. I hope, though, that I have effectively conveyed some of the things I am feeling. It has been a hard year.

If you’ve read this far I really do appreciate it. I’ve felt isolated recently and I needed to vent. I’ve dealt with this stuff long enough to know that good times will come again. I hope those good times come soon, for all of us. I'm dealing with a loss that is somewhat unique"

A few days ago I was in my office alone in silence at work and took a break from cleaning and tearing down boxes. I looked down at the box cutter in my hand and thought about it. Vertical. It would stop then. It was hard to remember “what about your son? He needs you. You can’t do this to him. What will he think? It’s going to mess him up forever if I do” I wasn’t overwhelmed with sadness. I was just tired. I put the box cutter away in a locked drawer and put the key where I can’t easily reach.

We had to break up a while ago. Her explanation was that she wasn’t ready for relationships since they can be demanding and serious at times. 

Since that day I’ve basically never been the same. My hopes for the future are that we can get back together once she sorts herself out. But every fucking day I’m plagued by thoughts such as:

_“What if she goes for someone else? I’ll be left alone. I can’t find people like this easily. Maybe she already likes someone else and doesn’t want to say it? I can’t be good enough no matter how hard I try. I’m pathetic. I wish I didn’t sorry this much. I want to die.”_ etc. 

This constant cycle of overthinking is eating me away. I think of her every single day, 2/3rds of a day. I’ve lost weight because I refused to eat during these days of anxiety attacks.

168,0,"My psych who got me started on clonazepam 8 years ago used to give me 2mg a day when I was like 99lbs. I stopped taking it for years because I wasn’t having anxiety. Now it has come back and I have realized more of what the issues are. He has started me on prozac and upped it this month to 40mg and added rexulti for 2 weeks. But wouldn’t refill the clonazepam for this month (he only gives me .5mg x60 a month now) bc it hadn’t been a month. Fair enough. I wait a little longer than a month, ask the pharmacy to fax him, and he denies it. He keeps telling me it’s not a daily thing (even tho he used to give it as such) but since I haven’t had any changes using the lower dose of Prozac, I think he should give it another month. I rely on that shit when I get antsy, anxious, and panicky bc I know it works. I can go a week without taking it, or I can take 2mg a day. Just depends. Just pissed me off he rejected it.

171,0,"So this is quite a big one for me. I have PTSD, Schizoaffective and GAD. 

I'm anxious about everything and nothing, but my biggest fear is that of death. Both my own death and the deaths of loved ones. 

It's not all of the time, it probably creeps up every month or so. Basically, it hits at night and it's this all consuming dread, anxiety and guilt. I end up crying every night. 

The guilt side of things stems from a suicide attempt last year. I took an OD and the doctors at the time told me I almost damaged my liver. I spent a few days in the hospital worrying about having to say my goodbyes (I had expected to fall asleep and never wake up, but now I was looking at a drawn out death).

Anyway, I'm physically fine now. But those memories creep up, the thoughts that I might die young, thinking of my parents dying young or my sister dying in a horrible car accident, etc. 

When these thoughts intrusively pop up, I cry. I cry because I'm scared of not existing, I'm scared of the hurt that would cause my family. I'm scared of being without my parents or my sister. 

By the way, I realise that taking an OD and having fears of death doesn't make a lot of sense, but I'll briefly explain that I took the OD because I was psychotic and thought killing myself would end terrorism. 

So yeah, I can't shake these thoughts and feelings and this overwhelming sense of dread. 

Please can anyone help me? Death anxiety. (TW: Suicide)"

For the last 2 years I lived in a flat with 4 other people and was surrounded by sound I got very angry and upset when my flatmate in the room next to me made any sound and she was some times inconsiderate but for the most part it was normal sounds. I have just moved into a single flat on my own to be able to study and have independence.

But I am getting so anxious in the new flat, in the living room you can hear someones TV only faint and I struggle to be in there if I don't have some of my music to cover it up and even if I do hearing it inbetween songs makes a knot in my stomach. 

I had my boyfriend over this weekend and it really helped I was starting to feel more like myself. But tonight I was not feeling amazing and had, had a long day at work and then went for a meal with some friends when I got back I just wanted to go to bed I talked to my boyfriend for a bit and then I was getting ready for bed and started to get to sleep then I heard some noise from another flat some music playing. 

My body just went into shock and I did not know what to do I needed to calm down it was not so loud or that late (10pm ish) that I felt I could go and say something and I knew that would just make me more anxious anyway. So I went to have a shower and then in the shower my stomach just clenched and I was sick over my bathroom and I just feel like shit and don't know what to do. 

I have messaged my boyfriend but I imagine he has gone to bed already and I think the noise has stopped but I have put on headphones with claming sounds and am trying not to think about it I intend on getting professional help but I wanted to hear if anyone has been though this before and has anyway of helping me thought it?

174,0,"I hung out with my two friends at the beach today and one of them said she was bringing along some other friends too. As soon as she mentioned it I felt the anxiety of talking to new people starting up. They made it very clear to bring bathing suits because we wanted to go swimming. Last minute before leaving my house, I took off my swimsuit thinking that I could talk to people less if I wasn’t going in the water with them. 

So we get there and everyone is taking off their clothes and I just say “I didn’t wear my swimsuit.” My friend turns to me and says “I like how you do your own thing. You didn’t wear a swimsuit because you didn’t want to even though everyone else wanted to swim.” I don’t know why but that made me really sad to think that instead of being this person with a constant fear of any social interaction, I could’ve been a strong independent girl. My friend just told me “I like how you do your own thing”. I’ve never told her that I’ve been diagnosed with social anxiety"

I said like I don't feel like i would ever self harm or do anything crazy and her exact words were ""OH OKAY YOU FEELING LIKE YOU WANT TO BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SELF HARM AND EVEN WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE BECAUSE ITS THE ANSWER FOR THEM"" I was really thinking why are you telling me that like I want to hear that. That actually nearly made me cry and I'm a strong person when it comes to emotions. She was more focused on asking me how my belly is then actually wanting to help about my anxiety. I even said to her I don't care about my belly right now I want my mind sorted out and she said good luck with that is a very job to do.

Like I just feel let down by the doctors i know they are under alot of stress and long shift patterns but aleast put passion and actually care for your patients.

Rant over!

Sorry if this off topic but I just think sometimes going to doctors can really mess with the mind. Hopefully if you need to go doctors try to see a doctor you already know. Rant about doctors."
177,0,"I havent had a general practitioner in a while and I’ve never seen a psychiatrist but I found a nurse practitioner (who’s my new general practitioner) and I saw her today for the first time and told her about my anxiety. *The reason I havent seen a psychiatrist is because I’m home for the summer and want to wait until im back at uni to find one. I told her I was weary about taking medication because honestly I dont think I can handle my anxiety getting worse but she assured me that this is the number one medication for anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I read over the full list of possible side effects and now Im really second guessing myself. I was hopeful when leaving the doctors office and telling my bf and closest friend that Im finally getting help but now I think I’ve scared myself out of it... I feel irrational and embarrassed about this, I really do want to help myself I was prescribed lexapro but I’m anxious about taking it because of the side effects"

179,0,"Why are people so concerned about me when they literally never reach out. I’m always the one staying up late with people to talk about their problems. Don’t get me wrong, I love giving advice and helping my friends out. But it’s never reciprocated. Someone who I thought was my best friend told me a few months ago that she wouldn’t hurt my feelings if I stopped asking her for advice and stopped acting like she was a therapist. I confided in her because she was the only person I could talk to. I didn’t want advice. I wanted comfort. So when I post that I feel like I want to die, stop acting like you’re surprised and like you care. I don’t get it"
180,0,"Anxious feelings have repeatedly held me back in life, and are preventing me from who I want to be. Life isn't worth living like this, but I don't wish to die, either. 

I have an escapist attitude to conflict, I become paralyzed when about to criticize something/someone. If someone threatens to hurt me, I usually get very, very anxious. I feel stressed out at the thought of people not liking me/my interests, or hating on me. And I can't even play a prank on someone without getting stressed for fucks sake..

I'm sick and tired of being a coward. I know who I would like to actually be, I have a fairly clear image of it. I know it's possible to change,

181,0,"So I’ve had an official anxiety diagnosis for almost 4 years now, but I’ve always shown clear signs of it, even when I was a small child. I also have ADHD, and I’m not sure if this thing I’m experiencing could be from anxiety, ADHD, or something entirely different. I was hoping some of you guys could help me out by letting me know if any of you have also experienced this. 

What I am experiencing is sorta like a panic attack in the sense that I can’t control when they happen, and they can brought on directly by stressful situations, like exams or ordering food in a restaurant. They can also be totally random, though. 

But instead of going into, well, panic, I just sorta freeze. My mind goes totally blank, and I mean TOTALLY blank. As in I don’t even have thoughts (or I can’t identify them, I suppose). I feel like I’m floating, and like I’m in a dream. Moving becomes incredibly difficult and although it is possible, the slightest movement requires a stupid amount of energy and willpower. Sometimes I can go without moving for hours. And I don’t blink regularly either and my eyes start watering like crazy from being open for too long... I can here and see people talking to me, but I can’t process their questions and I just end up staring blankly at them, and they freak out cause they think I’m having a stroke or something. It’s humiliating.

“Waking up” from one of those episodes is like waking up from a nap - I don’t remember laying/sitting there for hours, and I never know how long it’s been until I look at a clock. And once I’m out of the trance, I feel like I NEED to sleep. It feels like I just pulled an all-nighter and now my body’s low-fuel alarm is going off and all I can think about is “Sleep! I need to sleep or I’m going to collapse!! I. Need. Sleep. NOW!!”.

I’ve asked all my psychologists/therapists that I’ve had over the years, and the best I’ve gotten is that this is the “freeze” part of the fight/flight/freeze response, which makes sense, but I feel so alone because every time I talk to someone (not a professional) about it, they don’t know what I’m talking about. And does this trance thing have a name?? Other than The-Freeze-Portion-Of-The-Fight-Flight-Or-Freeze-Response?

Please help. I’m desperate. This is ruining my life!! I can’t even count the amount of times I’ve failed exams because I just froze and didn’t move for the entire time. And my god, I’m not even gonna get into all the extra anxiety and stress (and more freezy times!) that confronting my teachers creates when they ask me why the heck I handed in a blank sheet of paper. Does anyone else experience this? I have no idea if this is my anxiety, or if there’s some other disorder going on as well..."
182,0,"Long story short, I (male, mid-20s, suffered from depression and anxiety since childhood) had the worst panic attack I've ever had about a week ago. I to the ER after spending hours convinced that I suffered from a stroke or aneurysm, even though I suffered from no physical symptoms. After a clean bill of health, I'm discharged with a suggestion to take better care of myself. However, as I'm leaving, I notice that I'm feeling a bit off. I shrugged it off and assumed it was recourse from the attack or the IV/blood loss from the bloodwork, but I still feel the same a week later.

Essentially, I'm much more apathetic and a little bit numb, but also much more focused and aware than I had been before. I also noticed that my balance, dexterity, and tension headaches have decreased. I have full strength and no signs of a stroke, but I do have a loss of appetite and occasional lapses in focus. It's a little alarming and I don't know anyone personally who has experience with something like this...

Could anyone give any suggestions or insight on what's going on? I'm a little concerned and would really like a bit of reassurance. Can your personality and emotions change after a panic attack?"

184,0,"So I'm a beach lifeguard in the UK and I have to take a fitness test every month in order to be able to work, except I get the most awful anxiety beforehand - nausea, chest pains, heart palpitations - the lot.
My fitness test involves running 200m in 40s, 400m swim in 7 minutes 30s and a 25m underwater swim followed by a 25m sprint swim in under 50 seconds.
The swim stuff I'm really okay with, I get well within the timing, but the run really makes me nervous,  I've gotten 40s on the dot for the time on a previous run, and I don't know whether it's this that's making me nervous, or the fact that they can fire me if I fail the test more than 3 times.

186,0,"Hello. I just noticed that my mind was literally melting and creating weird anxiety obsessive thoughts when I look anything even for minutes at my 15"" laptop monitor, the text size is too small, and I have nearsightedness maybe related with that. It's like I don't want to exaggarate but it was keeping me in that burn out state and depersonalization bcuz I couldn't detect what is going on before. Used it like that for a year and I was unable to read stuff without being in pain and anxiety. But I thought anxiety was from something else. Now I did put another monitor and it is big and modern one and it's like anxiety just vanished away, I do spend a lot of time on computer and read too much. I don't think it is placebo because I tested it for a week. Any ideas? Can fucking eye vision and light or screen cause anxiety that much? Can small text size and bad quality small laptop screen cause peaking in anxiety?"

I also started drinking and smoking weed alot more regually.

189,0,"I have been lonely since after middleschool when we moved to a new town. I had great friends in middleschool and was very social. When we moved to a new town in my freshman year, everything went down hill. In my freshman year i got a terrible nickname and couldn't make any friends because of it and i started spending weekends alone and im in senior year now and nothing has gotten better. My nickname has disappeared though because everyone has forgotten about me and i became the quiet kid in school. My social skills has gone down and i cant even make friends outside my school or keep my old friends and now my mom is constantly telling me how disappointed she is because i cant find a date for prom and she also keeps telling me to get friends to hang out with during holidays as all i have to do with myself during these times is to play video games. 

Over time i have stopped caring and just accepting  that i am lonely and trying to have inner peace with myself but recently my loneliness has hit me harder than ever before. 

You know when you sit and imagine yourself in situations that you'll probably never be in and act it all out in your head.. We all do it. Now i have recently imagined myself with a beautiful girl i love a lot and how my family and everyone sees me being happy with her(yes i know it sounds cringy). She looked like queen margaery from GoT as i fell in love with her while re watching the show and couldn't stop thinking of her(ik its wierd). So while i sat playing games and imaging myself with such a girl i snapped back to reality and realized how little i actually have and how i may probably miss out on this experience of loving someone so much you'll do anything for them and spending time with that person and going places with her and laughing about stupid things.

I am scared that i will never experience this beautiful side of life and never meet someone like this. I also dont experience any love from my family. I might sound ungrateful as i have a mother and father that are still married and i feel extremely guilty for being so ungrateful but i just feel that we never actually speak to one another and i have absolutely no relationship with my dad and i just keep disappointing him and my mother because of my loneliness and tourettes symdrome that they get annoyed at. 

All i want in my life is a loving family. A group of people that i can come home to and forget about everything else. I am anxious that i will just die alone without experiencing this.

190,0,"I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. It’s summer so I’m (20F) just working and not going to class. But I’m still burnt out every single day. I’ve been having a horrible week so far and have been extremely anxious at work, which leads me to be depressed when I get home. I text my therapist sometimes when I’m feeling particularly distressed and did so today, telling her about the suicidal ideation I’ve been having. My job is easy but I hate it and it stresses me out so much because of my social anxiety. I take three meds but they still don’t seem to be right for me. My parents pay for my meds and my therapy sessions and psychiatrist appointments and they always talk about how expensive everything is. It makes me feel like a big ass burden and makes me wanna kill myself. 

My therapist urged me to check myself into the hospital but I’m weary of going since that’s gonna cost my parents more money and make them even more mad. I honestly do wanna go just so everyone can leave me alone, but I feel like it wouldn’t make anything better, just a more strained relationship with my parents and shit from my supervisors at work. But I really do wanna die. I want someone to rescue me from this shit and take me away. All I do is cry all day, even at work. Should I honestly go to the hospital?

196,0,"i came to this conclusion after putting in the effort of understanding more about my anxiety.

when my parents took us out to eat and it was time to order i'd be bombarded with ""tips"" from my dad about how to order food which would usually be along the lines of ""stand straighter. talk louder. make eye contact."", in a hushed voice followed by my confidence and self esteem deflating.

however, when i was with a friend and my parents weren't around i was never ""on edge"" about how to order and i actually had more confidence and high self esteem!

my mom on the other hand is very critical and judgmental about everything, hence why i don't like bringing friends over because as soon as they leave it's ""she doesn't talk a lot. her shoes are dirty. her hair looks greasy."", etc.

long story short, i feel my parents are (mainly) the root of my anxiety because being around them makes me uncomfortable due to the fact that i feel as if they are always watching my every move and it puts pressure on me and makes me feel nervous to mess up. feeling as if parents are the root of my anxiety?"

As someone who is coming to terms with being abused ( emotionally, verbally, physically, and s*xually) that has heightened my anxiety. About May I started displaying symptoms that I have NEVER had. My legs would feel like jelly, like the floor was moving, as if I were about to faint and I would get dizzy. This hasn’t stopped since May and now we’re in July and I’m going crazy. I had a EEG and the results should come in soon but of course my anxiety is kicking my ass. I know that it will most likely 99.9% be anxiety. But that doesn’t stopped me from googling my symptoms on WEDmd and thinking I have some tumor or rare disease from a third world country.

201,0,"I'm new to this sub so apologies for any errors or misunderstanding of any rules.

I came here because I am hoping this will help me put my mind at ease as I am too weak to actually talk to anyone about it. I am not diagnosed with anxiety and am not trying to self-diagnose or anything but this just felt like the most fitting sub for this. 

For maybe a year and a half now I haven't been able to shake the feeling that all my friends hate me and anyone who I respect is disappointed in me (with the exception of family fortunately). I first noticed it when playing games with my oldest friend. We would play online practically every Saturday as we live pretty far away now but whenever he didn't want to play or would respond I would start stressing out and lose interest in doing anything else. this persisted for a while. The next time I noticed it got worse was with my theater tech group and robotics team. I have always worked pretty close with the theater tech director but I absolutely hate talking to him despite him being extremely nice. I can't help but feel like he's disappointed in my recent work and thinks I don't show up enough. When ever I would see him walking around campus I would always do my best to act like i didn't notice him for fear of confrontation. I think this is in part because i was trying to balance tech with robotics which i had similar but different feelings. I was supposed to be leadership but showed up less than half the time due to tech (this has all been past-tense because I have recently graduated). This is about when it started to be a constant worry.

Things started to get really bad once the second semester started. Due to a collision of friend groups I made a couple of new friends that I like to think have become some of my closest friends. up until I met them I have never spent time with any of my friends outside of school or school extracurriculars. with this new, larger friend group we would go get coffee after school and hang out for a bit. Having never done this before I was always eager to hang out all the while convinced that they hated me. Now the 'the boys' included more said 'boys' I have been worried that I do not spend enough time with each individual while somehow also thinking I am too eager to hang out and come across as needy (if I am being honest I absolutely fucking am but I do my best to roll it back, fortunately this is made easier by the fact that I'm a pushover and when people don't want to hang out I don't them about it). I have this constant feeling that they hate me and its always there, I can do things to distract myself but not entirely. I still feel it like a giant leeches are sucked on my back, its an absolute physical sensation and it makes me want to melt into the floor and destroys any interest in doing anything at all. 

This feeling has gotten so incredibly, much worse in the past couple of days. Now that we've all graduated we don't see each other every day but I don't think that bugs me very much. A couple of my friends are working at our (now old) high school by helping run a robotics program for middle school kids and some of us would show up just to hang out when their shift is up. Three days ago, on a Friday, my friend 'M' called us while we were there and rather eagerly wanted to plan sometimes to hang out before he leaves for Korea. we planned to do something this coming Sunday and something with just me, his sister, and some of his friends( that I don't know and aren't part of the main friend group) later this week because he wanted to show me this cool board game shop and play some games there. I agree and am excited to hang out with him again because we've both been traveling with family. The next day I text in the group chat trying to plan what we wanted to do on Sunday but replies are scattered and nothing concrete is made. I throw out the idea of playing D&amp;D and people are interested but some people cant make it. I was looking for 3 players because I hate DMing for just 2. Only two,'T' and 'W' could make it but we were still waiting on confirmation from M. Only replies from M were a couple of Thanos gifs leaving us with no solid plans. Sunday morning, Dawn of the Final Day, I try to plan something but still nothing from M other than maybe another Thanos gif. I start to get worried if M is okay and message him asking so and also absolutely convinced he hates me. T, W and I end up hanging out, getting coffee and going to a record store, the whole time I am so uncomfortable and stressed out. during this T reveals that M had messaged him privately but doesn't feel right sharing which I absolutely respect and I didn't push at all. I am now certain that either something is wrong and/or he hates me. I spent the rest of Sunday and all of Monday trying and failing to convince myself that he doesn't hate me and I haven't been able to do anything else. I try running some errands for my Mom but that did distract me at all. I messaged T asking if M is okay being clear I don't want to push  saying ""don't share if you feel it's not your place to but I'm starting to get concerned about M. Do you know if he's alright?"" and he replied with ""yeah he's fine."" which did ease my mind a bit, at least I know that he's not in any trouble but I am still convinced he hates me. I messaged M a couple of times today asking about other plans we made on Friday but still no reply.

I was supposed to play games with other friends but couldn't find the heat to, I tried to sleep but I'm still writing this at 1am, M still hasn't replied. I've been stalking his steam profile, he's invisible but his recent activity is going up so I know he's playing games. I feel disgusting, I want to disappear. I'm sitting here crying and desperately wanting to scream. I know these thoughts are irrational but that makes me hate myself more. I want to scream. 

sorry for the tower of text. I suspect Ill be refreshing this page the rest of the night. Thanks for reading.

Tl;dr: I made plans to make plans with a friend and he went completely dark and I think he hates me now.

202,0," I honestly don't know if I truly have panic attacks. My parents explained some people pass out from them, and some go to hospitals ECT...so whenever I tell them I think I'm having a panic attack, they shut me down and explain how wrong I am.

205,0,"Last summer was the worst months of anxiety. Last summer, I couldn’t stop anxiety and I kept checking and rechecking with my boyfriend. It was our 1st year anniversary and I was basically grilling him with questions for hours and he kinda just...snapped. Not angry, but his normally very patient self got very somber and just went: “I just wanted to have a nice anniversary”

Fast forward a year later, my anxiety is 10x better than what it was. I rarely get panic attacks, and when I do, they’re short.

Yesterday was our 2nd anniversary. BF want to have the day together to just chill. It’s an awesome, chill day, but we have to go to a rehearsal (I’m in a play, he’s doing lights). This irks him a bit because he really just wanted an “us” day (I did too), but the ppl there are fun so his annoyance doesn’t last long. We decide that after, we will go home to cuddle some more to finish off the day on an intimate note. 

Anyway, my friend (who is also in the play) tells me her husband is away and is afraid of being by herself in the house. That gives HER anxiety (she also has BAD anxiety). She also can’t drive (due to anxiety as well). She asks me between scenes if she can sleep over at my house. I say sure because I know what panic feels like, and honestly, we are about to go on stage and I’m not even really thinking.

(A note: my bf and I live separately still; still living with parents to save money).

Fast forward to the end of rehearsal. I quickly tell my bf what’s going on (I honestly forgot I didn’t tell him; again it happened so quick). And I drop him off then take my friend to her place so she can get her stuff. We realize we can’t sleep over tonight (family stuff, long story) and so I drive back home. It’s too late at this point to go to his house (I’m exhausted) and again, I can’t sleep over with him tonight.

When I call my bf, he sounds not too happy. Just kinda short. I ask him what’s wrong, and he says he was looking forward to ending the day with just us, that it would have been different if I had talked to him about the change of plans first, but that it’s our anniversary and he feels abandoned. I at first get defensive, but then listen when he says he feels like his frustrations are sometimes fought against. 

So that right there started getting me anxious, “I’m a bad partner, oh no oh no oh no”

So I listen to his frustrations, then I kinda just say, “I feel like there’s a trend of bad anniversaries, last year was bad and this year was too”

And he says “yeah last year was really bad. And this year...yeah it ended on a bad note”

My stomach dropped. 

He is usually VERY understanding. Very sweet, always there when I am anxious. Always very patient, kind, supportive.

But apparently I just can’t stop fudging up anniversaries. I stayed up for three hours fighting against the urge to run or scream or break something or hurt myself (very characteristic of my panic). 

I literally felt like my world was ending, just repeating in my head what a mess up I am. 

I still feel anxious today. It was a struggle going to sleep :(

Idk what to do. I can’t go back and change it.

I did all those things last year and it made me look half decent but I was still too scared to go outside alone.

My 2 best friends moved away when I was 13 and since then I'm very shut in and my life is just sporadically getting worse.

This is the first time in my life in which I don't have any friends at all. I don't respond to any childhood friends. I burned bridges with every person I know, I don't interact with my family at all. My parents gave up on me as well, they aren't part of my life even though I live at home. I wish they would die.

I don't even feel lonely anymore, it's just my default state of being.

I dropped out of high school this year, I just felt too alienated in every shape of form. My classmates were all very kind to me and invited me to hangouts/parties and stuff but I just can't let anyone close to me, I feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me.

I stopped going to my therapist after the 3rd session we had, I think I didn't like him, don't have any other therapists to compare him to, though.

I lost everybody, everything that was important to me once and feel like a phantom, I feel like I'm already dead and won't live to 18.

The only passions I have are Music and Filmmaking.

208,0,"Was prescribed escitalopram today for my anxiety. Was directed to break a 10mg pill in half and start with that...I think ? Now I can't remember what she said. If I am to take a half twice a day or just once. Until I see how it effects me. 

I've heard mixed reviews. I'm worried about weight gain. Does the drug itself cause it or does it cause an increase in appetite which leads to overeating so I'll just need to watch that ?

My migraine condition was giving me daily headaches here, my stomach was... I don't know, destroying itself with acid and ulcers, and I was using all of my personal time to go cry because clients would just yell at me(just the kind of business it was). Then the ""efficiency"" changes started. And I snapped. I was hanging on despite my psychologist telling me I should quit, because I need the money and my family was so hard set against me giving up a well paying job with benefits and pension. But I was destroying myself for my family, for money. Money isn't everything if I want to kill myself. I finally agreed to take a slightly lower paying job with no benefits, and the offer just came in this weekend. The next 2 weeks should go by much easier. If I can only deal with the anxiety of handling my family, who I have to live with since a breakup a year ago and I am still saving for a new place. I got a new job!"

I had just said how anxious I was feeling when my closest friend said, ""I'm sure you're just exaggerating again. Everyone feels nervous before a speech.""
I then said that most people don't have panic attacks everyday a week before the event and would rather throw myself in front of a car than take part but they wouldn't listen.
I haven't been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but I feel I've at least got the early stages of social anxiety as I get a lot of panic attacks around social situations so I understand where their coming from but it still hurts that they don't make an attempt to understand.

216,0,"Driving gives me the worst anxiety. I'm not sure why as I've never been in any real accidents or anything but I'm always worried I will be or that a loved one will be. I think it's not having full control that scares me. 

When I turned 15 1/2 I got my learners permit. I renewed it once the time was up and then ended up having to go in again and get another one. Still didn't end up getting my license. I just never got to practice enough. 

That was between the ages of 15-18. Now I'm 24, going to be 25 in a couple months and I still don't have my license. This is keeping me from getting a real job and starting my life. I appreciate my parents a lot but I really want to start making a living so I can move out and be on my own. For some reason, I'm not scared of the thought of that at all. It's just driving. And unfortunately, where I live, I have to have a car. There's no place for me to work within walking distance. Not even a bus station. I need a car. I need to learn to drive. But even just thinking about it makes me break down in tears. 

For some reason I'm more scared to do it now than I was when I was younger. I really wish I would have just gone to driving school and gotten it then. My parents would have paid for it, but because they were moaning about how expensive it was I told them I'd just allow them to teach me which didn't really work out as well as I thought. Need to get my driving permit...but I'm absolutely terrified and break down every time I think about it."

The voice of anxiety always tells me that I'm a total fuckup and always make stupid decisions, and let me tell you, this voice is being quite validated right now.

But now at night, I sometimes get breakdowns I don't want anyone else to see.
I always feel so alone and cold. So small.
During the nights it gets even worse.
So during one of my ""midnight-crisis"" moments, I found myself thinking
""I want to go home..""
Again, nothing out of the ordinary. As a kid I always stayed at home if I weren't at kindergarten or later school. It felt safe and warm.

221,0,"I know that this has probably (definitely) been asked before, but everyone experiences panic attacks differently and I wanted to contrast the one I experienced last year (which actually sent me to the ER) with other cases. The reason I'm even asking is because I need to know if what I experienced was an ACTUAL panic attack or some other medical issue; the nurse who checked me out at the hospital said my blood pressure and everything was ""fine"" and that I just had a mild panic attack: I was completely out of breath, my arms felt numb and for some reason started retracting inward, along with my fingers. I literally thought I was about to die. The EMTs probably made it worse because I was hesitant about going to the ER and that stressed me out more because who wants to pay an ER visit bill for something ""minor"" but I wound up going anyway...

If anyone could just go into detail about how their body reacted upon experiencing an attack in the past or recently, that'd be great... Can someone provide an explicit/detailed of a panic attack experience?"

My heart has been beating like crazy, everything is blurry. i am just shaking. before i got the face to face interview I had a online written interview that i had to submit to the company and i did fine (i am okay writing but talking........no). i graduated last year and this is my very first interview after a long time.......well in 6 months i only applied like 10-15 jobs cause I was afraid of interview.

I have prepared for it, I looked at their website and wrote key stuffs, i read about the job, even practice to answer interview question (I type everything onto my computer). But when i looked away to answer it, i CANT! MY HEAD IS EMPTY, I CANT THINK. earlier i had phone appointment with my university career advisor. she asked me 2 mock question, it was bad. the first took me a while to answer, it wasnt even a good one. the second question was terrible , i couldnt answer anything. i am so scared. i know this sounds crazy and stupid but i cry everytime i think about the interview.

i am fine talking with ppl like normal conversation but put me on a q&amp;a, you lost me.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to cancel this interview.... i feel i need more time. they gave me week notice and i prepared the whole week. i did spend two days on the company site and theri anual reports. my fault. but i feel i need more time. i know that cancelling this appointment may not be able to give a chance to work for that company again..... but idk.....i feel really sick. i dont know what to say to my close friends and my parents (they know about it, myb I shouldnt have told everyone).

im sorry im blabbering......idk what to do. like i tell my self on the day is gonna be fine, but for real i try to practice and i cant answer nothing eventhought i answered fine writing it. i feel really unready.......

224,0,"I have been having one of the worst weeks I've had in years.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started with quitting my first job. I used to work in a warehouse and it was fine, just boring. I'd gone almost two years without a write-up and nothing but praise as far as my work ethic and productivity. I was told I was one of the best on the team. This was probably the healthiest I'd ever felt mentally. I felt stable.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I transferred I was written up a couple of weeks in because I had made something like 2 errors in 1,000 items. I knew I had another write upcoming due to the insane productivity standards. I realized I was only one write up away from being fired. I already deal with anxiety and depression regularly and the thought of losing my job put it all into overdrive. It had me in tears and shaking every night before work for weeks. I  made myself sick just thinking of stepping foot back in that place. I spent all of my free time sleeping or feeling like human garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided enough was enough and I wasn't going to let them do this to me anymore.  I quit as soon as I had another job lined up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I came into the new retail job very enthusiastic and happy to be out of the warehouse. Though it quickly became apparent that it wasn't going to be the positive change I was hoping for. All the horrible feelings came back worse than ever because this new job somehow managed to be worse than the first.  I work hard, I come home bruised, cut, sore, and drenched in sweat from practically running from one side of the store to another to get things done. My hands have been painfully locking up on me and my arm hasn't been the same since my last job.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've received almost no training for this job and can't seem to get any help no matter how many times I ask. Everyone seems to avoid me. The people I can get to talk to me say that I'm doing fine and it just takes time. The manager made it clear he feels otherwise and I'm sure I'm on the fast track to being fired. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I've only had the job for 8 days and I've been talked to twice about my productivity. The expectations I'm given just seem so impossible to me right now but I still hate myself for not being able to reach them.  I can't talk to anyone about just how much pain this puts me in to not be able to do this job at 110%. The few people I can vent to tell me I need to just toughen up and that's just how life is.  I keep being told this is one of the easiest jobs out there and tell me there is no way I could be failing at it. I've also been told I would have to be completely inept to not be getting it. They won't genuinely listen to my concerns and always turn it into my fault and me being weak.  I'm starting to feel just so worthless about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sick to my stomach and I have never wanted to disappear more in my life. Just the anxiety of going in this coming week is eating me alive. The manager already told me he has a huge project he wants to put me on to test me, I've only done the task once with help on a very abnormal day. I've barely been trained for it and I feel like I'm being set up to fail. I know when that day comes he's going to be disappointed and more than likely angry that I can't get it done in time. I'm constantly being told to hurry up.  I'm doing everything I can to improve, I've read lots of advice, I've tried getting the manager's help, I just don't know what else to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

 The closer it gets to the end of my weekend the more I try to come up with something drastic to do just to get out of going back. I've been spending all my spare time either panicking about this job or sleeping to avoid thinking about it. The anxiety gets at me so bad there are days I can't even bring myself to eat or do much of anything. The manager tells me he understands I'm slow because I'm new but immediately starts hounding me about going faster after he says that. I feel humiliated and ashamed by all of this. I've been applying like mad to anything and everything for a chance to escape the hell that's coming this week but setting up interviews just takes so much time.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep telling myself its just a minimum wage job and there are plenty of others. If I get fired I may be able to get unemployment as well.  I have an online side hustle too, and I can use that to pay my bills if I have to. I keep trying to remind myself that I can only do my best and if that's not enough then there isn't much else I can do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

The only positive thing keeping me going right now is that I am on the third interview for an amazing company and it at least seems to be going well. I will be making double my current hourly rate if I can land it. and If all goes well I will have a way to escape this awful job. Though I can't help but feel it's pointless to get my hopes up and that I'm being delusional. There are lots of other candidates. I'm worried I'm coming off as desperate to the hiring manager because of my underlying situation. This really would be a dream job for me as it's in the field I got my degree in.. I'm trying to think positive.

&amp;#x200B;

 I know this was long but I have no friends to talk to because of all the moving I've done my whole life.  I have no other outlet for my stress and the only people close to me are very cynical and don't seem to understand. It kind of helps just to get it off my chest and into words. I know I over think things and blow things out of proportion at times but it doesn't stop me from feeling like my world is ending. Severe anxiety from work"
225,0,"idk if this is the normal stuff to post but I need to vent 🤷🏾‍♂️.So I’ve not left my house for a while because the idea of people around me and all the noise and lights is enough to freak me out for days but today I went outside. My little brother, who’s 7, has been getting bullied by these girls who are aged 7-9. Now, I love my brother, so I went outside with him to help him. This bullying has went on for a while and he’s seriously being affected by it, it’s gotten to the point of him being afraid to go out in case he sees them. So i go to the parents house of these girls to tell them about it (my parents suggested I went). When they opened to the door they started shouting at how they didn’t want “people like me” at the door ( I’m black). At this point I couldn’t breathe and was freaking out. I was on the verge of tears but I saw my brothers face and I couldn’t just leave him to be bullied. So I said that their daughters had been bullying my brother but they shouted back saying their “angels” would never do such things. These kids have told my brother to die, they’ve called him stupid and autistic (which he isn’t), and have said he’d never be loved or have friends. I was about to pass out at this point and had to lean on the wall to keep myself up. I told them that my brother shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of stuff (I more mumbled it tbh) and they said he should man up. Like bro wtf. At this point I genuinely felt I was gonna pass out and had to quickly retreat to my house, run upstairs, turn the shower on then sit on the floor and breakdown. All I wanted to do was help my brother and I can’t even do that without crying. Any advice on how to be braver or how to actually be a good big brother?

228,0,"I've had aquaphobia (fear of water - specifically my head being underwater) for many many years. My boyfriend is planning a magnificent canoe trip for us and some friends to go on and I'm TERRIFIED.

I've been successful overcoming some of my phobia so far - I can go swimming if I start slow at the shallow end/beach, I went sailing (was petrified the whole time but I did it), and I've participated in a few dragon boat events. 

He suggested we join a canoe club so we can take the canoe out and practice with it. I joined, but here's the catch: we need to pass a short course to be able to borrow the canoes. This involves getting into the boat, tipping it, and recovering from tipping it within the allotted time frame with the instructor. Just thinking about this class and the trip is giving me anxiety.

I've been having a hard time controlling my GAD the last while so this is really starting to push me over the edge. I go out for a jog and pray I get hit by a car or break my limbs so I don't have to do any of this. I'm worried about what the instructor will say to me and I'm even more worried that I'll ruin this trip for everyone. To top it off, I legitimately feel guilty about my feelings on this. Anyone I try to talk to about this doesn't understand either, they just make it worse. They say ""oh, it's no big deal it's just a little water"" or ""the worst that'll happen is you'll get wet"". This makes things so much worse. This whole ordeal is completely consuming my thoughts.

230,0,"hi I’m writing this because I am very, very insecure about my penis size. I know that I’m not necessarily ‘small’  (6.8x4.9) but I’m very insecure. Basically I came out of a long term relationship, became very depressed and became addicted to porn. Seeing all those camera distorted penis’s made me very very insecure about my own size. I feel like I’m too thin! Even knowing that my girth is average, and therefore 50% of guys will be thinner and 50% thicker, I feel like I’ve got a thin dick. I think the issue stems from my length, I’m quite long and I think that just adds to the illusion. If I was 5.5-6 inches long it would look thicker? I just feel really insecure and I don’t know how to stop feeling this way. I’ve been complimented on my size, given girls multiple o’s through piv but I still feel very very anxious whenever I think about my penis and having sex.

231,0,"Had a breakdown over my 3 year relationship. I don't know what I'm anxious about or how I'm even feeling. Just thought my thoughts out would beat crying myself to sleep.

I feel like i don't love him anymore. But i love him so much? So the fact that i don't love him makes me feel miserable, he's so nice. But sometimes i feel like he's less than nice, and i don't like the way he treats me. But am i asking for too much?

 Am i being unreasonable? I feel like I'm making boulders out of pebbles. I overthink everything, is my anxiety ruining us? Am i projecting my own problems onto him, because deep down i know he's just a good person. He has his flaws but that's normal. Why am i sad then? We go out and i feel almost bored or exasperated with how he acts? And i feel bad about feeling that way just because it feels presumptuous to want anything from him when I'm kind of a shitty person. 

I shouldn't make decisions when I'm emotional. Really when i read over this, am i questioning wether i really love him? Am i being selfish? Should i let him go if i feel this way, I'm wasting his time. But i don't want to, is it because i love him. I do like him, I'll always like him. 

I feel like he doesn't love me, even though he says he does. Again i think that's my problem. I don't like how i get jealous every time he messages or meets up with girls, even if they're in relationships. I hate how i need to feel constantly needed or wanted. I hate how i can't stop looking for problems. It's so wrong and i know it's because of an issue with me. I'm so worried that I'm selfishly hurting him by not breaking it off. 

We fight infrequently and the times between that are so good. But it seems i inevitably get upset and he never gets mad at me, i don't understand. It makes me so so grateful he's willing to put up with my mountain of depression and anxiety but also makes me feel horrible for not being able to be like that for him. a sad stream of conciousness I'm throwing into the void"

Every time one goes off I’m certain it’s actually a gunshot, or there’s going to be a shooting and no one will notice because the sound of fireworks will mask the sound of the gun.

233,0,"So recently I've been under a looot of stress. 

When I'm stressed I also tend to get panicky and obsessive about my health.

I started getting some neck pain, and for a while I was convinced I had a swollen lymph node in my neck (the area felt kind of swollen, but mostly tight), and thus had cancer (obviously). I went to a doctor and he threw me a prescription for antibiotics to ""try"" without ever testing me or even asking me questions. I was like nooo thanks. Since then I've talked to several doctors who all have something different to say and have been completely unhelpful. But it's been obvious to all but the first doctor that I don't have an infection and antibiotics are not warranted (this doesn't stop me from being worried 24/7 that I might anyway).

Since then I've researched ENDLESSLY on what could be happening and I'm at the point now where I am convinced I actually have a muscle knot since I also have random pain in other parts of my upper back, and the knot seems like a trigger point. I looked up a diagram and it showed the location of where pain often occurs along with the trigger point and its exactly where mine is located. That coupled with the fact there aren't any lymph nodes where mine was, plus I could only feel the knot where the muscle is under my skin whereas lymph nodes swell and are visible above the skin. 

Obviously I'm not a doctor, so I cant be sure if this is the problem or not, but I've tried getting professional help and it's gotten me nowhere, so.

I'm curious to know if others with anxiety have experienced pain/tightness in their neck and shoulders, and how they deal with it. It's going on two weeks now and the pain comes and goes. It's better when I'm not at work, or when I'm out walking around. I've been depressed lately, so I haven't been getting out of the house much - I've noticed the pain can get worse if I'm sedentary. Also when I do sleep it's like I'm dead and I literally wont move all night, so sometimes I wake up with one hell of a kink in my neck, which hasn't been helping. It's concerning because I have been having issues breathing properly due to panic and I've noticed my arms feel heavy sometimes, and recently the veins on my chest and neck have become more noticeable - they always were visible on my chest, so it's not too weird.

237,0, Meditation and mindfulness practices have been shown to lower depression and reduce anxiety. Several studies show increased alpha waves in people who meditate. Neuroscientists believe this not only reduces depressive symptoms – it increases creative thinking as well. SOS meditations are engineered to readily access calm and the body’s self-healing potential. By using elements that our mind finds familiar– music and words - it helps us relax and let go of random thoughts. Does meditation help with anxiety?

My main question is--I heard that people use sunglasses to help with the overload feelings during the summer and I feel that this would be beneficial to me. The problem is this would make my anxiety higher as I'd feel self conscious. It's kind of a giant loop. Does anyone else feel this way? Wearing new items of clothing--DAE get anxiety in public?"
242,0," 

hello, i'm throwing a SOS here as doctors in my country were not able to help me... has seen a bunch from several specialties (endocrinologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, immunologist etc) for 3/4 years without any amelioration, result or proper diagnostic.

i will try to make it as short as possible, let me know if other details are needed. 25 female, caucasian, europe, 1m60, 52 kg, currently no medication other than topical steroids for my eczema.sorry for the english.

I basically would like to know if what i am experiencing is ""normal"" and it's indeed something 'psychological', that i'm not the only case in this world.

Basically i've been through a quite rough period of my life a few years ago (a bit bullied, not comfortable at school etc), nothing that serious but i am a quite sensitive person. I developed some anxiety after it.

1. 3 years of my life, i stuggled to live and done everything with lots of effort. I basically forced myself and my body to keep up and be able to study etc. during those years my eczema was really awful (not sure if it was indeed atopic eczema or something else, but there was hives/itching and chronic flares up and scars).
2. 2 years of my life were in bed. going to the doctors to see if there's something wrong, blood tests positive, mri fine, sleep test fine. living with parents, being financially supported by them.

my main symptoms: you know the feeling you have when you have temperature (40 celsius degrees)? the feeling in the head? i had that (head feeling unwell). sometimes like someone had hit me on the head on different places. sometimes like there's something ""empty"" in my head or missing.feeling like someone had put a metal bar in my head. not migraines. feeling like i do not get enough oxygen. can describe more although it's difficult.

body weakness (not muscles weakness), as in no energy, feeling like i hadn't have sleep for ages (also i was sleeping more than i should), sleepy frequently, having long naps during the day.

superior members (arms etc) mainly feeling weak compared to the legs.

overall feeling very very unwell to the extent to not being able to do normal stuff (shower, etc). symptoms very physical NOT psychological (wasn't feeling sad or having dark thoughts). the head was the most awful thing. not migraines, not headaches. a bit hard to describe.

appetite quite normal.

have done stuff like traveling etc (accompanied with parents), nothing changed during the trip or so.

really awful feelings, daily basis, even when just laying in bed i was feeling them and suffering.

3. i am currently a bit better but really still unwell. i do 10-15% of what i used to do when i was ""normal"" (loved reading, wide cultural knowledge, high grades, practiced some sport etc). i wake up feeling awful and it lasts till the afternoon/evening. after that i am a bit better, slightly. head very very unwell, body unwell, forcing myself to do stuff and act normal. almost 24h/24 (those feelings).

i would like to know your insight on this please, willing to answer any question, thank you so much ! urgent, does all this seem to be chronic anxiety?"
243,0,"I’m not sure if this post is allowed, I’ve read over the community rules so please excuse my ignorance if this post isn’t okay.

I just wanted to have a discussion about products that have helped a little with your anxiety. I just want to make it clear that I don’t believe in quick fixes and for me personally, I take holistic approach to dealing with my anxiety (medication, CBT, physical activity, meditation, etc.)

Having said that I have found some products that have helped to relieve some symptoms for me, particularly in regards to sleep or at least make me feel more comfortable. These include:

* weighted blanket- I read about these online and half thought that maybe it was just a scam but I was curious and went ahead and purchased one anyway. I’ve genuinely found it really comforting. I have issues with sleep and it helps to make me feel safe and slow down some of the thoughts in my head, making it a little easier to sleep.

* Aromatherapy diffuser- Again this is something that calms me down a little. I suppose it has something to do with being able to concentrate or even being distracted by the smell or maybe even an association with calmness. Just quickly, I don’t believe essential oils are medicinal cure alls but I’ve found it to be somewhat calming.

Have you guys had any experience with products that have helped relive symptoms or make you more comfortable? I’m really interested to know.

245,0,For the past 4 or 5 years I have literally had no friends. I’ve had a boyfriend for about 3 years and live with him and my immediate family. My bf works all day and I do some work from home. I hang out with my brother sometimes during the day since it’s summer then my bf or alone the rest of the time. I really love being alone and I have absolutely no desire to ever strike up a conversation with anyone or get to know anyone. I know most of it’s due to my extreme social anxiety and GAD - my fear of talking to people out in public or strangers is overwhelmingly terrifying. It is so hard for me to find the benefit in friendships. So I just was wondering how important it really is to have friends throughout life and how to get out of the mindset of never needing them. Is it that bad to have no friends?

So this mostly happens whenever I have dinner together with my family. I'm a teenager, and live at my house with 2 parents and a sibling. Every morning when I have breakfast, I mostly eat it alone. I would like to keep it that way though. I eat my lunch at school, most of the times with some friends. Now, everytime I eat dinner, we always eat it with the 4 of us. My mom always tries to have a chat about something, my dad (sometimes) tries to do that as well, but rather stays silent. He also isn't always home. My brother never speaks at dinner. He has 'mysophonia' (hope it is a good translation). It basically means that you can get annoyed with sounds really fast, and he mostly has it when eating. He hears my mom, dad, and me chewing, and he gets very annoyed by that. Because of that, he doesn't talk. Now, I try to talk during dinners because I feel guilty for not talking back when my mom tries so hard to start a conversation. But I've noticed that it really makes me tired, so sometimes during the meals I don't talk at all.

The meeting itself was just to really meet people and get an idea of who's generally interested in playing certain types of games. Now the meeting wasn't so bad all in all. I didnt talk much, but everyone was really nice (I'm just extra awkward). The only thing is, now everyone is on a discord server talking about what games they want to play, and a bunch of people share a lot in common with me (weed, veganism, most are lgbt).

254,0,"idk if I have seen anyone else out there have anything similar to this, so I have decided to make my own post. 

I am currently experiencing the worst, most crippling constant anxiety I have ever had. It started about a month ago when my friends dad passed unexpectedly. I'm not sure why this jolted me the way it did, but it did. I have been unable to eat, sleep, drink, or do any kind of work unless every single person in my family is at home. I'm constantly dreading each day because I know that with a new day, comes a new person getting up to leave for work. even if they are five minutes late home, I immediately catastrophize and start panicking. once, my mother was late home from work and I vomited from worry. I am incredibly emotionally drained and exhausted, and I just cannot wait for each day to end. I feel like this is no way to live, so I need to know if anyone out there has ever experienced anything similar. my worst fear, probably ever, is having a loved one go missing. this is why I am constantly messaging people to find out their location, and when they don't reply, I go into full blown panic mode. I am worried so often that I feel physically ill, and I have tried talking to my parents but they chalk it up to over reacting. I just cannot see any joy in anything anymore, because I'm so constantly worried about who will be home when. I'm 16, and I am unbelievably jealous of my friends around me who don't experience this. sometimes, when someone talks about an issue I immediately think ""well at least your not dead"". I am consumed by mortality, and not even my own. I couldn't care less if I died, other then I would be worried it would have on my family. please help, I'm so, so lost and I can't find anyone else who feels this way. life ruining fear of losing people"
255,0,"So, I have always had a pretty miserable memory. However, it started going downhill even more a couple of years ago, and I believe that it's not actually a memory issue, but a memory recall issue caused by anxiety. At this point, most times when I have to think about something to put together a concept or even remember what I ate in the morning, I can feel my stomach drop and I start to panic, thinking ""what if I can't remember this? I should remember this. Oh god, by now I should have been able to answer this question \[to myself or to the person I'm having a conversation with\]. I'm looking stupid. I haven't even started to think about this, *why can't I think straight.*""  
Obviously, with my brain being blocked by all these anxious thoughts, I end up completely unable to even try and actually come up with an answer, increasing, therefore, the anxiety, and so on.   
When this problem started out, it only happened occasionally, but by now, I have it all the time. I find myself unable to do easy maths such as 7\*6 sometimes, simply because my brain freaks out about the possibility of me *not* knowing the answer. It also leads to me not being able to properly listen to people. Earlier, someone tried to explain a game to me, and all my brain did was scream ""what if you won't be able to understand this, they will think you're stupid"". Obviously, I didn't actually hear a single word of what they said.   


Does anyone know how to overcome this? My only ""trick"" so far is writing everything down and basically ""thinking"" on paper, but it takes an immense amount of time and obviously doesn't help in face-to-face conversations. I'm so tired of this, I just want it to stop. Any tip is appreciated. Thank you.

Im always sad, really, really anxious, randomly tired, lonely (even if im with my absolute best friends) and my inner voice is just being a bitch, telling me I suck every single day of my life. And I dont know if I should post this in a mental health thread, because Im probably overreacting like I always do, but I just hate the present version of me and I need to share, Im sorry if it isnt appropriate. 

Since I was really young, I have a theory that every person is like a circle, divided in three parts: intelligence, likeability and beauty and what distinguishes us is the percentage of every part. And maybe you will think this is stupid, but I always knew how my circle was defined: I majorly had the brains, kinda had the likeability and I lacked in looks. And I was okay with this. But now, Im going through a though time in college, my friends stopped caring about me (not their fault, I just havent been doing great)  and I guess Im actually getting prettier. So, for the first time in my life, I have no idea who I am or how my circle is doing and Im freaking out about it. And with this, Im pushing every single person that likes me away.

You probably just think Im exaggerating and you are probably right, but I just want to know how every people on the planet go through this kind of stuff.

Last night, I got tired of the mess and started cleaning for the first time in like a year. I started to get really excited for what the apartment would look like once cleaned and kept at it until I needed a quick break.
When I sat down, I felt wrong for resting. It needed to be done, but I had work in the morning  and needed to get to bed. I couldn't sleep much and woke up feeling lethargic and foggy. I didn't focus on what I did last night, only on what needed to be done. Before I left the house, I got overwhelmed looking at what still needed to be done.

So I sent her one last one saying that if she didn't want me in her life, that's fine. But at least respond because I can't handle the anxiety of where things were left. She responded with this:


""I don’t owe you anything. Idk why you think anybody owes you anything or that you owe people something. You’re so concerned about everyone else and why. For what. You’re wasting your days by having so much anxiety and panic attacks over what?? I told you I don’t want to deal with it. The constant shaming of yourself. Every other text is something negative. I don’t like that. I used to be like that too. I was in an unhealthy relationship and was ruining my life. Every day I sulked around wishing people would feel sorry for me.

Now, I’ve been so sad, feeling like I can’t separate my dreams from my reality and I can’t go out anymore without feeling like I’m gonna throw up or pass out. I love being with my bf, going to the movies, sing, play guitar, going by myself to eat some delicious food at local restaurants but now I can’t do that without starting to feel dizzy, numb hands and mouth, shakiness. 

I went to the doctor last week and he told me that maybe I was anemic. Went for a blood test and today, again at the doctor, told me everything is fine (which makes me feel like it’s all in my head)...

“Maybe you are pregnant” he said but I did a pregnancy test a week ago and it was negative. 

Talking about my problems at home, post trauma stress from my mothers death and inestable relationship with my boyfriend he suggest going to therapy ASAP. 

I’m going to do an appointment for that and he prescripted sertraline for now and I hope it makes me feel good. I’m a little scared about my body now, I feel like I can’t control it, but I want to be me again. I just feel like I’m going crazy, but I really hope I get better.

Sorry for posting here, I'm not normally one to share any feelings that I have but I feel like I'm losing control and would like just to know if it's me or not.

A year ago almost to the weekme and my wife lost a baby in pregnancy... I had issues with work making redundant from being a manager and my eldest son trying to kill himself. Sorry I'm not venting just trying to say where I was at.

My wife took the loss really hard and so did I, but I had to look after her and my 5 kids and as such had a breakdown.

My work was understanding and when I came back gave me an admin roll with 0 stress. About a week ago I was just saying to family that I still don't feel like me, my drive to push has never come back and it feels like everything is weighing me down.

But it's gone from we want you to take over in a few weeks to you will be on your own in 2 days, I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack and I don't know why... I also feel like I'm being stupid and for lack of a better description a cry baby.... Dies anyone else understand this or is it me being stupid? Am I being stupid?"

But, now i think or feel like i am experiencing some sort of social anxiety coz i can't face people for long time (I've started doing internship where everyone is older than me so i sit there for 7-8 hrs straight without any interaction). Also i feel like i am losing my mind, like i dont feel this(life) is all 'real' and feel that something is beyond all this which is the ultimate reality. Due to these thoughts i find it difficult to be happy in this life somehow.

275,0,"I participated in my colleges commencement ceremony, I had everything I needed to graduate, but today I got an email from my uni saying that I didn’t have enough credits and needed to take more courses aka I can’t be awarded my degree (at my school, you get the degree in the mail no matter what-we get a placeholder during the ceremony). my school has given me HELL before for studying abroad even though I chose a program affiliated with the school, I got every course I took abroad approved by department heads to be transferred back and I went through all the right steps. I’m trying to fight it, but the thought of having to take more classes, even just one or two, makes me wanna scream. I barely made it through my “last” semester unscathed. even with therapy and anti-anxiety meds, I had more anxiety attacks during this “last” semester than I did for years. I also feel so humiliated to have participated in the ceremony (which cost about $100 for the grad app fee and cap/gown) only to be told it was all in vain. I’ve had plenty of issues with my uni prior times that left me feeling terrible and I was looking forward to no longer dealing with them.

277,0,"If you want to know the details check the only other post I’ve made on a relationship advice subreddit. It’s a long, long story and it’s only gotten worse since then.

My basic run down is I have an ex who was, and still is being confusing. Struggling to move on and sort through my feelings due to anxiety, which is having me overthink everything.

I’m really scared I’ll be stuck loving him forever, despite the fact that he seems like he’s already moved on. I’m scared I’ll never meet someone like him, and I’m scared I will. I’m scared he’s already moved on despite a month ago holding me crying and asking me to never stop loving him. I’m scared that he’s truly happier without me, and I’m scared he’s not. I’m scared I’ll never find someone that’ll work out for me, or that I’ll end up in a bad relationship and won’t be able to get out. I’m scared I’m going to feel this hurt, pain, and betrayal forever.
I’m scared to forget about him and I’m scared to never forget. I’m scared that, when he said he couldn’t talk to me anymore, it’s because he hated me. I’m scared he’s going to find a new girl soon and look at her and say all the same things he said to me.
I want him to be happy, but my brain is running wild. I’m very lost, hurt, and anxious out of my mind.
I’m not sure how to deal with this, even after talking to people about it. I’m worried this is going to keep getting worse. Is there any way to calm this? These racing thoughts? My heart just never seems to wanna give it up. Dealing with a breakup, really scared I’ll feel this way forever or never find someone again"

Me, having OCD once again has to use 2 seperate wipes to clean off the controller. Keep in mind, i'm scrubbing this controller pretty hard.. like to the point where it's getting soapy. I put the batteries back in and try to turn on the controller but for some reason it wont turn on. I keep trying to turn it on and it suddenly starts smoking. I take the batteries out, set it down and go back to bed where i'm now typing this. The controller is still in the same room as me. Is the smoke that came out dangerous? Getting really worried. Afraid i'm breathing in toxic smoke."
283,0,"Does anyone else find themselves feeding off other people's moods, and heightening your anxiety? As well as having anxiety, I'm also an empath. The majority of people can feel empathy and understand what other people are going through, but some of us are especially sensitive. I'm not trying to blow my own trumpet here or sound pretentious. I'm not unique - there are tons of people like me, so I wondered if anyone struggled to cope with this *and* their anxiety?

Being a highly sensitive, empathetic person is mostly a hindrance. It doesn't take a lot of effort for me to be affected by other people's emotions, so much so that they feel *real* to me. This has triggered panic attacks, which felt really silly because I had to keep reminding myself that *I wasn't actually part of the problem*, whatever it was.

One example was when a friend of mine was lost in an unfamiliar city, and they called me because they knew I was up so they could talk to someone. They were fine, just unnerved. I know how uncomfortable I feel in situations like that, and all night, I felt a heaviness in my chest. I felt a sense of anxiousness and unease because I knew that was how my friend felt, and I didn't calm down until I got a text from them to say they were safe in their hotel.

I have a friend with anxiety, but they aren't as badly affected by situations like this. Their anxiety stems from their own situations and their own feelings. This isn't a bad thing - it's personal to them. I'm just one of the many unfortunate people who aren't only impacted by my own anxiety, but other people's circumstances as well.

When I’m alone it’s usually manageable until my brain starts ruminating on past events or feelings that pissed me off, then my mind is off to the fucking races, creating fake arguments and hostile scenarios in my head that only piss me off more.

It unfortunately all revolves around my poor goddamn girlfriend, because she is pretty much the only human I interact with on a day to day basis. I work from home and have no friends in the area whatsoever. I can’t take a joke from her, I can’t take criticism, and my feelings of love and joy are hampered by this goddamn sour feeling that’s always inside of me. I walk on eggshells around her, and try to not talk about my feelings because most of them are unreasonable. But as you know, you HAVE to talk about your feelings, or else they get bottled up and become poison. And I know she now walks on eggshells around me because of how much of a sour bitch I can be.

I’m on medication (Trintellix, Vistsril as needed) and I hope to god this starts getting better soon. All my moods lately are just sour, no joy, no love, no ease, no relaxation. Fuck this. Goddamn irritability. I’m pissed about how much I’m pissed. (A rant)"

301,0,"Hi, all. So, maybe it’s just me and I’m overthinking and worrying about details that actually aren’t a big deal. 

For some background, last year (sophomore year of college, 2018) I went to my nurse on campus and was diagnosed with severe anxiety. I started taking Zoloft, if I remember correctly, but stopped taking it due to:

1.) Side effects

2.) I told my mom everything - I’ve always felt like a “nervous child” and like a worrier - but this was the first time that I had actually been diagnosed. Some days are better than others as far as nervousness, worrying, etc. goes, but my mother told me that she didn’t think I have anxiety, and I that I shouldn’t take the prescribed medication (although I did anyway to see if it would help).

I’m beginning to feel like I’m at my wit’s end. Any advice or other comments would be very much appreciated.

A few questions &amp; statements, I suppose:

- Some things that I feel that make me think I may have anxiety, but I’m not certain. Am I just overreacting? 
* When I get nervous, my stomach hurts, I feel nauseous, dry mouth, shaky hands, sweaty, upset stomach.
* I’m scared of answering a phone call or sending/checking an email, talking to people, making/initiating conversations, etc..
* I worry that my “friends” find me annoying or see me as a burden, or that the people I work with don’t really like me.
* I worry about the future.
* A few other phobias that keep me up at night.

- I’ve had a rough day, so it may not be helping my head space. I’m considering going back to my on-campus doctor when school starts, but I’m worried that I’m just overreacting to my feelings, and that nothing is actually wrong.
* For those who have taken anxiety medicine and experienced multiple side effects, is this normal, or is this a sign that you shouldn’t be on medication?
* If I end up seeking and needing help, I worry about my mom. Yes, I’m an adult, but I’m not sure how or if I should bring it up to her if that’s the case. Any advice?

302,0,When my anxiety is bothering me a lot I’ve found that moving air (like fans or being in a car with the windows down really calms me down). I sleep with two fans on every night no matter how cold it is outside and I always drive with the windows down unless the weather is bad. I find that air hitting my face is very comforting and helps me relax. I can not stand to be in a room or car that is all shut up with no moving air it makes me feel like I’m suffocating.

303,0,"So my anxiety about work has been awful the last couple of months. I have bad health anxiety, among other things, and my dad passed away last year, my mom has had a brain tumor and open heart surgery, just a lot of things have happened to make me basically feel like I'm going to die at any moment. I have a good job that has become stressful in the last 8 months or so. My boss has had criticism for me, etc. I've done what I feel like is my best to improve, but I finally had a very bad anxiety/depressive episode that has lasted several weeks. I missed 3 days of work and I already had an attendance writeup before this. My boss said I have to be there tomorrow, she sent me a separate email saying we would have to talk about all my appointments (I've had dental work done recently), and then today my coworker forwarded me an email from the boss because she thought she just forgot to include me, but the email said to make sure we have coverage after 5pm (only 4 of us work till that time). We also recently hired 2 new people so I feel like the writing is on the wall. I'm depressed because I liked this job a lot a few months ago and this won't be the first time I've gotten fired for anxiety related attendance. I've already applied for some jobs but has anyone else been through this due to anxiety? I'm terrified to go in tomorrow morning. Probably getting fired tomorrow"
304,0,"This is nothing new for me but it doesn't make it any easier every time it happens. To make a long story short I go thru periods where I think my friends aren't really my friends. I'm anxious and paranoid that they talk behind my back and rather keep me at a distance. Whether they were only friendly to me out of pity and now are trying to distance themselves from me. 

I go over my every interaction with them and try to think at what point did I make them mad? Did I say something to offend them?  Why all of a sudden they make plans without me or read my messages and don't answer me back? I know I shouldn't be upset about them making plans without me, but it still hurts. Especially since we did eveything together.  What changed, what did I do wrong? 

I play ""detective"" I look into details (messages, message time stamps, talking to other mutual friend/neighbor) that just reinforces my idea they don't actually like me.

 I also have a suspicion that my friend 1 who has been more distant than the other (friend 2) has been trying to make plans with my neighbor without me, who is also my friend that I introduced to friend 1. My neighbor, who has known me for much longer than her, showed me her conversation she had with her today about asking to make plans with her. When my neighbor mentioned about me going too friend 1  said ""whatever, she will probably be cleaning"". Which I say occasionally to people when they ask what my plans are on the weekend. Not an excuse to get out of plans.

I don't know, I just feel kind of crappy about the whole thing.  I sort of hope it's all in my head , then at least my friends are still my friends and I'm not as shitty of a person as I thought. I hate thinking like this. I hope there's someone out there that has gone thru the same thing that I can relate too. Are my friends really my friends?"

316,0,"I've never really been someone that's naive and trust people without hesitation. But with recent things, I have had a hard time believing simple things. Not just like a compliment, but mostly that people have good intentions when they do or say things. Like for example they don't hold the door and they apologize, but your mind goes ""no they did that on purpose"". But then also bigger things, like someone says you did a good job and your mind goes ""they just surprised that you can perform a simple task"". I'm talking to a professional about this stuff but I don't have the language to make it make sense, if that means anything. It's the first time in a while where I haven't been able to see people as just using me, and keeping me in their lives just until they have taken what they wanted from me.

It wasn’t until 18 I was officially diagnosed with GAD and MDD. 

Sadly it runs in my family but it seems to have hit me the hardest out of anyone else. Everyone else tends to have seasonal depression.

323,0,"I have a question because I'm not sure if this is just me. I've always had social anxiety, even since I was a really little kid. The farthest back I can remember having anxiety about interacting with people was around 5yo. I remember around 13, I wouldn't be able to walk down the same sidewalk if someone was coming the other way. I'd cross the street so I wouldn't have to interact with them. 

Now for my adult life, I'm still experiencing it I think. I talk to people easily now but I have something I can only describe as a rebound effect. 

I can talk to someone and have a really great conversation but then for the next few days have anxiety and panic attacks because I feel almost like I gave too much of myself away, even if the conversation was totally normal. It's not like I become very vulnerable at all. It's like if anyone knows anything more than bare basics about me or my perspectives or behaviors, I feel like I have to hide from the world. 

Does anyone else experience this? 

I'm definitely going to talk to my therapist about it next time I see him, but I wanted some advice. Does your anxiety get worse after being too social?"

328,0,"The only time I can relax even a little is when I’m completely immersed in my video games. Everywhere else in my life, school, work, and most especially, home, just stresses me the hell out. 

I feel like I have to hide everything. No one has ever really accepted me for who I am, least of all myself. I worry every day that no one can ever really appreciate me. The only person anyone likes is the mask.

That’s all right, though. I’ve always planned on living alone. It’s not that I don’t enjoy spending time around people, it’s just that I’ve never met anyone who enjoyed spending time with me. So I’d rather not be a burden. I don’t deserve it.

——————————————

Ive been wanting to try learning an instrument recently. I lost all my muscles for playing trumpet after I gave up in high school. I also don’t have the muscles or skill to play my harmonica very well. I was never good at music. I never really tired.

When I reflect on this, it’s because I was always too afraid of sounding bad to ever even practice. I was too afraid to be vulnerable, even around my family.

I’ve found a bit of an escape, though. When I sit in my dad’s car, alone in an empty parking lot, there isn’t anyone to judge me. So that is the only place I’m able to learn to play.

It’s strange, though. I’d never wanted to play an instrument before. The only reason I ever did in the past was because my parents made me. But I’m learning to dissociate from them, and for what feels like the first time in my life, I’m starting to grow.

I think that ultimately, I’ve been wanting to play so that I’d have something that I could enjoy with other people. As pathetic as that sounds to me, it is probably as good a reason as any. The worst thing seems to be that I have nowhere that I’m comfortable. I have nowhere and no one with which I can be vulnerable."
329,0,"So, my boyfriend of about a year and I both have clinical anxiety. I’ve been a well-healing cookie and am being weaned off meds. He recognized a problem on his end and told me about it and he took his meds for about 2 months before deciding he’s all better. I tried getting him to go back, but some things you have to learn the hard way. 

Well, it’s blown up spectacularly. Everything was going just fine and then around 2 weeks ago he started withdrawing due to anxiety about moving away. The first time he didn’t reply to a text for 48 hours, I asked if he was alive and he replied and seemed to make an effort to check in more. Then, in the same week, he did it again and I asked if he was alive and he didn’t reply within 12 hours. So, my alarm bells go off and I google his mom’s phone number and his sister’s because I think he might really be in trouble. 

Well, according to his mom, he packed up early to move and was on his way to his new city near her. Rationally, he’s definitely fleeing but he’ll be safe near family and call me later. However, feeling abandoned is a major trigger for my anxiety. I’m able to stop myself from doing anything for about 12 hours but finally I accuse him of ghosting me. 

Then he tells me he’s having severe anxiety and my calls and texts aren’t helping so I back off and go back to being a trainwreck in front of my friends and family. I do pretty good (for me) again waiting 5 days but can’t take it anymore. I give him 24 hours to give me where he’s at and when he doesn’t reply I send him as compassionate a breakup text as I can so I can get out of this. He reels me back in a day later because we actually have a mutually compassionate discussion about what’s going on and I don’t actually want to break up. And then he’s withdrawn again and my anxiety is back, too.

We’re in a hell loop. I feel like I’m being tortured. Is there anyway to break out with this relationship intact or is leaving the right thing to do? I love him so much but we can’t continue like this much longer. Trying to break out of an anxiety feedback loop"

I’m bored of being broke. I’m bored of being hungry. I’m bored of all the formalities and constant hoops to jump through having arrived in a new country; they’re never straightforward. I’m bored of staying home because of the lack of energy we have to do anything due to either being hungry, depressed, anxious, not wanting to spend any of the little money we have, or all of the above. I’m bored of living out of a suitcase while we haven’t yet secured a home for ourselves. I’m bored professionally, returning to hospitality work due to little opportunity that’s come my way since arriving in a new location. I’m bored with one of us at any time needing to be taken care of due to depression and/or anxiety. I’m bored with the lack of fun and sex we’re having due to all these stresses.

I’m impatient waiting for our first pay days to arrive. I’m impatient waiting to not constantly feel hungry. I’m impatient waiting to finish the seemingly never ending admin, establishing myself in a new place. I’m impatient waiting for our energy to return, that most certainly will having relinquished all this boredom and impatience. I’m impatient to move into a proper home and unpack everything, feeling settled. I’m impatient to work on a project again I actually give a shit about. I’m impatient for our mental health to improve. I’m impatient to have a date night and bring some excitement and fun back into our lives; one of the reasons we’ve fancied each other from the get go.

334,0,Hi I need advice :))) so I started a new job 3 weeks ago and for the most part it’s been okay (keep in mind this is a second job &amp; I have another job as well that I loooove). My manager gave me my schedule for July and August and I’m basically working everyday to cover her staffs shifts since everyone is so busy. The training is all online and HR controls it. Something was wrong with their system so I just got my training this week. I have only had 3 shifts where I shadowed staff. Yesterday was my first day working ALONE!!! I have not even completed my training yet and this manager puts me on the job alone already omg anyways... I feel so clueless and slow and the community center I work at gets so fuckin busy. Yesterday 2 people called me slow and stupid because the line was OUTSIDE the door. I have to help the customers who are registering for stuff while also taking payments and stamping/banding a whole ass line of LITTLE KIDS going swimming. The other staff memeber who came after was also busy and I just felt like such a bother... I could tell that he was getting annoyed bc I was “slow”..I was getting  yelled at by everyone and I felt so dumb. I’m a pretty aggressive person and don’t take shit from people so I fought back but after my shift I literally sat and cried in my car. Ugh I just feel like such shit and I’m actually having nightmares about this job. I can’t think about it without cringing and getting an unbelievable wave of sadness. I have never hated a job so much. I got this job because the pay was supposed to be a lot better than my current job only for me to find out that I’m actually getting paid the same amount as my other job UNTIL the manager thinks I’m good enough to work alone? That wasn’t mentioned in my contract. ANYWAYS I desperately want to quit &amp; I want die inside when I think about my upcoming shift. My problem is.. idk if it’s my anxiety acting up?? Am I just a quitter? will this affect my career in the long run? I’m over thinking everything but I feel bad bc she already made the whole schedule UGH I DONT WANT TO RISK MY MENTAL HEALTH. When I stress out I dissociate and I can’t already feel my dissociating getting worse . Is it bad to quit in such a short time??? How do I even tell her omg pls help me I’m going crazy thinking about this. Quitting a job I started 3 weeks ago
335,0,"Hi

i take adderall XR 15mg, intuniv 1mg, abilify 10mg, and anafranil 25mg.

I can't really increase my antidepressant further (and in general) without ruining the desirable effect I get from adderall and then it becomes a game of increasing one, and then the other, and so forth.

Abilify 20mg doesn't do anything different from 10 or 15mg for me. And increasing my intuniv would further wreck my sex drive.

I don't want to take my prescribed gabapentin right now because i suspect it causes adderall to also not work. Plus it only helps a tiny bit at 300mg otherwise it doesn't do anything else and just makes me loopy which i don't like. Although im looking forward to when i can try Lyrica as it literally just went generic today

I can't take propranolol because i take intuniv and my doc has previously said taking both at the same time would be dangerous for my blood pressure

I have also tried buspar, atarax, seroquel, risperdal, lamictal, various other antidepressants (prozac, luvox, paxil, zoloft, cymbalta, effexor, lexapro). pretty much what im on now is the result of five years of exhaustive psychiatry and trial/error for my condition.

my problem, in short, is that i still panic when i react to responsibility, expectations, anything that isn't completely slacking off. this is just my personality, on adderall, off adderall, still the same

i dont get panic attacks but it freaks me out to do anything productive, even with adderall

which is why ive tried everything i can afford and then some, and ask this question today How do I ask for a benzo from my doctor? (I also take adderall + other meds)"

337,0,"I’ve been in a relationship for 3 years. We had a baby a year and a half in. Before I got pregnant I was working two jobs, driving my dads Camaro, had no bills at all. We had a lot of fun during that time and that’s when our relationship was the strongest. Well fast forward, I’ve been a stay at home mom since my daughter was born and I’ve gone down hill since then. My anxiety and depression is a lot worse, my self body image is terrible, my relationship is rocky. I’ve recently acquired a new friend that’s been pushing me to go to the gym (thank god for her because my motivation is non existent) we usually go at least a few times a week. I also try and do workouts at home when I’m feeling motivated. But other than the gym, I don’t leave the house very often. My boyfriend takes my car to work so I can’t leave anyway. My boyfriend is usually the one to go out for things and I let him because he will. If I was alone, I’d do it myself though. Since I’ve felt so secluded, hidden and cut off from the world, my anxiety is at an all time high. Most especially in a social setting, like before we go hang out with friends, I’ll have anxiety from the moment I wake up and realize I have to go do that. That puts a lot of stress on my bf. I guess I just miss the old me and old life I had. I had anxiety still but it was more manageable than this. I’ve been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist but even doing that scares me. I haven’t answered my phone, unless I know who it is, in months because it’s so bad. All of my social accounts have barely any activity from me, other than Snapchat, which I still barely post anything. Half the time I feel like my bf’s acquaintances don’t even know he’s dating someone. I guess I just need encouragement to grow a set and take on this life like an adult. It’s hard because I can tell myself all of this but it doesn’t stop the gut-wrenching/million butterfly/nauseous feeling of anxiety from coming back. I’ve tried breathing techniques, analyzing and identifying the room, telling myself I’m okay and it’s just anxiety. At this point I feel like medication might be my best option, even though going to see someone for it makes me so nervous and anxious. I just want to live a productive, happy, healthy life and my anxiety is ruining that for me. 

Sorry there’s not really a question and it’s long. I just feel like I need to put all of this out into the world, even if it’s just reddit and nobody knows who I am! 

If you’ve made it this far, leave some technique you use for your anxiety.

339,0,"I have discovered a drug in the beta blocker class that seems to help immensely with panic and anxiety. It’s called propanolol and pretty much blocks the absorption of adrenaline so your don’t have the regular fight or flight response soon as you get nervous, which has helped me a lot because soon as I realize my heart isn’t about to explode from panic I regain control. This drug blocks shaky hands , sweating, fast heart rate due to nerves. And allows you to be smooth as possible, at least better than usual in my case. 5-10 mg before driving or anything that would make me nervous has helped me greatly. There is also some studies done where this can help greatly with treatment of PTSD in combat soldiers, read into it! Anyone with bad social anxiety look into this"

342,0,"Hey all, a little bit of a frustrated rant here.

I just recently spent some time with family (which I try to do very minimally usually), and it seems as though EVERY time we get together they talk about what a skittish kid I was and how scared I was of absolutely everything and anything. Another thing that always gets brought up is my fidgeting habits or my old eating habits (I never used to like my food to touch and would panic whenever it would). I don't usually mind this and never really thought much of it. But then I got to wondering, why in the hell did my family never think that there was anything wrong with me then??? I always thought my anxiety came on recently during University and after my dad passed away, but it seems as though it's always been a part of me and nobody thought to do anything about it. Nobody was looking for these signs or even concerned that I was always scared of nervous about SOMETHING. My family even has a history of mental health problems, my mom is taking medication for both depression and anxiety. My grandmother is on medication for depression and anxiety. My father took antidepressants. And yet here we are, 24 years later and I am STILL struggling and STILL get irrationally nervous or scared. I've grown up always thinking that this is just who I was and that's just the way that I am when it doesn't have to be and that's why this is hurting so much. I can be more than just my anxiety, I've just never been shown how. It's frustrating that as a child no one ever thought to intervene or even questioned it and instead just accepted that as who I was, when I could've been so much more.

I dunno if anyone else has ever had this experience, if you have I would love to hear from you. I'm feeling pretty angry at them all right now and would love some consolidation. Thanks for getting this far if you did &lt;3 Family and Anxiety"
343,0,"I was wondering if anyone else lives in a city where there’s a community of people of your ethnicity? Except you all kinda know each-other and drama and private business gets around? Like it makes me anxious when I’m around these ppl and go to events because frankly, ppl are judgmental. My mom is also kinda suffering from these kinds of ppl not directly but indirectly. Like she stopped going to events and the temple because of people who don’t like her or whatever. I’m not sure what her deal is, but it’s making me nervous. I’m supposed to go to the temple this Saturday for the Dalai Lama’s birthday celebration and it makes me anxious knowing I have to go there and be around this community. Idk, it’s not bad but it’s not that welcoming anymore to me. Part of it is because I’m not skinny, I’m not a crazy smart student, and I’m not majoring in STEM. So people tend to look down on others, but I could just be overthinking that part. Idk, I just can’t wait to graduate and do something I know I’ll enjoy for the rest of my life.

344,0,"Web sites online like to talk about chest ""pressure"" and ""pain"", but sometimes I don't get that.  
It's more of ""weird"" feelings that's hard to describe, and I was wondering if anyone else gets these randomly?  


1. Internal chest tremor - Sometimes, while sitting, there seems to be a mild chest tremor inside the chest that randomly starts up, causing a nervous feeling and the slight feeling of shortness of breath. Is it a mild anxiety attack?
2. Sensitive sternum - Sometimes when I take deep breaths, my sternum/center chest area feels sensitive to the cool air going in. Creates for a tingly, uncomfortable feeling. I just read about costochondritis today, so maybe that's it?
3. Sore left chest and left arm - I sometimes get this when driving. I recall reading other people getting this too. Since it happens during certain situations, like driving, I'm guessing it's just anxiety?
4. Chest congestion - It feels sort of like a stomachache, but in the chest instead. The muscles around the chest area feel tight and I keep wanting to stretch. Sometimes it feels like my rib cage/sternum is too small and I wanna stretch it out to get a better breath.
5. Empty chest - Sometimes my chest feels numb, like it's an empty space and nothing is there.

Just wondering if anyone else gets feelings like this, or just generally ""weird"" feelings in the chest area that's not pain?

I take things that people say so literally and internalize it so that it fits my situation and I start feeling insecure. I also find it hard to let things go even though I want to so bad.  I know all of these things are wrong and its just blocking me from reaching my full potential in all aspects of my life.

I’ll look at my parents and feel like they aren’t who I think they are which spirals me further into my delusion. Another way I can kind of describe is it that I am living in a Truman Show kind of world. 

I also worry about death a lot. I’m agnostic so I don’t know what happens after death and that scares me a lot. I don’t like uncertainty so that obviously doesn’t help. I just think it’s weird that you one day won’t exist whether your entire consciousness is gone or you’re somewhere else in heaven. I would love to be religious as that would solve a lot of my problems but I can’t force myself to believe in things. 

I have seen doctors about this and I am currently on Sertraline and Buspirone daily along with Atarax as I need it. I have also had a therapist for many years. 

I just graduated high school and have college coming up next year where I will be away from home but not too far. This could be the cause of my sudden spike of anxiety but I’m not sure. 

If you made it through this long post then feel free to share any similar occurrences you or someone else has had, advice, or tell me what kind of anxiety I have.  

Thank you so much. What kind of anxiety am I having?"
348,0,"So I am returning to school in September for computer programming. 

I have moderate amounts of savings that could last me months into the school year. That is actually the entire reason I've kept the job as long as I have. However, it has been having many negative effects on me and my mental/physical health.   


Some things I've noticed:  


\-Stress sweats

\-Tight chest

\-Really bad diarrhea poops almost daily (I looked it up and apparently this is caused by anxiety/stress? Sorry for the TMI)

\-I've gone from 160 pounds to 130 pounds and I think it's from stress and the poops

\-Generally has just made me less happy and enthusiastic about life

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially the people I work with are nice, amazing, caring. But the job itself and the understaffed nature of the store make it so stressful to work there. I could be covering cashier 3 times a shift, while also stocking shelves and dealing with customers/price checks/bringing in buggies. Sometimes it's just me in the entire grocery department and I have to handle frozen/dairy price checks too.  


Because there are only 2 months until school starts I am strongly considering quitting.   


Keep in mind I do want to work still and earn money during the school year, but it would probably be better to shoot for an on campus job or something a little less stressful than this one.  


I have many people telling me to face my ""anxiety"" which has never been formally diagnosed btw, but I feel as if this job is making things worse. I don't really have issues talking to others, I'm just a quiet person sometimes until I'm comfortable.  


Does anyone have any advice? Or if you have been through a similar situation yourself?  


Thanks :) Considering quitting grocery store job after 6 months"
349,0,"I started a new job today that includes a complete Change in environment, caliber, and a city commute. In my anxiety-fueled rush to get out the door I forgot to take my medication. There were so many things that challenged me today. I was deep breathing for practically 8 hours straight. I could feel my anxiety causing racing and distorted thoughts. BUT I survived. I may have been nauseated the entire time, but I made it. I can tell I've grown in recent years with therapy and experience. Still- took my meds as soon as I got home. On to day 2. New job today... Forgot my meds"
350,0,"I can’t remember a day where I could go out in public and make it the whole day without having a anxiety attack. I can’t talk without feeling like I’ve said something stupid and then think about it for hours. I went to the store today so I could get some new shorts for the summer. I was excited until I actually got in the store, it was awful. There were so much clothing racks that it was hard to even walk around comfortably. The lights were too bright, it gave me a headache. I quickly get some shorts and go to the fitting room. I’ve always had a hard time with fitting rooms. This one had the worst lighting, everything I tried on made me look ugly, and when I took the clothes off I felt even more ugly. Looking in the mirror made me depressed. I been down and anxious all day and now that I’m in the comfort of my own home I’m crying my eyes out. I wish I could runaway and be alone without the feeling of being lonely. Why can’t I just have one normal day?!?! I just want to runaway away and be alone."
351,0,"My entire team from my work is having a big team-bonding party at our local bowling alley and my manager made it very clear that she scheduled it specifically on day where no one had requests off/vacation days so that we could all make it. I know I'd be letting her down if I don't go, so I'm giving in and making myself go, but with it creeping up on me (it's tomorrow night) I'm getting more and more anxious about it. I'm worried about all the typical things that I normally worry about--I'll embarrass myself, I'll be the one person everyone ignores, and so on. 

I told her I'd go, and I want to challenge myself and stick it out. It'd be much appreciated if anyone had some party survival tips for us anxious people like me. What makes parties more bearable for you? Needed: your best advice for going to a party you can't get out of"
352,0,"I saw a video recently of an extremely dirty and horrible apartment infested with roaches, bugs, etc here on reddit. I've seen things like this before but something clicked in my brain and I was suddenly  terrified that my apartment will become infested with roaches and bugs. 

I've started to notice every crack and crevace they could come in. I'm scanning the floors for droppings. I'm cleaning EVERYTHING, cleaning crumbs, constantly looking out for signs of bugs. Truth is, i've been living here for 9 months and sure i've seen bugs but nothing to make me think I had an infestation. But over the past week it's all i've been thinking about and i've just been obsessing over how it could happen and what I could be doing to prevent it, even if there's really no current threat of it. How can I turn my brain off and not obsess over these thoughts and stop constantly be looking for signs of bugs and things. It's driving me mad. Any advice at this point is appreciated. Having obsessive thoughts about my apartment."
353,0,"I read something the other day that kind of struck home with me and has left me, I don’t know, shaken I guess. It’s definitely made me rethink a lot of things.

Obligatory tragic background story. (Also this is a throwaway account, I don't want to offend my family who know my real account) Since I was little I have not liked people to touch me. I can’t explain why I just always avoided it as best I could. I remember we used to have to shake hands with the Pastor and ushers as we were leaving church, and that was fine with me but there was this one older guy who would always want to hug me. I want to make clear that this was not a creepy thing, he hugged literally everyone, he was just a hugger. I didn’t get a creepy vibe from him or anything like that, in fact he was a really nice man. Anyway, I would literally get (what I now understand to be) a panic attack while waiting in line with my parents. I was like 8-9 years old then. My mom sort of acknowledged it, if I refused to hug someone she forced me to do it but jokingly explained to them that I ‘didn’t like hugs.’ They still forced me to hug people that we knew though. I tried to explain this to my parents but all my mother heard was that I somehow didn’t love her specifically. It’s not like it came out of nowhere I had been trying to tell her my whole life. It’s worse when I am stressed or upset. She tried to pat me on the shoulder once when I was upset and I literally shrank away from her and like shivered and got more upset and she got offended. 

It seemed to finally click with her, and I’m not kidding when I say this, my mom hasn’t touched me in about five years. She will even mockingly say to me, ‘I would hug you but I know how much you hate that.’ I know I hurt her by telling her that when I was younger but every once in awhile I wouldn’t mind a hug from her or something along those lines. I also don’t want to express this to her because I made such a big deal out of it before I don't want her to think I am lying. Also it hurts worse when I feel like I have to beg for affection because when I receive it then I can’t help but feel its disingenuous. 

It’s getting better, or else more along the lines that I can control it better. I get panic attacks if I am in a large crowd. For instance when we are at Disney and going into a theater for a show or something I wait and go in near the end and find a seat somewhere in the back without my family. I once had a panic attack in the line for Kali River Rapids and had to leave the line while my family stayed. 

The worst recently was when I was having a bad day at work already and a customer who I has helping kept putting his hand on my arm when he would ask a question and kept patting me on the back. I was nearly in tears when I was done helping him and had to go sit in my managers office and calm down. She asked me what was the matter and I said that I just didn’t like people touching me. My manager informed me that she had noticed that when I first started and she put her hand on my shoulder and I had tensed up immediately. She said she had made a point not to do that with me again because she understood, her son was the same way. 

Is this something that other people go through? How do you deal with it and your family and loved ones without hurting them? I just can’t seem to make people understand without making them upset with me. It’s so hard for me to show emotions so sometimes I just do my best not to show any. 

What I read the other day was along the lines of if your child doesn’t like to be touched and you force them to give hugs or endure other people invading their spaces they learn to associate touch with negative things. And how humans crave touch and what a horrific thing it must be for them to go through life craving something that they associate with negative feelings.

I wonder if that could be what happened to me and why it got worse. And then I wonder, could I have either PTSD or something else wrong with me. I can’t for the life of me remember names or faces. I have people who work for me and have for five or six years and will draw a blank when it comes to their names. I have two girls who look sort of alike, I can picture their faces but can’t consistently remember which face goes to which name without their name tags. Admittedly I don’t work with them often cause they are on the night crew. 

I also have very few memories from the time I was about 10-15 years old. Is that a thing, to selectively not remember things? Like if I try hard to remember something it’s like my mind bounces off of something and sort of glides over or is pushed over and I just go ‘oh well’ and move on. Which when I think about now is really disturbing. 

Whew, I know there is a lot to unpack here, sorry. I just want to know if these things are normal or if anyone else has experiences with this stuff. I guess I’m just feeling kind of lost now and trying to find way to reach out and figure out where to start to get back on track. Rethinking on some stuff and could use some advice please"
354,0,I recently learned about excessive peeing being a symptom of anxiety. Any tips for gaining control over my bladder? Some days I feel I have to pee every 30 minutes. It gets so much worse in long car rides or riding in the car with someone I’m not close with. Always needing to go pee-and sometimes feeling like your bladder is going to explode and only peeing for like 2 seconds??
355,0,"Hello,

Pre-note: diagnosed with anxiety and depression, currently taking fluoxetine 20mg.

  
I've not posted in here before but basically; I'd see if anyone had any similar experiences. So on Saturday, I was meant to go to work at noon. I went to the gym in the morning and was dreading work and being there for 8 hours and just interacting with co-workers. It got to 11, and I was home and got changed into my work clothes, and then I walked to work at 11:50. I started having a panic attack and didn't know what to do. I tried to get a hold of my friends, but no one was answering. After my panic attack calmed down I went into work, said hello to two of my co-workers, then thought to myself, I can't do this. I walked into the backroom to drop my bag off, and I saw the back door... I thought for less than a second and left through the back door. I went around the corner and started to have another anxiety attack again; it was awful. I then got called by my boss, but I didn't answer and then she text me and fired me for walking out of work. But I couldn't face trying to explain to her about my anxiety and such because I didn't expect anyone to understand.  
TLDR; had an anxiety attack just before work, so walked into work, then straight back out, ignored my boss and then got fired. Had an anxiety attack and ended up getting fired from work..."
356,0," So today I had a session and it seemed to hit me more than I thought it would. For background I have huge social anxiety, suicidal ideations/attempts (last one in DEC 2018), depression, trust issues all of that good s-hit.

Anyway recently I went home for the weekend (live 5 hours away) and my T. asked if I felt any connection or sense of loss when I say bye to my friends and family. I responded saying I dont really feel anything when I leave, Im happy to go home and be done with the constant visiting (going home means I have 15 people to spend time with in roughly a 36 hour window so its exhausting). So she asked a few more questions and it kind of dawned on me I dont feel a connection really with my friends and family. I love them but I just keep them at a distance because I dont want feel close to them (that probably dosnt make sense sorry). So that was one part of the session, me not feeling a connection to really anyone ever because I just dont trust people and if they leave I dont want to feel hurt or a sense of loss or anything. So she asked me to do something ANYTHING spontaneous (for me). Basically she told me just leave the house once this week for something other than errands or work. She wants me to do something before our next sessions (Friday). She suggested doing something for July 4th but the problem is I have no one to enjoy the fireworks with and I know if I go to some park that is shooting them all Ill be focused on is the couples and families enjoying each others company. Itll just make me depressed.

About 2 or 3 weeks ago we had a session where she gave me 'homework'. Ive talked how I would like to paint but when I did my first painting (Bob Ross) it turned out horrible and I havent painted sense. So she wanted me to paint again and show her. Ive been putting it off because I know its going to turn out horrible. I know Im a beginner but I mean its going ducking horrible. Anyway she asked if I have painted yet and I said no, she asked if I even wanted and I said I do but I just havent. I dont know how to keep doing this. I feel like Im disappointing her. Like why will she keep my as a client if it dosnt seem like Im trying. I'm just wasting her time.

I know I'm letting her down. I cant seem to pull myself out of w/e hole I've dug. I tried to cut back on drinking but now Im drinking again because I know I disappointed her. I dont know why I keep ducking up. Tough session today."
357,0,"Long story short, I made myself go to the ER (never done that before) because I thought I had something serious. Turned out to be pretty much nothing. I feel awful now, because the ER is so expensive and my girlfriend and I were trying so hard to save money. Now I blew it all by being a complete idiot. All I had to do was stop and think rationally about it. I feel like I can’t forgive myself this time, because usually when I get anxiety I just suffer for a few hours or days and then I’m over it, but this time it cost hundreds of dollars. I hate being me. Acted stupid due to anxiety, and now I’m paying for it"
358,0,"Many here have asked me about my full recovery from Anxiety and how I overcame Panic Attacks. Like many of you, I was on forums like these and facebook about 7-8 years ago after being diagnosed with panic attacks and anxiety. And just like you, after reading many posts about people suffering for years and years, and being told repeatedly I couldn't be cured, I had lost hope.

For recovery, I tried it all. I went to every medical specialist I could think of to find a root cause (primary care, GI doctors, Neurologists, ENTs, Psychiatrists), I went to many therapists, and even did alternative therapy like acupuncture, yoga, meditation, herbs and supplements, food sensitivities...you name, I'm sure I've tried it…Anti-depressants, anti-anxiety meds, ashwaganda, CBD, GABA pills, I’ve done it all.

I had found some relief, but unfortunately my anxiety was still there. And it was consuming my life. I would still feel like I was on the verge of another panic attack if I went outside my house, I still had physical sensations like palpitations, nausea, dizziness, stomach issues, and some really bizarre symptoms like feeling like my body was overheating. And it wouldn’t just be physical, I would even have exaggerated irrational thoughts that I couldn't get out of my head. No matter how many times doctors tried to assure me I was healthy, I would constantly think that because these feeling are so strong, I must have something terribly wrong with me.

I felt sorry for myself, I felt sorry for my family who I was irritated by my obsessiveness, and I felt sorry for others who had to see me suffer. This went on for a long time. I lost a lot of weight (45 pounds at my lowest), would never leave my house, and was constantly googling things trying to find the newest scientific research about curing anxiety.

Then, one day, I went to the ER (probably the sixth time) and got diagnosed with anxiety (again). I got sent home and on my way home I found some lpublished by some pioneers of anxiety treatment in the 60s. Pioneers include Claire Weekes, who inspired many others who suffered and fully recovered from Anxiety as well. These authors who wrote DARE and At Last a Life, and others. These ideas are revolutionary ideas about anxiety, which are still considered ahead of today's time.

This approach was different. It didn't focus on the cause of your anxiety or panic attacks. It was only focused on the solution. It did this without having to rely on medication or external tools and gave clear explanations about why you feel the way you do. These explanations focus on your nerves being sensitized. This is due from prolonged stress (right before your anxiety and during anxiety). Your nerves react to stress in an exaggerated way, which bring unusually intense feelings. These feelings include scary thoughts and physical sensations. This is combined with confusion. Confusion about why you feel the way you do. This confusion leads to fear, which leads to more anxiety. The approach was to accept the feelings without trying to figure out why your feeling the way you do. This allows your nerves time to heal. This had solid scientific bases and has been proven over and over to help people overcome panic attacks and anxiety permamently.

I followed this new approach, and after quite some time, I began to start feeling better. It wasn't overnight, and it was very VERY hard. It was very easy for me to go back to my old habits trying to figure things out. But unlike other cures, this approach was different. I felt better, slowly, but better. I kept this up for a long time. Overtime, I started seeing the light on the tunnel. I started going back to doing things I used to like. I began turning to my old self. Fast foward some time later, and I was back to my old self. Not only am I exactly the same as I was before, but better. This experience, it really taught me character. I can handle stress better now, I work harder, I’m happier. But most importantly, I’m free. I no longer worry about anxiety lurking in the shadows waiting to pop its head up. In fact, I haven’t had a panic attack in 7 years.

Now, this approach by itself wasn’t the only thing that helped me come out of anxiety and panic. Much of it was making constant mistakes and gaining my own insight. But this approach was essentially the foundation of my recovery.

Now I’m not naive to believe this works for everyone with Anxiety. Anxiety is so broad and has so many components, that painting this solution as a broad brush to everyone with anxiety is irresponsible. But many people are here because meds didn’t work for them, and therapy didn’t work either. Why not try a new approach?

It takes commitment, but the advantage is full recovery and freedom. You become your own therapist. You become your own cure.

Recently, I left my medical device engineering job to help other professionals struggling with panic attacks and anxiety. This problem is so common with so many people I felt that I had a responsibility to help others.

Listen to me. It’s not your fault that you are dealing with Anxiety and Panic Attacks. Often times, its because we have been convinced by society to find a quick fix or miracle cure where there isn’t one. When there isn’t one, we feel like we, ourselves, are to blame and that this it us forever.

One more thing, it’s important to realize that even knowing this knowledge itself is not going to lead to full recovery. You need someone who has been through recovery, who knows the what common roadblocks, and common mistakes are. Often times, we unknowingly self-sabotage our own recovery because of old habits of fear and worry. Having someone keep us accountable and making sure we don’t stray away from the approach is a big part of recovery.

Since I’ve started helping professionals overcome Anxiety and Panic Attacks, I’ve been working with people who have suffered for 20 or more years and hadn’t had any relief. Most often, only after working for just a few weeks, these individuals are making huge strides with this new approach and are on the road to full recovery. However, everyone is different, never forget.

I wish with all my heart you are able to overcome this and get some peace and freedom.

Thank you for reading. I hope my post inspires some hope and optimism in your recovery. Recognize that I read many of the posts on this forum and still felt like my anxiety and panic attacks were more severe…and yet, I was able to fully overcome them without any long term side effects.

A group like this can definitely help support each other :) A new approach to recovering from Anxiety"
359,0,"So I’ve been suffering from pretty bad anxiety for about 3 years now, it started from insecurity but a few months ago I accidentally smoked a THC vape pen that contained 90% THC and was Sativa which made my heart race and made me extremely anxious to the point I thought I was dying and had to go to the ER, they did an ECG and everything came out okay and it was just the withdrawal effects along with my own anxiety. Then i had a panic attack and then another bad panic attack. This made me have alot of health anxiety primarily focused on my heart. So i calmed down, started meditating, having a small workout everyday consisting of stretches and pushups and I haven’t had a panic attack since nor do i fear having one in the future but i fear this might have left me with health anxiety to the point where i google every dicomfort I feel, my chest discomfort has had an increase over these past few days. My symptoms are:

-unexpected chest discomfort, feeling like something is wrong with my heart

-hot rooms along with bright LED lights give me discomfort 

-Derealization

-Minor pain/discomfort in back of the head

-Increased heart rate when I stand up

-Can feel my heart beating when i sit/stand still

-Ear pressure/fullness from time to time

-Tinnitus (regular ringing in the ears) (experienced pulsatile Tinnitus last week for the 1st time)

-Heart rate increases when I walk

(Derealization, Tinnitus, hot room+bright LED lights discomfort, unexpected chest discomfort. All experienced after panic attacks and still persist)


I constantly feel like there is something wrong with my health, heart, chest, etc. I feel i may have tachycardia or something entirely different or it could just be anxiety. Please help me out!!

362,0,"Sometimes I can’t focus on text. It drives me nuts. I’m wondering if it’s to do with anxiety.

You know how, when you look at words like these ones right now, the words around them are kind of defocused or put out of your mind? That way, you can focus on the words you’re actually looking at. That’s what happens to me, but with ALL the words—including the ones I’m focused on.

It’s not like they’re blurry, and they’re not doubling. They just... don’t register. Like I can’t get my brain or eyes to actually decipher them. I’ve been to the eye doctor, who couldn’t find anything and sent me to a specialist, but I’m waiting months for the appointment.

363,0,"I am terribly afraid of insects, spiders and bugs, especially ones that sting (or that might sting), fly and especially their buzzing noises.

It is currently the middle of the night and I am on vacation in a hot country. I come from a northern climate where I do not experience many of them. The last cupple of days I have had issues sleeping because of constantly listening for and being alert when suspecting isects in my proximity.

I have been very careful as to keep my room clean of them but when I hear a buzzing sound I can't ignore it and experience flight or fight like reactions. E.g scream (varying volume), run, jump / get up or (as right now) stay alert and try to hunt them down.

Often if a sound is similar to that of an buzzing insect, it also terrifies me. What if what I hear turns out to be in my own head... (which might be the case now I'm not sure). 

This fear and how it controls my actions is tiresome and I want to find a way to overcome it. I know it won't go away in a snap but I think I need some advice or resources. Where should I even start?

364,0,"A month ago, I (20 M) started what I'd consider to be my first proper job. It's an internship where I'm working full-time for 3 months until the next Uni year begins. It's been useful for me, because I have struggled to get jobs in the past. I was so anxious about getting involved in the workplace that I would feel sick even sending off my CV. I got lucky with this because I was one of the students recommended for the position by my course leader, meaning that I didn't have to provide my (non-existent) references. For years I have had low self-esteem because I felt like I couldn't handle a job. I saw this as an opportunity to help ease my anxiety as it's had a major affect on me for the last few years.

&amp;#x200B;

The job itself has been relatively easy compared to other job roles. Our intern group has been separated from the other employees, so about 70%-80% of the time it's just us working on projects on our own. The remainder of that time, our boss comes in. He usually answers emails for an hour or 2 while giving us vague advice about projects occasionally. He's the only new person I have really had to get used to, as I already knew the other interns (we get along really well).

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that I am in a very good situation here, but I do still have problems that I am struggling with.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever the boss is around, or anyone I'm not familiar with, I struggle to think and speak properly. Anxiety hits me, which makes things difficult as my role is largely based around generating ideas. My mind goes blank, which isn't great when my boss asks questions in an overly-complicated way. I feel like I am performing worse than I would at Uni, as I find it harder to get any meaningful work done correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to get better at thinking logically in those situations because I'll be starting to work with other people in a week or so. I've met them once before and it was completely awkward. I was asked questions occasionally, but I struggled to answer because nothing came to mind. I even replied in a horrible coherent trail off sentence to one of them, who I later found out was one of the founders to the successful agency that we're working with. It was in a loud, informal environment though, so hopefully it doesn't have a huge impact on me. It's awkward anyway because we are completely different people. They're more used to the city and fast-paced environments. I'm more of a shut-in, happy in my own company kind of person. The way they were talking about where I lived as well - I didn't really appreciate. It came off as if they were looking down on the area. But I guess I'll just have to put differences aside.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling a little more confident in myself over the last month. I'm usually really quiet around my boss, but I have given a presentation once on the main task we were given. I have made some effort to say more than just the basic ""hi"" or ""how was your weekend?"" comments. I find it really difficult though. It doesn't help that I sometimes have no idea if I'm doing enough work, or if it is good enough. We don't get a lot of feedback and when we do, it's usually convoluted due to all the ""business speak"" he uses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have improved in ways, though. My anxiety was so bad during the interview phase that every time I had to meet the boss, I couldn't sleep the night before. However, when I started the job, I have managed to get a semi-healthy amount of sleep most days. I'm getting better at finding myself jobs to do as well, as I struggled at the beginning. It's just sometimes I feel unhappy because I feel like I should be better than I am now, if that makes sense?

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I have just been feeling insecure about the whole experience, but at least it is an opportunity to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone give any advice? It would be appreciated. Advice for Workplace Anxiety (Internship)?"
365,0,"It's probably a cliche thing to whine about girls, but my problem involves a crush. She's a regular at the Subway I work at. Sometimes I can talk to her well sometimes I can't, sometimes it goes well and sometimes it doesn't and that often sets my mood for the rest of the day. Lately I've been trying to just talk to her about it. I try to find an opportunity where there aren't people in ear shot and she's already paid so she can leave the conversation easily. About a week ago it all kind of lined up and I got her attention and I had hyped myself up all day about it but my heart rate skyrocketed and I froze up and couldn't do it. I'm also often looking for excuses to not do it. The biggest one being that I don't know what's appropriate to say or OK to feel considering we don't know each other outside of that. I don't know if this really counts as anxiety, but it really feels like I'm physically unable to have that conversation because I freeze up and my heart rate panics.

I have no goals, no dreams. Any talents or something to hold onto that could possibly drag me out to my future (a really weird comparison, but I hope you understand what i mean).
So I search for approval in everything. Try to get somewhere with somewhat. 

I know, that in the end nothing of it matters. But still I want to prove someone that I am worthy of living. That there's might be a chance I somehow deserve to be here.. And that someone is probably me..

This year I lifted my grades up to A's and B's. (We got a 4-10 system, so it would be 9s and 10s, and like three 8s)
This is the best I've ever gotten and I really worked hard for them. But.
But. My friend makes me feel bad about it.
As most teens we complain, after a test we say that we probably failed it.

When she says that she probably got a C/E and gets a A/B. It's no big deal. Awell, that's cool. When she says she suck at a subject and yet get a good grade it's good! Like, I'm happy for you!

But when the same happens to me. Idk why or how, but she makes me feel guilty. 
""Oh. I thought you 'sucked' at this subject""
""Oh wow we get it. You got a high score. Congrats""
""Didn't you say you would get an E on the test. Yeah suuuuure...""
Ect.

Idk I just hate this. Bc my grades prove me that what I'm doing is not in vain, that I might be worth something. But when she says it like that... I just can't help but wish I failed the test and I always feel like I need some kind of excuse to prove myself innocent.. And I just end up hating myself even more.

I know she probably means nothing bad, and since my friends don't react I'm probably overthinking it. But I really hate myself and want to just disappear every time it happens.. Friends and grades"
368,0,"I moved into an attic room 2 days ago. The AC I bought isn't doing Jack shit and it's hot as fuck during the day. All of my money is gone. I have something going on with my body that makes it hard for me to walk. Don't know what it is yet. I can't work, I can barely make it around my room let alone down the three flights of stairs, or around the block, or standing on my feet all day at work. It's been going on for at least 2 weeks and is only getting worse, not better.

I am most likely going to be homeless in a month, and the sweltering heat of this attic is already  making me want to end it. 

I know some of this is due to my own decisions. But I had this move planned before I started to get sick and I was going to start working as soon as I got up here. Now I don't know what to do with myself. I'm incredibly overwhelmed right now and I don't have anyone to talk to"

Always saying I need to wear maternity clothes and what not and saying she wants to give me a make over (I'm a pregnant transman. And she knows this. And proceeded to ignore ignore this fact since me and my partner have been together) 
  I feel like she doesnt like me. I already know she doesnt like me. She doesnt talk to me at all and when she does it's barely a whole full sentence.  And I feel like when I join in on a joke she just goes silent and ignores me. Shes constantly doing passove aggressive sighs if it gets too quiet. 

 I know she doesnt like me because before she even met me my partner was with me and she tried to pick them up without warning and I had to get someone to give them a ride to the campus to get their stuff. All of a sudden she gets mad and calls and leaves a voice mail on our way there saying ""that's fine stay with that fat heffer. You're not welcome here anymore""

389,0,"I had to take a night job(I have two kids and a husband ) working 8pm-230am. The past week I have been having break through anxiety through my medication. 

Over time I have figured out my anxiety triggers. Lack of sleep, too much caffeine, stress and health anxiety are mine.  Well, working nights and up in the mornings with kids, you sure get exhausted fast. 
I would hate when people would say “give into your anxiety” “ride it out” blah blah. I would tell myself “yeah OK. That doesn’t work” and just continue to freak out, panic and thinking I’m about to die. Because that is obviously better than listening to advice.

Last night, we were slammed at work. I waitress and I had to run back and fourth between about 30 customers and two bottle service tables. Dark lighting, strobe lights, the worst environment for anxiety. While serving one of the tables I could see an ocular migraine starting. (Seeing lights in my vision) 
Usually, I would panic. Freak out. Thinking I was about to have a stroke or a seizure. But I have into my anxiety. I knew I have had this happen before to me and I didn’t die. So I told myself mentally, I wouldn’t die this time. I took a moment to myself in the bathroom and gave into it. I took “ujjayi breathes” which I had learned a few days prior. It means ocean breathing. I suggest googling on how to do it! It’s a life changer. Told myself, “you know what this is. Don’t let it go any further. It’s anxiety. You’re tired, you’re stressed. Don’t let it trigger you to more.” As I calmed my breathing, spoke to myself, the lights in my vision slowly went away. My HR slowly started going back to normal. My body and mind relaxed. I felt calm. And it was over. I rode out my anxiety/panic attack. I felt victorious. I finally felt like I won and I could over come my anxiety. 

I don’t know if anyone will read this or take anything away from it. But I’ve been suffering with anxiety for 16 years and I finally feel like I made a break through on it. Also, I have been listening to a podcast called “the anxiety coaches” and listening to it before work and when I want to calm and relax my body sure has been helping!

Hope this helps ❤️ I’ve found a way to help my anxiety and it’s the way I didn’t think would ever work."

People always tell me I just need to do it already but how? I ""know how"". Talk to my doctor, find a therapist. But idk how to overcome some of these feelings and actually do these things for myself. I know how ridiculous this sounds but anxiety usually doesn't make sense.

398,0,"So I am dealing with something extremely scary. A couple of weeks ago, I thought for a good week that I am going blind. I since then went to 4 ophthalmologists that reassured me that my eyes are fine. Context: I stood up after a lash lift with a huge migraine and was seeing blurry for a good 15 mins. The panic I felt in the moment is beyond imagination. That same night, although I could see clearly I noticed that the fluorescent lights were SUPER bright. They still are at night. Since that moment, I convinced myself I was going blind. The stress was intense. I also started noticing some transparent floaters that would ""glow"" in front of bright lights. I even went to the ER because my vision just didn't ""feel the same"". They did a CT. Nothing. Now waiting for a neurologist.

But since that hellish week, I have been experiencing other symptoms. I look around me and it's like I feel dizzy. It's like I hear muffled but my hearing is fine. It's like I can see although I clearly can. I experience shortness of breath often and even at night, I can't fall asleep because of this. I don't feel hunger or fatigue or any emotions. I feel trapped and like a complete robot. I try to stay positive, eat healthily, tell myself that it will pass like the rest of my loved ones say. But my brain always comes back to the thought that there's something physically wrong with me. and altough I don't feel the anxiety, I bet it's eating me alive as we are speaking. Doctors telling me everything is fine is not reassuring. Am I experiencing derealization? I am suddenly so aware of my internal being and yet so far from everything in front of me. 

How can I break free??? HELP Post health anxiety derealization?"

Whenever I have a really bad day with anxiety, I have a lot of disassociation and brain fog. I’ll be in the middle of doing something and it’s like I just blank. Literally. Like my mind leaves my body and I die for a second until I snap out of it. For example, I’m a barista and I was making drinks the other day and I felt pretty anxious in general and i was in the middle of steaming some milk, and I randomly blanked and when I came back to, the 152• milk was all over my apron, shoes, and floor.

400,0,"My boyfriend and I have been using condoms but obviously a less breakable method of birth control is safer. I recently got insurance but it doesn't cover Planned Parenthood so I have to make an appointment with a doctor and go in and do that whole waste of time thing. First of all the doctor isn't even available to CALL me for 10 days. I'm fairly healthy and don't want an exam/pap smear/general check up/pregnancy test....etc. I asked about getting birth control without all that and was told it ""depends on the practitioner"" so it's not even necessary or required by law for safety it's just more people controlling women that I have to pay for? ?? I'm very stressed and nervous, I don't want the massive invasion of privacy. I want to get an implant so I can have safe sex. Obviously I will do everything to needed to make sure using birth control is safe but if someone poking around in my vagina was required to make sure I could use birth control it wouldn't be up the practitioner. I'm really worried I won't be able to get birth control without either paying tons of money at an out-of-network Planned Parenthood or risking using just condoms to avoid the humiliation of not having control over my own fucking body. 

Women who have gotten the arm implant....where did you go? Did you have to do a bunch of unnecessary stuff? What questions were you asked? If you didn't have insurance, how much was it? I'm poor af college student with no steady income but my Dad makes enough that I don't qualify for low cost options. I'm obviously not going to ask him for $800+ for birth control.

Something that really bothered me is that about a month ago, maybe a little shorter, I had a massive breakdown because I was triggered by something said by someone I care about, my SO's mom. I was talking with my SO and his dad about it, and I said something about mental illness and his dad went, ""but you don't have a mental illness.""  
  
I don't recall what I said at the time, but I just...I feel like I do. People have accused me before of ""trying to find something wrong"" with myself, but I swear I'm not.

407,0,"I’ve been a manager at a fortune 5 company for 3 years now. I started out right out of college at 22 and now I’m 25. When I first began working there I discovered that I had work place anxiety. I never experienced this in college or before. I doubted all of my decisions in the fear of being wrong, or simply not knowing what to do. This then lead to slower productivity, more anxiety, the cycle goes on. Despite it being present I always was able to somehow get out of it through good attitude, and just working through it. My jobs were primarily operations or operations support related. I always thrived on projects and it was a definite skill to my employers. Fast forward to this March. I got a promotion to a project manager role. On paper this job was my dream role. Not worried about the craziness of operations, focusing on projects 100% of the time, and having company wide impact. Within the first week, I immediately began to see red flags. I began getting overloaded with deadlines as I was still learning the ins and outs of the business. The schedule was a typical “corporate” M-F schedule, but everyone was working 6-7 days a week to stay afloat. I was used to working an operations schedule which was four days a week 10-11 hours a day. I know the long days sound rough but that extra day was great to rest. Ambitious as hell,  I wasn’t so worried about the workload I saw in front of me. I was confident, and happy about the new job. As I began doing this i really started to see the impact it was beginning to have in my life. I’d rush to work in the morning, come home late, and spend most of the weekend working or worrying about work.  I also started experiencing many extreme uphill battles with projects, as stuff was starting to get assigned to me that I had no interest in doing. My personal life was completely evaporated and consumed with work. This began to give me anxiety which of course made me less and less efficient. It’s gotten to a point where I’ve been unable to complete big deliverables because I have so much anxiety about them. They are then late or incomplete which throws me into crazy panic attacks. I’m 3 months in and I’m pretty sure I’ve ruined my reputation. It’s gotten to the point where Ive had to leave work at times because I was having such a bad panic attacks. It all came to a point last night. I had 2 meetings scheduled for today that were critical for the year. I couldn’t prepare for them over the weekend like I was supposed to due to anxiety. Late last night I had a panic attack so bad that I went to a walk in clinic for meds. I never in a million years would think I need medicine for anxiety. I am also out for the whole week using time to recover. They haven’t given me any trouble over it but it’s at a horrible time to be taking off. I’m in disbelief that it has come to this. I feel like I’m making horrible decisions taking more time off and starting medicine to cope. I want to take this head on and fix the issues at work or find a new job but I can’t bring myself to it. Any insight on my story and what I should would be greatly appreciated. How did it get this bad"

my dad has a long history of anxiety and i never knew what it felt like and honestly i never had any symptoms of it until a few months ago but i still thought i was just being nervous about something. recently tho i finally realized that i do indeed have anxiety and it really sucks. my brain doesn’t like change and i like to stick to a routine or schedule so when i have to do things that i’m not used to, for example i’m on vacation right now, i feel nauseous and anxious for no reason and i know it’s so stupid but it seems to be happening all the time now. i also would consider myself not very good at social situations, i never have been but i’m not sure if that has anything to do with my anxiety, probably though. i’m the type of person that would rather be at home talking to no one than go out and talk to a bunch of people. i don’t get bored easily and i can usually entertain myself pretty well.

anyways, i was just wondering what i should do about this. i don’t know if there are any medications that can help me but i just am so scared that things are going to get worse and i don’t wanna limit myself in the future. i have never talked to a doctor about this or really anyone besides my parents.

my dad has also told me that it’s just my brain talking to itself and when i get anxiety to just say it’s okay and go talk to people and not just sit in my room all day and close myself out.

426,0,"I (22F) met a classmate (22M) who had the same interests (games, puzzles and movies) as me two years ago. We became best friends and I eventually told him I may have a crush on him. We dated for a short 2 months before he told me that he couldn't see a future with me because of my personality and my issues. He suggested being FWB only and I agreed, simply because I still liked him and I was afraid of letting him go. At the end of last year he wanted to stop any contact, I had gotten too attached, and I became a burden. 

I tried to salvage our friendship but he said I never gave him the space he wanted, he'd be happier never talking to me ever again. That was 6 months ago. 

I've come to terms with the fact that it was entirely my fault for creating this situation, I was the one who agreed to the FWB, the one with severe anxiety and personal issues and the one who became too much for him to handle. My only problem right now is that I continue to experience severe nausea and occasionally vomit whenever I see him. Even though I try my best avoiding places where I know he usually goes, we still take the same course and have classes together. I'm tired of the nausea and vomiting every week. It's already been so long, why am I still getting nauseous at the sight of him, I thought I've moved on, I haven't spoken to him for 6 months...

430,0,"Hey everyone. The past few months have been pretty rough and I would just like to get everything off my chest. So basically, I'm a 15 year old male who had his first panic attack 3 months ago, in April. What happened was that I was on spring break, and was just hanging out at home. At about 10 PM, I drank a few cups of coffee (I usually never drink coffee) because I was planning on staying up and watching movies, playing games. At the same time, I was also trying to dye my hair with this natural plant called henna (it gives a reddish color), which I had done many times before. In order to apply it, you have to mix the powder with water until it becomes mud-like, which you then apply to your hair. I stayed up until 4 AM thanks to the coffee, and the mixture on my head was getting pretty heavy so I hit the shower to wash it off. When I got out, I felt a little strange but I just brushed it off. The sun was starting to rise and I was feeling tired so I went to sleep. I woke up about an hour later feeling sick and my heartbeat felt strange, again I just tried to sleep again. A few hours pass and I wake up, I feel really strange. I start walking down the stairs when I suddenly feel unable to breathe. I was indeed breathing, but it felt like no air was getting in my lungs. I immediately start screaming and yelling which surprises my mother who quickly comes over. My hands feel cold and numb, I'm shaking like crazy. My heart is beating at the speed of light.  I go to lie down, I feel like I'm dying. I keep telling myself that this is it, this is the end. It feels like an eternity, when in reality it was probably just 10 minutes. My dad rushes me to a clinic, but on the way the symptoms subside. Once I get there, the panic attack has mostly passed except for the intense feeling of fear. A nurse did a few tests that I'm not sure of, they told me all my vitals were healthy. I believed they performed an ECG as well and nothing came up.

I was discharged soon after and got a blood test done. Everything came back normal except for ferritin, which was quite low. I was prescribed iron supplements and magnesium to calm down. In the weeks after, I would have episodes where I felt my heart beat faster and feel generally unwell. Some were so bad that I would end up crying to go the hospital, but in the end it would always pass. Now, wherever I go, I'm always worrying about having a heart attack or not being able to breathe. I'm scared sometimes to even leave the house.

One thing that has always persisted is a constant hunger for air, I'm constantly sighing and yawning trying to get a gulp of air and I feel a certain tightness in my chest. When I mentioned this to the doctor, he immediately dismissed it as anxiety. Right now , as I type this, I'm feeling this tightness and hunger for air. I'm tired of feeling like this all the time. Recently, I ve started to get pain in random spots in my chest and abdomen, and I'm sure it's also the anxiety.

Also, I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with a very fast heartbeat and completely covered in sweat. Basically, I just want confirmation that these are indeed symptoms of anxiety/panic disorder because I'm tired of feeling like I'm going to die all the time. Thanks. Feeling constant hunger for air, panic attacks"
431,0,"Almost every night around 6 or 7 until I fall asleep, I develop chest pains and discomfort. Sometimes it is a crushing pain, sometimes it is dull. Sometimes it doesn't even hurt, it just feels like there is something in my chest and it gets harder to breathe. I've been diagnosed with GAD, but it doesn't feel like anxiety. I have no thoughts of anxiety prior to the discomfort. The only anxiety comes from the pain. Also, even if it relax or deep breathe, it stays until I sleep. In the mornings, I usually feel fine. It's getting to the point that I can no longer stand it, its beginning to overwhelm me. Is it possible that this is still anxiety or is it GERD or a heart issue?

I've generally been a decent student throughout med school, studious, decent scores, never cheated, got through viva-voces quite without any hiccups. But the only thing that has bothered me the most was speaking out in public!
I've always been thoroughly terrified to give speeches/presentations in med school (but somehow managed it), but no matter how many times I try to overcome my stage fright and the anxiety, it just doesn't happen! I have sleepless nights weeks before my actual class presentation thinking of how I will be performing and how the audience is going to react. It's petrifying when I go out on the stage and my hands start trembling and I mess up the words and my mind completely  blanks out sometimes. I feel like I know very little about the topic and assume that the mediator will eventually laugh at my presentation.

Now that I have completed medicine, this huge question mark stands ahead of me. I am sure I'll be okay with the patients and the interaction with them.

437,0,"Hi everyone,

I haven't posted here before, but I could use a little advice or just encouragement after something that happened to me last night.

My boyfriend and I went to bed around 10pm and at 11:30pm our building's fire alarm went off. It is SO loud, maybe one of the loudest alarms I have ever heard. I don't to extremely well with loud noises, especially if they are unexpected.

I woke up screaming (not shrieking or anything, more like a loud ""ahhh"") and my boyfriend wanted to calm me, so he kind of slid on top of me and said ""the fire alarm is going off, we need to get out of the building"" as I kept screaming. At the time, I actually didn't realize I was screaming, which is why I was so alarmed that my boyfriend jumped on top of me and told me what was going on - because, yeah if you hear the fire alarm go off, that is what you do. I told my boyfriend later I was confused why he reacted that way and he told me he was trying to calm me because I was screaming.

Anyway, he helped me get out of bed and put a robe on. In less than 30 seconds we were outside and away from the building. We figured since we couldn't see or smell any smoke or fire, it was probably just set off by someone burning food or something. We stood outside for 10-15 minutes, and were able to go back inside.

I had a lot of trouble falling asleep last night. I'm usually a good sleeper, unless I am feeling anxious, then my brain tends to either want me to deeply analyze something random (for example: listing everything we have in the fridge over and over) or repeating the same thoughts over and over. Today, I have been shaking all morning and feeling extremely uneasy.

As someone who has suffered from anxiety much of my life, I know it can often be illogical, but still I feel silly being so shaken up from a simple fire alarm. I think it was just the first 10 seconds of being awoken suddenly by the alarm, my own screaming reaction, and my boyfriend's reaction to my screaming. It was a very unexpectedly traumatic and I don't know what to do about it right at this moment.

Has anyone experienced something like this?

Also, I want to note that I do see a therapist and will speak to them about this at my next appointment. And I am not currently taking any medication, but I do have some medication I was previously prescribed - Buspirone... though it has never really reduced my anxiety noticeably.

I’m 19 now and it’s persisting alright. 

Although I’ve also been a little nervous to be tested because if it wasn’t arthritis that meant I was crazy and it was my anxiety manifesting as physical pain.. but I got the courage and did it.

I called to ask about the results and one of the nurses told me I had osteoarthritis in my left hand, which is my less dominant hand so I assumed it was in both cause that’s how arthritis works, it likes to be symmetrical in your body usually although since I write (everything i do involves my hands, painting, writing, art) i understood my right hand would be noticeably worse and maybe that’s why they didn’t mention it at first. Although it’s a big deal for me to have this, it will affect my entire life because of how much I rely on being able to write. 

So I got the call from my doctor back and he said that I do not have any arthritis in either of my hands... wtf

So I’ve been kinda sitting on this panicking about the idea that my anxiety holds me back this much and there’s nothing I can do about it but slowly the pains been getting worse and worse and worse. I’ve been trying to exercise it out but over the last couple months my knees are also starting to hurt but not nearly as bad as my hands.

I haven’t been able to sleep in three weeks, I’ve literally become nocturnal. I have no idea what to do. 

(And Im not going to be able to receive therapy until next year cause I’m moving to college)

TLDR; my doctors told me I had arthritis and then changed their minds, now I’m worried the pain is cause of my anxiety what do.

But yeah should I go get another opinion? Could it be my anxiety, (I mean it feels like my bones are grinding against each other)? Or could it be something completely different and if so how do I ask a doctor about that? Should I go to another doctor?"

I’ve been on this dose for a month, before that I was on 100mg of citalopram (stopped due to side effects). My doctor advised to wean off slowly so I’m starting with 50mg just one day this week, then moving towards maybe two days a week etc. Anyone have experience of side effects or advice to offer? Thanks Weaning off slowly"

450,0,"So I have a summer job at a breakfast buffet. But I just feel like I won't make it tomorrow.
The job itself is already physically craving and today I was the only one at duty.
I am also to mention a newbie, this is my first job ever and I have worked for only one and a half week. I am fifteen.

So, the job is very tiring. A lot of running, carrying heavy stuff ect. A day is usually 4,5-5 hours. I worked overtime and finished in 6. Do as I mentioned, I am 15, a short female who never works out and hates sports. What I mean, I'm not very strong. Nor mentally or physically.

Already when I come home after 5 hours I am exhausted. Now I was drenched in sweat, my legs were giving in and I went straight to bed after a cold shower. Nothing new. I always do this. Wake up at 6 am, come home by 1 pm, go to bed, don't leave the bed till sleep time, wake up, repeat. 
If I don't work, I don't leave my bed at all.

Today was my first day of work completely on my own. I had already prior discussed with my employer about ending the contract earlier bc I didn't think I would be able to make it. But things kinda sorted themselves out and I am now continuing. 
 
Right, to the point. I wanted to call in sick tomorrow, probably telling I had a fever when I came home. I have really bad menstrual cramps, which is true but I don't feel comfortable having that and me being tired as an excuse. Which already made today a lot harder. But I don't want to cause problems for the others. 
The ones who will be called in is either a guy who has till now been working 6/7 days in the week and finally got like 4 days off. Or someone i don't know, so it will probably be him.
(But next week we work Wednesday together, he has again only one day off so I can ask him to take one of his shifts)
And tomorrow is the last day of a girl (at least for me working with her) who I has been working with and I really don't want to cause her problems since she's really nice.

But I really don't want to go to work tomorrow, I feel so selfish for being like this. Call in sick"

Or if there’s a rumour going around and people don’t want to be associated with you anymore? And then just thinking about every single thing that may have made them not want to be with you? And then you just want to cry and stay there in your bed curled up because the sadness you’re feeling causes physical pain? Because that happens to me often and it just ruins my day. I just realize how people forget about me easily when this thing happens. Then I question everything and everyone and start to think twice about everything. I start to think about everything I may have done to those people for them to not want to spend time with me. I feel like a looser just expressing how I feel but I needed to tell someone. I just hate how everyone has real friends and I feel like I’m the only one with fake friends. It just happened to me and now I just don’t feel like doing anything. It scrapped my day...

458,0,"Hello everyone. 
I recently got my first job for the summer and I’m afraid it’s been making me feel a lot worse. I’ve been experiencing anxiety before a shift and a night before work but leads me to stress and cry. 
Besides that, I’ve always been a person who cries. I am pretty emotional and super sensitive. It probably started in 7th grade, when I would get really sad and i didn’t know why. I didn’t know what to do so i started harming myself. Once my mom found it, she got mad and made me stop but she never consoled me or asked me what made me do that. In high school, it would continue. I would get stressed and sad for really minimal things. In college, it also occurred and I didn’t know what to do about it. I don’t really talk about it with anyone besides my boyfriend and a couple of friends but I always try to hold back because I don’t want to trouble anyone with my issues or annoy them because this is an issue I’ve been constantly facing. 
About a week or two ago, I got my first panic attack which lead me to miss work. My mom and brother saw it happen, but again my mom got really mad at me and asked why i haven’t told her anything that’s been going on and then proceeded to yell at me saying that i don’t want to be apart of the family and I’m always so closed off. I don’t feel comfortable telling my parents because i feel like their only response will to get mad at me. 
Once i go back to college, my plan is to talk to someone at my student health center because i don’t know what to do. I can’t stop crying"

The weather here in the uk is beautiful currently, me being me was, like better wear flip flops (my anxiety level gets so bad I worry that if I wear trainers in summer people
Are judging me for not dressing correctly) anyway I crack out the “expected” feminine foot wear, even though they make my feet ache and the slip hurts the gap between my toe(I’m sure you guys understand AND they are so so loud and announce my presence before I arrive with the flap flap slip slap noise) eeuurrgghh sorry yeah flip flops ANYWAY... I leave the house, earphones in..check.. and off we go. 
30 seconds away from my house is a weird cheap garage that’s a gym for hard people and 2 car garages and i walk past these places every day, it’s ok they don’t pay me much attention but I’m very aware when the gym door is open (it’s a sliding garage door type thing) so all the people in can see the whole road whilst pumping iron, and when all the mechanics stand around smoking (they gather in little gangs outside).. I’m walking along and yes gym open and mechanics smoking. A double buggy is coming towards me so I step down onto the road off the pavement to let it past and as I go to step back up onto the curb, my flip flop catches the curb and I fall sideways onto the pavement and into the hedge that runs along the other side......................................................
It happened slowly and I knew they”the men folk” had all seen. 3 rushed over to help the gym stopped clanking as they all had a good watch at the drama happening. My ankle hurt like crazy my knee was grazed by pride was taken straight to the morgue.(it was dead before I hit the ground) now id like to add how lovely they all were to me and even offered to walk me home, I’m insisted I was honestly ok but was gonna head home and check,I hid the limp and thanked them and went home. The burning in my cheeks was cooled by the tears that came after I’d turned around to walk back home. Barb wire throat choke and shaking hands.. I wish I was normal, I wish I didn’t care so much. Have taken to walking a longer route to the shops now as can’t pass That garage again not yet anyway... sigh! So yeah I must have looked a right weirdo, don’t get me wrong I was so polite and thankful they came to help but now added worry they think I’m weird.. well I am but not drink hedge falling weird.

466,0,"I started taking Zoloft in January because of depression stuff, and just being generally unhappy and scared all the time.  Anyways, I’ve struggled with derealisation every single day since August 2018.  No idea what caused it, but I can’t pay attention, and it’s been hard to figure out what’s real, and what’s not.

Back to the question at hand.  I was given 100 mg of Zoloft to take each day, and it has definitely helped my mood in the best way possible.  I haven’t been suicidal, there’s no random breakdowns with crying, all that’s pretty good.
However, the dissociation hasn’t changed, and I’d wager to say it’s even worse some days than it had been before.  It always feels like I’m watching my life play out on a tv screen from a couch in my head, where reality doesn’t quite seem to match what I imagine it to be.  I’ve also been just soooo tired.  Like I’m fine in the morning, but by the early afternoon it feels like I’ve been awake for days.  I mean I have never slept well, but I’m way more tired than normal.

Anyways, about a week ago I missed a dose of Zoloft.  I woke up the next morning, and I felt like my head was a little clearer.  I haven’t taken a dose since, and I think some of the dissociation has calmed down a bit.  It’s for sure still there, but at least I can kind of figure out where I am in real life, instead of thinking I’m stuck somewhere in a dream in my mind. Anyone else get worsening dissociation with Zoloft?"

468,0,"I’ve got the most amazing boyfriend, and good friends too. 

But sometimes I get anxiety out of nowhere and deep down, I know how illogical it is, and I hate it.... but I still have it.

For example, tonight my boyfriend went to a party. It was a sudden invite, and he didn’t invite me along. Whatever, right? I trust him totally and I know he loves me. Although I was a little disappointed (I’ve never been to a party, or seen my boyfriend drunk, both of which I want to do), I understood he just needed time with his friends. 

But my anxiety... I’m freaking out worrying if he’s cheating, how’s he going to get home, is he okay... etc. Even THOUGH I KNOW HOW ILLOGICAL IT IS.

I hate it.

And then I tried to ask my friend if it was fair to be a little annoyed at him for disappearing without telling me his plans to get home... and she was like “just let him be an adult.”

I just wanted to be understood... I haven’t texted him at all because deep down, I’m totally fine with the party, I know he’s not stupid and that everything will be fine. But right now my anxiety is through the roof. 

I feel like only you guys would understand; anxiety isn’t something that can easily be controlled, and I wish I didn’t feel like this, but I do.... and I can’t talk to anyone about it, because of how unjustified it is, and I don’t want to make it sound like I don’t trust my boyfriend.

Right now I’m trying to have a warm bath and calm down, but it’s not really working. :/

Also, the last time my ex boyfriend went to a party, I got cheated on... so this is potentially a bit of a trigger for me. I feel like you guys are the only ones who would understand how I feel."

470,0,"I’m currently off of university for the summer and moving back into a shared around the beginning of August. I’ve managed to find a beautiful woman to call my girlfriend and a strong support network of friends over my tenure at university, but alas; with my first year over and the return of everyone home I find myself alone.

Now I’m not truly and physically alone and I know that, if anything I probably have more family than most here. Two grandparents, a Caribbean grandfather and a British grandmother. I live with my uncle and my mother. I’m not to up on how trigger warnings work as I’ve basically shut down my understanding of anxiety over the past year. But yeah, possibly major trigger warning. I’m sorry, it just helps to bear my soul to at least someone.

So around my birth, my father cheated on my mother and this caused her post maternal depression to go into overdrive. My dads a bit of a c*** and I mean that in every sense of the word. He’s a womaniser, always but his girlfriends first and let one of them slap me at age 2. He fought my mum while she was pregnant. Anyway, I started seeing him twice a week when that broke down and my mother retreated into herself (naturally, I don’t hate her for this although I do believe it feeds into my issues). Began to be raised by nan. Who was also depressed because her father, my great grandfather died around my birth. I was raised in a cold household with a lot of people who were emotionally closed off and never really got over their issues.

I was also born with two deformities, a large skin tag just next to my ear and hypospdias, which I really don’t want to explain right now but you’ll be able to find it easily enough. So I feel like I may have had the world against me. Oh, and we were and still are super poor. Last year my first relationship broke down and my then long distance girlfriend left me for someone who had physically abused her in the past. She also had to juggle adopting her sister and niece and dropping out of college. Bullied relentlessly blah blah you guys have been there.

I got on an up when I got to university. I had my first kiss, lost my virginity, moved to halls and loved it and got an amazing girlfriend. Got very drunk, smoked a lot. You know the deal. I didn’t want to leave it behind. Struggles from a child only just began to make sense. I finally realised why I felt the way I did. Until my cousin on my dads side phoned me at 1am while I was at my girlfriends house with her parents telling me how my half sibling are 8 and 4 (I’m 18) and that I should reconnect with my father, because his mother (my auntie in law) had died, his step father abandoned him and he moved in with his dad, my uncle and my dads brother who had previously threatened to rape and kill his own son and his ex wife. 

Pretty much since then I feel like my mental health has tanked. I think my girlfriend is cheating on me constantly when I know she isn’t, I can’t trust anyone, I don’t know how to cope with being alone anymore and I’ve cried for hours on end everyday for 6 of them now. And I still have a month left until I’m in my shared house with girlfriend and friends. 

Coming to terms with this stuff alone has been tough. Real tough. Thus, I come to you internet. I’m not sure if these types of posts gain much traction but I’d appreciate a friend or even a conversation at this point as everyone around me is just as traumatised as I am (low income areas and all that) and can’t really communicate their feelings well. Thank you for making it this far if you did. I hope maybe my story will perhaps ease some anxiety the rest of you are going through. Thank you guys!!

It's like my way of dealing with things is by detaching myself from my surroundings and I enter a sort of dreamy swaying mental state and my only focus is finding somewhere away from the source. My vision goes tunnel and fuzzy and my eyes glaze over, I don't really freeze I just switch off and everything I hear sounds far away, If I have headphones on I put it on full blast but can't focus on the lyrics.  

In a way I'm kind of grateful this is how my brain works because I can't imagine ever being openly dramatic and physically anxious like a lot of people I know are, but to each are their own. Do you process anxiety by ""spacing out"" or detaching completely?"

Of course because these thoughts are intrusive and I don't want to think about them it makes it really difficult to take my mind off of them. I'm really anxious about it because I fear that I'm slipping into some sort of psychotic episode or  that if I think hard enough about these things I'm going to lose touch with reality.

BUT let’s backtrack a little. A few weeks ago I started Adderall XR slow release to help with my racing thoughts. Before I was on 15mg then upped it to 20mg. Keep in mind, I am a 5’8 skinny white dude. I was spacing the medicine out every other day but two weeks ago I decided to take it back to back. Ever sense then, I’ve had crippling anxiety attacks. Making stuff up that isn’t even there, having to leave work early due to just not being there mentally and so on (Side note: I talked to my doctor about lowering the dosage and all. But to be honest, scares the shit out of me to even touch it) 

My girlfriend, we’ll call her Amelia. Amelia and I have been dating for about a month and a half and everything is going swimmingly well. But once these anxiety attacks started happening I started creating these nonexistent issues that weren’t even there. I started obsessing over things that didn’t need to be obsessed over. Amelia went to hang out with her coworker, we’ll call him George. George was showing Amelia a good time with his friends. Which is fine don’t get me wrong, but my mind took it to a place where it didn’t need to. Drove me nuts. Blew her phone up because I just needed to know what was happening. We talked it out and everything is cool now but ever sense that first really bad anxiety attack, they keep happening. I’m not sure if it’s side effects from the medication or me coming down from it or a combination of both or I’m just crazy. Typically driving at night helps and listening to music. I’ll call Amelia and we’ll talk it out but I just feel like I’m burdening her and I don’t want to do that. I’ve had anxiety before but NEVER this bad. These typically happen at night but sometimes during the day and it’s really random stuff that sets it off. I’m usually the “happy-go-lucky” guy but underneath the surface I can be a real hot mess. Amelia understands where I’m coming from and she’s incredibly patient with me and helps me work through it but I don’t want to burden her every time I’m having a bad night. Because lately, it’s been happening more and more. I hope these stop soon. Has anyone else gone through something similar?

My anxiety has been insane lately and I’ve developed a fear of being alone. So I’ve been going out even if I don’t want to and doing whatever people I’m around want to do. It’s just been a distraction I guess, but I mostly still feel unhappy. 

Tonight I went to a party with my bf, and it was all people he knows. No one socialized with me, even when I tried to spark up a conversation. The bf quickly got drunk and started being all buddy buddy with everyone and getting belligerent, leaving me completely to my own devices. Which I wouldn’t have even noticed if I had anyone else there to talk to. I even tried to walk over and be a part of other groups but everyone including my bf ignored me. Not to mention, I feel like lately I’ve been babysitting every time we go out and it makes it not fun for me at all. I’m dragging everyone home at 2am while they can hardly stand and I’m the person that gets them into their apartments when they can’t even find their keys. 

It’s getting exhausting and of course I want my friends to have fun and I want to make sure they get home safely, but why am I always the thing between them stumbling around in an alley and being safe in their bed. 

Anyway... tonight I left. I knew I was going home to be alone. I knew I’d have to leave my bf there knowing he wouldn’t text me and would probably have to wander home in the middle of the night and get lost (this has actually happened)...and I feel good! I went for a little drive and listened to Simple Plan and Green Day as the sun was setting over the city. It was such a relief, and I’m glad I had the courage to do it.  It feels like I did something for me, and it’s liberating knowing I can be alone and not have a panic attack. It actually feels quite nice. Feeling proud of myself"

482,0,"I'm trying to get some things started in life and sometimes people say to me that I have plenty of time, take it easy, no need to feel pressured, etc.

I don't know why, but it just makes everything seem so much worse. Maybe it's because hearing ""no pressure"" makes me think about all the pressure I put on myself, and how I shouldn't be putting pressure on myself. And that thought is even more unnerving, and it just spirals. Idk, just a weird observation about my brain, I guess. Does anyone else feel insanely pressured whenever someone says ""No pressure""?"

484,0,"Throwaway account because my other one is for business and my other other one is tied to who I am.

Context: I’m a MTF transgender gal still living with my parents (I’m a student and run my own online business part time), I’ve been on hormones for just over a year now but I still don’t present female frequently. I’ve struggled with severe anxiety all my life and have been in counseling for it somewhere around ~10 years now - it’s better now, but I still get really bad social anxiety when shopping (I’m often checked/followed by loss prevention and security since I’m visibly anxious).

With that over with, let’s begin the story:

I’ve been cooped up in my house all week and decided to head to the local mall to get out for a bit. My morning was already pretty filled with anxiety (got woken up by being yelled at, fun...), so I was already kinda shaky and on edge. I get to the mall, I walk around, I sit at a coffee shop and check my phone. I search through my texts with my ex-girlfriend/close friend and realized that the other night, we were talking about sex toys at 3am. She struggles with anxiety on par with mine, so neither of us had bought any in person or even ordered online.

Something just came (hah, *came*, get it?) over me and made me wanna take that anxiety head on and show it to myself that not only can I go shopping and survive checking out and people trying to assist me, I can buy the most embarrassing thing I want - a little pocket vibrator from Spencer’s - and be just fine. With that, I set out on a mission.

After a failed attempt (I ended up buying a pride bumper magnet - not complaining), I came back to the store, grabbed the pocket vibrator and plopped it down on the counter. The cashier couldn’t care less, I survived, and I walked out with a vibrator!

It’s silly and it’s not that big of an achievement (I think), but god damnit that little thing is my trophy for telling my anxiety to fuck off today, and I couldn’t be prouder.

Sorry for the ramble, I just needed to share this!! I finally treated myself! (NSFW)"

I had a tremendous fear of crowds and being in them made me panicked and would trigger my touretts tics like crazy. I lived in Las Vegas at the time where the grocery stores were open 24/7 so I did all my grocery shopping at midnight and it seemed like a solution at the time. I eventually got a job with insurance and started medication and therapy for my numerous issues. Today my spouse and I went clothes shopping at a huge mall on a Sunday. It wasn't until we got home that I realized what I had just done without even noticing it. I was out among the crowds and I didn't get anxious or nervous and had no tics or anything. I know it can be slow going but therapy, meditation and medication really do work. I have also found practicing stoicism has helped me tremendously. Improvement"
490,0,"A little background: I have generalized anxiety, morbid OCD, PTSD, Social phobia and depression. Possible ADHD and autism. My biggest anxiety fear is loss of control courtesy of the morbid OCD line of thinking.

I've been on Busperione for nearly a month. By the 3rd it will have been so. I started with 10 mg twice a day for a week, now up to 3 times a day so 30mg in total per day. I have all the lovely side effects, but the worst of all was that it's made my anxiety and panic feelings a lot worse, like I have a constant almost unyeilding nervous energy 22/5 which is far worse at night. It's very frustrating, not only because from what I read, Busperione usually has the least bad side effects (I'm unlucky and getting some of the more uncommon ones, like gastral upset, brain zaps, muscle spasms, confusion etc) but to have anxiety increase into a barely staved off panic attacks at least once a day really freaking sucks. I'm also working on a lot of exposure therapy and CBT and that's definitely poked a already very mad very scared bear.I read that this can happen and for many it was like a switch at some point in the month to six week mark that their anxiety when markedly down and they were doing much better. But right now, I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I won't quit, but I'm more angry, sad and scared than I've been in a long time. I hope you guys can share some insight on your experiences, especially those with very similar symptoms and mental disorder flavors like mine.

I also recently read that you need to either eat, or not eat while taking the meds and stick to it. Unfortunately I switched this up because I noticed I felt much worse if I don't eat at the time of dosage. I really hope that I haven't ""reset"" my bodies process of getting used to it by starting to eat when I take my dosage.

Anyway, hope you guys are having a good day. Anxiety absolutely sucks like nothing I've known before. Anyone taking or has taken busperione? This drug is kicking my ass :/"

495,0,"Has anyone else felt so empathetic towards TV characters that it causes panic attacks? I have trouble watching any TV shows that are actually filmed in real life. I worry so much about the characters and what’s going to happen that it feels like my entire chest is being squeezed and I get my normal anxiety attack symptoms that will last for a while afterwords. It really sucks because I enjoy watching shows, but if it’s something I’ve never watched I get really scared and upset. And even if it’s something I have already watched I get paranoid something will change. I really want to relax and unwind, but I have to limit myself to cartoons and anime so I don’t get to attached and have this reaction. 

I also feel horrible afterwords I get into a state of disassociation, and it’s hard to cope with the fact that whatever happened in the show wasn’t real. I feel like I went through whatever the characters went through, and it can even effect my feelings towards my relationship. If the characters in the show are having relationship troubles I also feel like I’m going through the same thing, even though I have a very happy stable relationship.

This also can happen when I read books as well, but I actually stopped reading years ago because this problem got so bad. Because it’s even worse when I’m reading.

496,0,"So lately I've been having a hard time. I got divorced earlier this year and have been struggling with loneliness. I don't consider people to be friends anymore, just associates. No one acts in a way I could consider a friend to do. I never get texts from anyone. The only interaction I have outside of the internet with people is going to Magic the Gathering tournaments or occasional concert with associates who share musical tastes. On top of that, I work overnights at work. I am fine with this, cause it leaves my Friday and Saturday open for magic tournaments or if I wanna go to a concert. But now some guy at work is trying to get the overnight shift taken away and I would be forced on swing shift. This would ruin what little social life I have left.

497,0,"I started a new job 2 weeks ago in a bar. Never worked in a bar before but I'm a fast learner and it's something I've always wanted to try. When the bar is quiet, I absolutely love it. When the bar gets busy I have a meltdown. 3 times now I have had a panic attack in work because of how busy the bar gets.

 I should state that I've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks for about 10 years, but that I've been feeling really good and panic free for about 6 months, so what's happening in work at the moment is not new but unusual for present day me.

The first time the bar got busy and I panicked I was able to cry in the bathroom for a short while and pull myself together just enough to get through the last hour of my shift.

The second time it happened about 3 hours before I was meant to leave and I couldn't control it and I couldn't breathe and I had to go home. I felt so utterly useless and so stupid for stressing so much over making a few drinks.

The third time was 2 days ago. I had to leave the bar like 4 times because I was having a full blown panic attack. I stood outside for about 20 minutes at one point, just hyperventilating and dry heaving. The restaurant managers now know I have anxiety but my bar manager does not, and with how busy the venue gets I really cannot ask them to accomadate me.

This may be something I would get over after working here for a while but my panic attacks have just gotten worse every time it gets busy and I keep having nightmares now about work. I don't want to wait for it to possibly get better because currently I'm miserable.

I haven't stopped crying pretty much all day. I don't know when I'm next in work because they haven't sent me the fucking rota yet, I could be in tomorrow. I'm terrified and I feel sick and everything in me is screaming to not go back there.

Everyone there is so super nice and supportive and as I said I genuinely enjoy the job when it's quiet but I know as soon as I go back I'm gonna freak out again, busy or not.

I really want to quit, but I feel so useless to quit a job after only 2 weeks because it's a bit stressful, a job thousands of people do around the world no bother every day. This would be my second job to quit very soon after getting because I kept having panic attacks over it and I hate it I hate that that's me and I feel weak and stupid and pointless and I know I'm being crazy hard on myself but I haven't felt this bad in months so it really sucks.

513,0,"Hi all

I've been here for some time. Anxiety has been a passenger in my life since I can remember, but was only diagnosed at 30. A handful of years later, and two medications prescribed, I'm finally in a decent place.

Now, I still have anxiety issues, but the tie in since I was a child was overeating. Someone doesn't love me? Overeat. Friend thinks I'm too hyper? Eat more cake.

Generally every year, I gain some weight. I have never been on a downward trajectory. Add in getting married, buying a home, becoming a guardian to a teen, said teen leaving, and my husband leaving me without a care in the world, and to put it lightly I was plummeting.

Mainly because the ice cream never leaves me. Food is a comforting friend. I can get more. I am fortunate to live in a city where there are so many places to eat. My anxiety was (and still is) fueled by my knowledge of the easy and delicious relief only a short drive away.

But one month ago, I made one small choice. I've been trying to employ this mindset as of late that any progress is progress. And as I'm sure all of you can relate, you always wonder if it'll ever be enough. If you'll ever get to a place of calm. But I forced myself to take small steps. Even if it felt like torture.

And I mean small steps. I will bring one pencil upstairs with me, while I'm already on the journey, if I know it has to be put away in that area. One freaking pencil. Or one shirt. Nothing changes overnight but it does help some anxiety.

So one month ago. I decided to have a smoothie. Now, I am insanely weirded out by certain textures. One of them being seeds in fruit. For this reason, a lot of fruit is off limits for me. But I saw a mango pineapple smoothie that I felt I could enjoy. So I took a chance and got it with a work group.

I loved it. That night, I went to Trader Joe's having no idea what I was doing, and bought frozen pineapple and mango and juice. I made a smoothie the next day for breakfast. And the next.

I am now a month in, and I have NOT dropped 50lbs, (I wish, lol) but I feel so much better. My nails are long and healthy, I literally don't need coffee. I drink it once a week. And my menstrual cycles are significantly less painful.

Sure, there are plenty of times I eat like shit still, but every morning I have my damn smoothie. I do not have the same cravings. I do not have the same appetite. It's almost scary how much I have changed my body.

Today, I decided to treat myself and go to my favorite Chinese buffet. I had one plate. One cup of water. And the food did not taste like it used to. While I am a bit nostalgic for the rush of happiness that would come with a big plate of carbs, it was such an eye-opening moment for me, I had to take out my phone and write it all down.

So, here I am. Writing from a Chinese buffet. Only having had one plate of food. I don't want any more. I currently have no desire to overeat. And this has followed me and my anxiety for decades, and as cheesy at it sounds all stems from doing one little thing. 

Having something stable, in my case these damn smoothies, has changed me (and I'm pretty sure my gut biome) for the better. And it wasn't a big declaration. They were all small decisions. 

I love you all, and I no matter where you are in your struggle, or what it looks like - remember it is never too late. Try one thing. It's going to be tiny. But that is one step in the right direction. I am proud of myself and of all of you ❤️ Anxiety and My Progress With Overeating"

I am SURROUNDED by people who go to better schools than me (Ivy League) and I’m just a midwesterner from a state school not studying anything super challenging compared to these people. 

I always feel not good enough bc of where they all go to school. I am also female and the girls in this intern class are so pretentious that I find it hard to connect sometimes. 

Anyways, I thought I was killing it on my project (following the guidelines stated at the beginning of my project) but I led a meeting with my team, my boss and their boss and it was a terrible failure. I cried in the meeting and after the meeting and went home early bc it was that bad.

This just reassured me that I wasn’t good enough with that failure. The whole reason it went poorly was because of miscommunication prior to when I arrived and no one being on the same page about the direction of the project. 

I felt so dumb and with where I come from (school wise) I feel so stupid and inadequate. I know I’m hard working and a smart person but this is wearing me down. 

I need more help and direction but when I ask I keep getting more confused. I wake up anxious and upset every day going to work bc I don’t know what to do or how to move forward.

My best friend is my brother who I don’t see much as he’s in university so i live alone with my mum. The reason I don’t tell my mum about this is she’s depressed and without me she wont have anyone as she has few friends. Also i never talk about how i feel to anyone and i never have and when my mum asks if I’m ok I just say yeah. I don’t even like my mum at all and i hate myself for that because she’s done nothing wrong but she’s just so uninteresting and annoying. Even though I get annoyed by people when they do the slightest thing wrong but i never express my anger so the thoughts are just there in my head as i cant confront people about things. My life could be so much better but...
519,0,"Hello, fellow redditors! I am new to this subreddit and it seems like a great place for me to share the issues I am facing with anxiety.

For the past few years, my anxiety has been difficult on me. Ever since I moved from my small hometown to a capital city for a new job, I have never expected that my anxiety level would get so severe. After working at that job for 9 months, I tapped out and resigned. 

Every work day is the same feeling; the moment I reached the parking lot of the office, I felt so difficult just to get out of the car to get my ass into the office. My heart would start beating like crazy and my palms and feet would get all sweaty. I has definitely affected my work performance and tbh, my boss was not pleased. I just couldn't keep myself grounded during my time there.

I figured I could take some time off before getting a new job, but I still get so anxious even though I just stayed at home all day. My anxiety stuck with me until I got a new job, which I worked at until two months ago, I got sacked from the company because I didn't turn up to work for a week straight. I felt so miserable I didn't have the mood to do anything but to stay home and do nothing.

My anxiety has never been so bad before, and I just want to understand it better so that I can, at least, learn to deal with it better without letting it affecting my work and social life...

Hopefully I can get some answers from the threads here. Sorry for the long post, my first one on Reddit so thank you for reading it! For those who are dealing with anxiety: stay strong, deep breaths, things will get better! Anxiety from Work"

521,0,"It’s been almost two hours since he snapped me and I haven’t opened it. I want to but I also don’t want to because Snapchat lets people know when you’ve viewed their snap. It even sends a pop up notification when they’re typing?! 

I guess I’m afraid I’m gonna overthink what he sends me and I’m not gonna know how to reply and I don’t want him to see me type out a reply and delete it or see that I left him on read. Texting is much better because then I can look at the message and have time to process it and think of a reply.

Does anyone else get like this? I like him so much but the whole thing gives me so much anxiety that I just try not to interact with him too much. I think about him all the time but the thought of being vulnerable like that with someone scares me so I pull back. The guy I like just snapped me and I don’t want to open it because it’s giving me anxiety"

Now there are some problems here. 
1. I’m afraid my parents are gonna get on my case about saving money because I’m planning on moving out soon
2. The nature of the tops is troubling because they show some tummy, and my parents have made it clear that some tops aren’t meant for certain body types (I’m tall and do have a bit of a stomach) 
3. When I messaged and said I was going to the mall I said I wasn’t going to buy anything. I took the $50 with me. I bought the tops. They’re going to think I lied but I really wasn’t planning on buying any tops. 

Despite all of that, I love these tops. They’re soft and make me look and feel good about myself, rather than wearing something just to hide in. Why can’t it be that easy? Why do I have to cry over a couple of tops? That show 2 inches of stomach?

And it is getting progressively worse.

Every noise I hear I think it is someone breaking in and coming to attack me, which I know is irrational and yet it feels like a valid concern because it TECHNICALLY is possible. I used to do rounds of my house to make sure no one was hiding behind doors or under beds. I stay up until I’m exhausted and can’t keep my eyes open. And then I wake up every few minutes until morning and it is daylight again.

I tried to see a counselor for a short time but 30 minutes every 3 weeks wasn’t much help. She essentially told me to stop making the rounds (which I did) and to just ignore the fear. But then I had my first ever sleep paralysis in my bedroom. 

Ive tried leaving the lights on (makes me stay awake because I can’t sleep with the lights on), then I tried a blind fold to avoid the sleep paralysis (but I was more on guard for listening), so then I tried keeping the TV or white noise on. I’ve tried CBD before bed which I see is a trend on this site, but I can’t really tell if it helps.

Nothing I’ve tried is functional long term, and I end up exhausted and miserable physically and mentally.

527,0,"*KIND OF TL;DR IS AT THE BOTTOM*

I was always ""special"" kid and person. Extremely kind to other people to the point where my papered over emotions turned into extreme fears. I'm extremely good at writing, very intuitive in computers (I learn basics of all software in hours, always helping people solving trouble with their PCs) and getting keen on certain subjects to the point I had thought I'm somewhere on autistic spectrum, just not Asperger at all but a bit above (bc I understand sarcasm, irony and humour very well). I had always enjoyed cities, public transport, moody music and selection of certain, very specific topics, It's extremely hard to satisfy my taste.

I watch like four movies per year, read small amount of books, because of anxiety I spend lots of time making memes and low-effort creation (luckily, this is slowly changing and I'm working hard on those habits). Same goes with music, when only one out of 20 songs I listen I like and then I'm repeating it for one month.

I've always dreamt about going to fine arts studies; graphic design degree. I'm from small city and, being sure about my potential and fully prepared, I applied to two colleges in largest cities of my 32-million country - one being very prestige, second ""backup"" way easier to get into.

In my country daytime studying is **free,** which is extremely important because money/student loan problem does not exist in this story.

My country has got conservative fine arts traditions. To apply, you must pass the drawing exam which turns into complete random lottery when other 169 people try to get into your degree too. As you can guess, I didn't, while all my friends from art high school did. I was doomed and applied to applied linguistics instead, hoping for some solid learning, getting new languages, cool people etc. With my french maturity exam on 75% I placed last on list.

Those studies hit me very hard. Adding to my ongoing anxiety, I got literally depressed for first time of my life, hardly able to learn anything. You can see it by advancement of this post - I've probably made lots of grammar mistakes despite ""learning"" this english all year. My ""last hope"" grammar exam got marked as 50% and I must wait 'til September to try again. Most of time I just played fortnite, cried about being unusable. Even walking across my cursed campus was pain to legs, I got very tired from every simple task... I had spent lots of time trying to learn anything in library. And icing on the cake - people here were veeeery different than people in my art school. Absolutely different mindset made it impossible to talk with them. I ended up being almost alone, not single party for whole fucking year.

Jump to now, exam time. Slowly digging out of all the trash, passing exam after exam, writing e-mails to professors to ask them about later exam date. Using free psychic and therapist help. At this moment I just want to finish freshman year using my ""disabled because of depression"" cheat-code from GP and get the fuck outta there.

New year, new possibilities. I applied for graphic design again. Geared with packed, large portfolio drove to city of my dreams, capital of my country which lays only two hours from my hometown.

I got denied with laughable rating - 8 out of 30 possible points. Again.

And here comes the clou and main problem - I just can't accept any half-measures. I want to apply to this fucking certain degree and I just feel that I will got depressed again. Nothing can satisfy me - my language studies, cheap alternatives to art studies, studying something easy also.

Adding more, I'm constantly analyzing my life and comparing it to my dreams. I'm sad that I can't got any friends on current highschool; I feel like I waste my younghood. I had very precise picture of my ""student life"" and currently I feel like I'll never fullfill it. This may come from fact that ""playing with peers"" phase (8-13 year old) was unexistent in my life, because of my weird lifestyle and overprotective parents (they are OK now, they were overprotecting me only in plain school).

Maybe because of this I have this resentment to had perfect social life, full with going to clubs, hanging out on beautiful streets of my capital city, drinking alcohol on beaches and dancing around campfires??? I want to get paid for this dead phase on my life, get my childhood wasted in Minecraft and not having any normal friends back???

**Ending this wall of text, I have question - how to deal with this ""never satysfied with anything"" feeling. How to accept fact that I'm probably not going to my dream studies and not treat this as life waste? How to stop connecting studies with social life and choosing degrees which (in my mind) will guarantee me social life I've never had?**

Thanks for any responses in advance, pals! Even writing this down felt very therapeutic \^\^ I have urge to always choose the best option possible and I feel paranoid about not maximizing my potential - how to change it besides therapist help?"

I'm really thankful for the support from everyone in this community. I posted here so I that I may pay it forward - the old post gave me the push I needed when times were dark. Hopefully it can help anyone who is reading this also.

Being an irregular student does take a toll on you. Thoughts about being delayed made me feel embarrassed and ashamed. Oftentimes I felt alone and left out, group projects ended up being a solo thing for me and then I would think I wouldn't be able to finish it. When I enrolled on my last year, I had friends and relatives tell me they were excited that I was finally graduating. That expectation crippled me for a good portion of the year.

It wasn't because my family and friends weren't supportive - they were, they cheered me on. It was I that held me back. And I am glad I overcame my anxiety.

Thank you to this subreddit. It really does help to lift each other up. May we always give each other the boost we need! After seven years in college, I graduated yesterday!"
532,0,"I've had generalized anxiety disorder as long as I can remember, but wasn't diagnosed until I was in high school when I started feeling detached, and as if life wasn't real. I knew at this point I had to start therapy and figure out what was going on. Did cognitive behavioral therapy and group therapy for a solid 3 or so days a week for a summer. It helped, but I never really understood where exactly the anxiety was starting from. I couldn't place where or why it was happening. I wanted to go on SSRIs, but it wasn't really an option as my parents would not approve of it and I felt as if they underestimated how badly I felt sometimes. It wasn't until recently that I realized I only feel this anxiety when I'm bored. I know it's not going after the main origin of my issue, but I started realizing that my life could improve if I harnessed my issue with boredom and turned it into being productive all the time. I got a job, started college full time, started working out nearly every day, started eating less processed food, snowboard anytime I get the chance even playing video games or reading. I understand this might not be healthy, but my life has drastically improved, I have far less anxiety than I used to, and I've become a lot more fulfilled and happy. Not saying it's completely gone, I still get the occasional panicky feeling, but never full blown attacks. I'm not saying everyone should try this and I understand anxiety can worsen for some people by doing this, but for people like me that are used to being bored, start doing stuff even if it seems pointless like playing video games as it can interrupt that circular thinking  and even train your mind to stop thinking in a certain way. I am a psychology student, but nowhere near done with my schooling so take my advice with a grain of salt. Just wanted to share. I've used my anxiety disorder to propel me forward"

That disappeared for a while and then it came back even stronger, I started dealing with anxiety and panic disorders on a daily basis for like 2 months, I couldn't handle it anymore, I felt like I was stuck in a nightmare, a nightmare that would last forever.

For the last 10-12 months, I have been on a combination of Celexa and Wellbutrin. It has worked great for overall feelings, but I still have my isolated moments.

Now to what happened today. I work for a small aviation company and I am literally the only employee. We have contracted flight instructors but no other personnel. I sent out an instructor in one of the airplanes that we lease today. The problem is that the owner didn’t want that guy flying his plane. He told me this in passing months ago, but I slipped up and let the instructor take a 16 year old kid up for his birthday, which is about a 30 minute flight. Of course, it was a paid for by the customer. 

The owner called me fuming and cussing, which automatically sent me into a panic mode. He told me if it happened again, that he would remove the airplane from our company. He called me a few minutes later after stewing on it, this time even more pissed, and told me he was done and pulling the plane away from our business.

I was polite and apologized. The conversation ended, except it didn’t. Me being the type of person that CANNOT handle confrontation, I text him TWICE, apologizing. I immediately call one of my bosses (I have two, they are the owners of the company) and let him know what happened. He called his business partner, who had already been contacted by the disgruntled client, to try and form a game plan. They aren’t around a lot and weren’t aware the owner was picky, one even acted shocked.

I realize I shouldn’t have scheduled the instructor to fly that plane, but I honestly slipped up and forgot. Up until today, the last 6 months or so with this aircraft owner have been smooth sailing, and the owner admitted that. He has a reputation around the airport for being unpleasant.

I got really drunk and lost my mom and wanted to dance so I spotted a group of tall guys I could use as a wall because tons of people watch from the outside. Well as I approached I almost fell because of my damn shoes and caught myself on a guy. I apologized but don't think he heard me. So I just kept dancing. He looked at me and then stormed off. His friends looked at each other confused. I felt like a weirdo and tried to leave the really crowded dance floor and nearly fell on a group of girls after my legs had given up from dancing. Later on one of the girls would be really upset at me that I pushed her friend. I apologized but she said she didnt care so I said whatever. Then went to look for my mom. Anyways, I'm having really bad panic attacks over this. It's like a cringe that wont stop replaying in my head every second. I felt the guy thought I was coming on to him because I was dancing alone next to him. It made me feel like a weirdo that I might have made someone uncomfortable.

544,0,"Hey guys, so I’ve been searching online for other’s who’ve experienced the same thing as me. I haven’t had any success so I decided I’d make a post about it and see if anyone else suffers from this too.

I will put a TL;DR at the end of this post if you just wanna get to talking.

I’ve suffered with Anxiety and severe depression my entirely life, however, after having a panic attack on an insane amount of MDMA + whatever else was in those pills one night, I’ve since developed a crippling panic disorder, chronic depersonalization and substance anxiety.

Substance Anxiety: 

The way I describe substance anxiety is simple, it’s the worry and fear of something (caffeine, sugar, gluten, drugs, medications, melatonin pills, tylenol, cough medicine, nyquil etc.) changing my mental state or consciousness. 

After suffering a traumatic experience on drugs (once on ACID + WEED and once on MDMA + whatever else was in those two pills), I’ve developed “Substance Anxiety”. It’s gotten so bad that I would get panic attacks not only from trying to drink coffee, tea or hot chocolate, but also from eating too much sugar, gluten, or anything I’d consider to have possible mind altering effects (completely irrational fears). This crippling fear has also lead to the fear of ingesting any medications, such as tylenol, nyquil and even melatonin. 

This fear is simply, “waiting for it to “hit”. Waiting for the substance to take effect and essentially take control over your brain. 

I’ve since been put on Zoloft 50mg, and have been on this for 4 months. Needless to say the first month was torturous as I had to overcome my fear of taking a pill and knowing full well it would alter my mind. Currently, this fear has it’s grips on me in a different way, as I feel completely numbed out and brain dead on this medication, so now I’m living in the fear of having your mind altered. I wish to come off the medication due to the side effects, but again, my substance anxiety is taking control as cessation of the medication (I have talked to my doctor and plan to taper slowly) will illicit the fear of my mind suffering alterations, once again. 

I am doing better with substance anxiety in terms of letting it spiral into complete panic, I’ve been fine taking Zoloft every day, drinking decaf coffee sometimes, taking tylenol and even having a few beers.

So, if there’s anyone else going through “Substance Anxiety”, past substance abuse or anything related to anxiety of something altering your state of mind, feel free to discuss that here. 

What are you triggers? What substance terrifies you? Caffeine? Chocolate? Sugar? A specific food? Even smells (the smell of weed or tobacco causing the fear of a “high”)? 

TL;DR: Looking for a discussion and a place to talk about substance anxiety: The fear of something (caffeine, sugar, food, medications, smells) altering your state of mind and/or control of your mind. The fear you get when ingesting something and “waiting” for it’s “effects” to kick in. Discussion about past drug use is welcome, experiences with this fear, discussion about typical triggers, and tips and tricks to overcome this fear. Substance Anxiety (the fear of something changing your mental state), waiting for it to “hit”"

Just looking for advice and/or support. I’m fairly new to high level anxiety. It all kicked off when I became a new dad when my daughter got born. I saw a councillor for a little bit to try CBT, and I thought I was managing after that.


Now 18 months later my symptoms are back with a vengeance. “Bad butterflies”, panic attacks, general illness, and a feeling of going over the edge into mental breakdown is flooding into me over the smallest things.


All my tips for dealing with it like breathing, talking about it etc don’t seem to be working well either.

I quit in early 2018 though because I kept getting picked on by management. Since then I have gotten married and moved into my own place with him, but for the most part he is the one that has worked and made money for us. I have tried many different jobs like fast food and retail, even a call center since that's pretty much all that's in my area. I haven't been able to keep any of these jobs though because my anxiety gets to me so much that I quit within a couple days to a few weeks. 

I can't stand myself for it either. Some days I feel so useless for not being able to keep a job. However, I have finally had the courage to put in some applications and I have an interview in a couple days. I'm excited but also nervous that my anxiety will get the best of me. What can I do to keep this from happening??  Any advice dealing with strangers would also be appreciated!! Trouble keeping a job because of my anxiety and panic attacks?"
548,0,"I have had a lot of issues with therapy throughout my life. Some therapists insisted on diagnoses and treatment avenues that later turned out to not be helpful at all and only made me feel worse. Others were too passive, or completely at a loss at my situation, or I lost my ability to see them for some reason or another. As a result, I've developed pretty severe anxiety with building the trust I need to see a new therapist, to the point where I can't even make an appointment with a new office. My psychological situation isn't a simple one, and I feel anxiety about talking about all of my various issues and symptoms because I might be laughed at, ignored, or perceived to be dangerous to myself or others... I don't really think I could hurt myself or anyone else, but the anxiety isn't rational. 

My financial situation is strained lately and my anxiety/other mental issues is at the root of most of it. A few months ago, my insurance lapsed suddenly and the therapist's office didn't realize until I had gone to 3 appointments and racked up $180 in bills, which I've yet to pay. I stopped going, and when my insurance was fixed, it turned out that my therapist downsized her caseload and couldn't take me back. This is just another page in a long book of (what feels to me as) tragic failures on my part to keep myself in therapy. 

I have an opportunity tomorrow to fix this and make an appointment. I'm terrified to do so. I don't want to fail again. Therapy Issues"

It seems to have helped my depression a little...
But my anxiety is still very very bad.
I've been on it for 5 and a half weeks. Should I taper off or give it more time?

I also started buspar along with it a week ago... it just seems to make me feel a little dizzy, lightheaded and I have heart palpitations, but that only lasts for about half an hour. Not really sure if it's helping.

I'm also tapering off of kratom right now for those of you who know what kratom is.

553,0,"Hello. Have you ever been like obsessed with something or really interested in it like a character or a fandom or whatever that like when you feel like you need to take a break from it or your tired of it you start to get anxious? So after I watched endgame for the first time I got really interested In Nebula's character, because that was the first time I had really seen her character (I couldn't remember her from the other guardians movies or infinity war), so I started watching all the YouTube videos about her from other movies, and I looked up like everything about her and her past with thanks. I found her really interesting and I liked her personality, but I also felt a lot of empathy for her because of what happened to her. Then I got into fanfiction and stuff etc.. but it's been about two months now since I've seen endgame and like I was obsessing over nebula like almost every day lol, but eventually I felt like i was not as interested in her character? Like i still like her, but the videos and info about her past and stuff didn't elicit the same emotional response or shock value as before? I know that it's not new for me anymore so it's not going to but it just makes me feel very anxious and upset because I feel like I'm losing this character. It makes me anxious to move onto some other interest, and I like feel like I wish I could watch endgame for the first time again so I could get to know her character again. I am excited for gotg 3 but I'm sad there's nothing new about nebula? I think my main worry is that I'll forget about her character and then when new stuff about her comes out, like gotg 3 or whatever I want care? Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone else feels this way about her character, or any other character,  and if you could give me some advice? Thanks. Anxiety over losing a character?"

But I can’t stay over someone’s house at night. I just can’t do it. I don’t know why but my anxiety bring on lots of physical problems. Like I need to keep going to the toilet every 5minutes. But I feel like I can’t keep getting up and going because my friends will think I’m weird. And then I end up with really bad stomach pains and head aches. 
Last night my dad had to pick me up from my friends house at 1am because I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t handle it and I felt like crying. I just told my friends I was ill, even though I had been fine all day. So they were probably so confused. That isn’t the first time it’s happened either. I just don’t know what to do and I feel so alone. Because it’s such an embarrassing topic to talk about I can’t bring myself to tell my friends. The only people that know are my close family.

555,0,"I feel like being away at college was basically my mental prime. I had good grades, a job, social interactions, independence, and everything and when I graduated and moved back home it all got ripped from me all at once.

&amp;#x200B;

 I did well in school but I constantly second-guess my degree choice even though I should be able to find work with it pretty much anywhere, and the idea of a job interview is 1000x more stressful than I ever remember the ones I did for my college jobs. I drifted away from most of my friends because I'm ashamed that they all got good jobs with their computer science degrees and mines just collecting dust.

&amp;#x200B;

My lack of an ability to drive didn't impact me in school because I walked everywhere. Now I'm back out in a rural area and basically stranded in my house. The vehicle I used to practice in is gone, and the ones around for me to drive don't even belong to us (long story)

&amp;#x200B;

Don't really know how to conclude this. I started therapy and the ABC technique for CBT but so far it doesn't seem helpful to me because having to constantly second-guess my every belief is annoying. I consider myself pretty pragmatic so trying to dispute myself just feels like ignorance. Has anybody else had their anxiety worsen after graduating college?"

I'm extremely hyper-aware of my heart even though I am on BP meds and my pulse and blood pressure is always normal, but I can't seem to overcome the other symptoms. My stomach is tense, my throat is tickly, I feel unbalanced and dizzy with blurry vision sometimes (it's like a rocking sensation on a boat) and I feel the heat in my head. This latter one is the worst, it's like my head's going to blow up any time from this sensation. My question is: how do you cope with these kind of symptoms? Could they be from another disease or is it just anxiety? Hot weather is literally killing me - what should I do?"
558,0,"So I’ve been working at this job that isn’t horrible per se but I know can do better and it’s very very mentally taxing. I do what I can to cope and I do my job very well and get good recognition but I still can’t it. 
So aside from knowing this for months, that I need to move on, my anxiety about putting together my resume has kept me paralyzed. I just have had such a hard time and it’s been miserable knowing that there is a quick way to a better job but being so blocked from starting out.
So yesterday I FINALLY took my first step. It starting with my realizing I forgot the names of two of my old bosses and that I should probably look them up in case they ever leave the place. So I did and I put them in a note file. Then I looked up all the other names. So now I have a list of reference names and those are basically the jobs I’m going to put on my resume. The next step will be making descriptions of the jobs i did. I feel like I can conquer it better little by little because I now have some piece of coherent organization about my work history. Still anxious and I don’t know I’ll take the next step but at least I’ve taken that initiative. Finally put together some of my resume"

560,0,"I'm 34 (m), I have the recurrent obsessive fear that I'm losing my mind.  Best case scenario is my anxiety is skyrocketing, worst case scenario is that I have a form of literal dementia (originally spelled it as 'dimension') like Alzheimer's.

I was a heavy weed smoker for over a decade which led to definite and obvious declines in my memory.  I quit four months ago to see if I could reverse my memory loss and I was largely successful in that as my short term memory has vastly improved.  But other things have gotten a lot worse.  After about three months of thinking I've developed COPD (I got over that, luckily, no COPD) but certain quirks in the way I function are making me very scared of Alzheimer's.

Here's the list:

Word switching: will mean to say wallet and will say pocket.  Will mean to say living room, but say dining room.

Mispronouncing words: (especially switching the first letter of one word I intend to say with the letter of another I intend to say, IE spoonerism.)

Misspelling words: I'll just find my self completely focused on typing and lose track of how something is spelled.  I found myself trying to spell ""select"" as solect because I was pronouncing in my head with an 'o'.  As soon as I saw it I knew it was wrong, but I can see this misfiring happen all the time now.  I used to be really good at stuff like that.  Now, half the time I want to type 'knew' I type 'new'.  I'm messing up tenses more and my grammar seems to be taking a big hit as well...

Pressure in the back / upper part of my head.  It's never painful, the pressure is actually relatively mild, but its there practically all the time now.

Perceived change in how I read.  I'm constantly tripping up over words while I'm reading, like my head is filling in what the word should be before I give myself time to comprehend what's actually being written and it trips me up all the time.

I used to feel so eloquent, and I fancied myself a rather good communicator and now it feels like I'm majorly regressing.  I've been stressed before, and I've been depressed before, but this level of perceived cognitive decline is something I've never experienced.  I'm used to the feeling of not remember(ing &lt;- forgot to put an ing on the end of 'remember') what I was just saying, from when I was smoking so much weed, and I don't have that anymore, but I'm worried something is very wrong with me, and I feel like every time I experience any slight cognitive lapse, it triggers a very large amount of anxiety and thoughts that I may be developing Alzheimer's or some other form of progressive dementia.

I've read that people sometimes start experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer's in their 30's and I worry that's what's happening to me.  I honestly don't know whether to think I'm making myself go crazy, or whether I need to get an appointment with a neurologist.  I hate what this is doing to my wife, and I'm so scared of what my having dementia would entail for her and myself.

I honestly don't know if I want you guys to tell me I'm crazy or not.  But I'm in such a state of desperation, and I feel like it's all down hill for me for the rest of my life, and I'm scared out of my mind. Preoccupied That I Might have Dementia."

562,0,"My daughter’s voice causes me to have extreme anxiety reactions.


It’s not all the time or even very often. She can just reach a certain pitch that makes me feel like my ears a vibrating like a tuning fork or like I have that creepy feeling you can have when you think someone is watching you. She has a particular skill at hitting the frequency, or whatever it is, when she whines and it makes me crazy. The more she does it, the more I have the urge to tape her mouth shut. I don’t, I hope that’s obvious, and I’ve tried to remind her that that tone is very stressful for me. She usually tries to fix it, but at 6 she is going to either forget or simply be too self-involved to care that it’s damaging to my psychological well being. It’s begun to mean when I hear that particular “Maaaaamaaaaa?” I have to clench my teeth because it is physically painful as well.


Does anyone have any advice on how to handle triggers that you can’t avoid but are making your reaction increasingly strong?  I would never hurt her, especially as it’s her voice, not something she can get rid of, but I am seriously struggling.

Initially I just felt my heart and breathing speed up but it got more and more intense the closer it got to my turn. By the time it reached my I barely eeked out my name.

Ever since then I’ve taken a beta blocker in preparation of these types of introductions.

I've always struggled with anxiety, but more often than not, I could push it down and do what I needed to do without massive freak outs or panic attacks. But now, I can't even go out with my boyfriend if he's with his friends because I don't know them.

I was bullied a lot as a teenager, mostly for my weight or my ""weirdness"", but I had friends who I thought supported me and loved me for who I was so I did okay. But after the falling out I had with my now two ex best friends, my anxiety of what people are thinking of me has escalated. Long story short, I found out that my ex best friends thought if me exactly what I was afraid people would think of me. Now, I don't have many friends, and the few I have I keep at arm's length because I can't be sure if they really like me for me. It sounds so stupid, and I hate that I care so much about what people think about me. I never use to, not really. I've made some progress with being able to love myself and the way I look, but I still can't help agonizing over other people thinking I'm strange, or annoying, or whatever.

My boyfriend understands 100% and he never pushes me or makes me feel bad about not wanting to go with him, but I want to get to know his friends. I want to be able to go to a party and have a nice time without shrinking into the corner close to tears because I've over exaggerated something in my mind.

For the last several years I’ve had anxiety. Don’t know which type as never been able to get proper help. Only been said/kinda labelled by councils and first aiders/paramedics. If you are wondering why, it’s due to my family’s crazy beliefs and them taking pride over anything. 

For the last year or so, particularly in the last six months my mental health has severely worsted due to life I guess. Family have been much worse so had to leave. Since moving it’s been so much worse and I’m concerned it’s more then anxiety now....these days I have little or no motivation to do basic things like showering, eating, socialising and more.

Seeing stuff like that on paper just feels nice and reassuring. And the fact it came from me &amp; my terrible selfhating mind just feels.. different. Its warm.

The last few weeks have been soul crushing &amp; I haven't felt more anxious in my life, and my mind is racing 500 miles so whenever I feel anxious (cause when I do I usually cant work right, I get so frozen which spikes my anxiety more) I write reassuring words on paper. Its helped a lot. My mind was screaming ""you wont be fine, youre fucked, its over for you, just quit"". Now, its gone quiet. Don't knock it till you try it.

Whenever I have trouble I just look at it and I get a boost. I even drew a smiley face to help. It feels pathetic and I wish I didn't have to babyfy myself but fuck does it help. My production is up and my anxiety gets less and less (due to my education causing my anxiety).

Tbh, you do need faith to make it tho. It won't work if you don't believe those words. I am forcing myself to do it and I am starting to believe it myself now. I feel like I really am going to be fine but I am putting in work and doing my best, too. It helps when you are not bothered by your thoughts.

Just try it. Write reassuring stuff &amp; keep it close. Whenever you feel bothered, just look at it and realize it came from your own mind. Its different than when other people tell you ""you will be fine"" because they don't know you as good as you know you.

But the fact it came from YOU? From your own mind? That is some powerful shit. If you haven't tried writing kind words to yourself, you should. It sounds silly but it really works."

584,0,"A little bit of a background,

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago this girl approached me out of nowhere and suggested that we hang out. we started  to hang out and spent a lot of time together. We started to grow closer and over the next week or so, she opened up about her (often moderate to severe) anxiety and her diagnosed OCD. As we spent time together and talked to each other, I began to develop romantic feelings for her and by the way she has acted/talked I think they were mutual, at somewhat. I am a college student and moved back home a couple of weeks after we met for summer break. She began to call every day and we often talked for hours about random things, but when she was has having a panic attack and her obsessive thoughts began to happen I was there to support her and reassure her. She apologized often and I reassured her that I didn't mind listening at all and that I was there for her. She mentioned that she felt that this was more than just a purely platonic friendship, but that she wanted to take things slowly and I assured her that I was fine with that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, a few weeks ago I drove down to where she lives and we spent the day together. We were having a great time and I felt like we were continuing to get closer. However, about an hour before I left she began to have a panic attack and alot of it revolved around relationships and how she felt confused and non-committal. We had talked about these things before and I had encouraged her to take her time, however, this time I acted hurt and took things personally even though I know they weren't meant that way. She ended up asking for space to ""save me some pain"" and over the past few weeks I have tried to give it to her. Once I realized that the way I acted wasn't fair to her and all that, I called her and apologized. She thanked me but insisted that it wasn't necessary. She has reached out several times since then, but she has been kinda distant and cold and I don't think she is in a very good place mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

This may seem premature having only known her for a few months, but she matters a lot to me and I want to be there to support her. I feel like shit because of the way I handled last time and the feeling that she is pushing me away hurts a lot. I'm moving back in about a month and I really don't know where to go from here. I want to show her that I care for her and that her anxiety and OCD aren't going to hurt me and drive me away but I don't know how. How do I manage this whole situation, especially since I have romantic feelings for her?

I was having a crap day and had been feeling anxious all week and decided to go hang out with friends because anxiety shouldn't prevent me from having fun. We hang out for a while and I have a anxiety attack. Heart rate goes up to 180 with me just sitting down, it's hard to breath, my head is spinning.  Thankfully my friends are calm and help me. I still have that not quite comfortable in my skin feeling the whole time but otherwise it was good. I finally get home and I have another bout of anxiety. My friends call me and eventually I feel better.

I'm always worried that I bother my friends by being anxious but days like this remind me that my friends 1. Care about me and 2. Aren't bothered by it and just want to help me. Anxiety sucks but friends are the best"

It's so goddamn frustrating when I'm just minding my own business and just get that awful sinking feeling in my face. Always at night, I swear. When I'm supposed to be winding down and getting ready for bed, it just comes up in pangs and punches me in the gut.

589,0,"So I've mentioned my increasing anxiety to psychiatrists before and they prescribed Buspirone, 10mg TDS and recommended mindfulness courses or books. Instead of mindfulness I was offered 4 sessions of CBT. Which didn't help. 

I was initially on Buspirone for a month or two and re-prescribed it 2 weeks ago, after a few months break in which time my anxiety hit a new low. (perhaps I'm not giving the med time to work?) I've still not got an official diagnosis of any anxiety disorder (just that it 's thought to be related to my autism).

Do you think I should ask for a diagnostic assessment? For some of my MH conditions it helped for others it didn't. How does an anxiety diagnostic assessment work/differ to other psychiatric diagnostics (in the UK)? Would it help with other treatment options? (can you even take buspirone long term?)

I know you can't answer this question medically but any personal experiences from those in the UK would be much appreciated. Thank you :) My anxiety isn't getting much better, should I ask for a diagnosis to help tailor my treatment? (UK based)"

When certain people message me, I will avoid going on Facebook so the person who messaged me doesn't know I'm avoiding them. There have been times where I take days to read and message anyone back. Doing this also gives me anxiety because I worry the person will figure out what I'm doing, take it personally and get mad at me. Most of the time I don't know what to say right off the bat and I have to sit down and be mentally prepared to message anyone.

593,0,I'm 27/M and have just moved out of my family home to a house with two friends. I get on well with those two and the house is about 15 minutes away from home in a quiet enough inner city area. The change from outer suburbs to inner city means there's a lot more random noises and people around plus as it's inner city it's slightly less safe (but it's a relatively safe place anyway). It's nearly been a month already and I find it hard to sleep nearly every night if my girlfriend isn't around or if I'm not at her place. It's all very new to me so I'm just looking for a bit of advice to settle in and cope with the change. Thanks! Does anyone have any tips for someone with anxiety who's just moved out of their family home and is finding it hard to settle in?
594,0,"Does anyone else here get like body pains (or any pain in general, headaches, sudden chest pains, chest tightness etc.) And then instantly feel like you're dying or gonna die cause something could be happening to you. One simple headache will sent me into thinking "" damn man like I just got to start enjoying my life without being super depressed (17yo) this sucks I have brain cancer and I'm gonna die . Like damn. **That sucks** 

I realize that it is anxiety along with tight chest pains I get cause the chest pains go away and obviously I don't have a headache all the time . It just sucks it's like a loop that I get stuck in where I'll get anxious then feel like I'm dying but know that it's probably anxiety I just can't quite convince myself that , that is the case?

Any advice helps I know there's not gonna be any like instant fix to it and it's not as bad as it was in the recent past of being thrown into panic attacks cause of it but it still lingers and it helps my mental to just tell somebody **anybody** especially late at night (early in the morning really I guess) posting here cause everyone is my house is asleep and I don't wanna interrupt their sleeping for me feeling anxious cause I feel bad but like I said even just posting it here for anyone to see does help

Also I get anxious right before falling asleep usually it's this weird thing where like letting myself go unconscious and actually go into sleep is scary for me most of the time cause I get anxious about like ""what if I don't wake up?"" Even though obviously I do and I have for the past, well **17 years** 

**TL;DR** I have anxiety right before bed and also hypochondria and posting about it in here helps just cause somebody will read it and just knowing that helps but if you can give me any nice words thank you beautiful human reading this :D

598,0,"Hello everyone. Here’s some context: About 5 months ago, I broke up with my boyfriend (both of us were in high school — I was a junior and he was a senior). He didn’t necessarily do anything wrong to me, but we didn’t work out and I decided to end things. I do not miss him at all, and in fact feel better alone. I have OCD which forces me to constantly think of things that I don’t want to think about.

Recently, whenever something important/meaningful happens in my life now (like embracing a very close family member, or blowing out candles for my birthday), I think of him. I don’t think of him fondly, but I am reminded of his existence. Oftentimes, all I can think is “I don’t want to think of you [my ex-boyfriend].”  I now feel like I see him in everything, even though I don’t want to. I just want him gone from my life.

Since I am a rising senior in high school, I’m touring colleges, and recently found my dream school. However, when I was there, all I could think about was my ex-boyfriend. I was trying to enjoy walking around the campus, but all I thought was how much I didn’t want to think of him.

The thought of him is putting a stain on everything in my life. What can I do to regain my life back from his presence? Is this an OCD issue?

Thank you in advance. Whenever something important/meaningful happens in my life, I think of someone that I don’t want to remember (male, 17)"
599,0,"First time on this sub because I know my anxiety is about to cause a Huge fight when my partner gets home.

My boyfriend is a groomsman for one of his best friends since childhood. I don’t know the bride or grooms very well, met the bride probably twice although we’ve joked and traded memes on Instagram and she seems cool. 

Wedding is about an hour away, I went to the ceremony and while there I sat near the four people I know, but I don’t really know them that well, except for one.

The one is a guy I went out with for a few weeks. He’s another childhood friend of my bfs, and I met bf thru him. Yes it’s weird. He’s married now to a wonderful woman, but while he’s not a bad person he’s sure not my favourite person. There were some consent issues for the time we were seeing each other. Looking back I’m angry at how I let that stuff slide. 

Anyways, I went to the ceremony, but it wasn’t too bad because you’re supposed to focus on what’s happening. I had to go home between the ceremony and reception to let my dog out.

When I get to the reception, I found out that not only is there a head table so my bf won’t be sitting with me (he told me there wasn’t) but I’m at a table with six people I’ve never met, plus exbf and his wife.

I wound up melting down in the bathroom, and then couldn’t leave because I didn’t want anyone to ask why my face looked like shit. Found an emergency exit and snuck out.

Had to go on public transit while still crying. Finally get home and bf has sent me a snarky text message. Half of me is incredibly pissed off that he wouldn’t have told me these things beforehand, and the other half is just dying of guilt.  

So now I get to continue my anxiety cry plus add guilt tears on the couch while watching Friends and cuddling Dog.

Anyone want to join my pity party? I just went to a wedding for two minutes, spent 45 minutes crying in the bathroom before sneaking out."

601,0,"In 2018 June/July, I had unprotected had sex with my then new partner. A month later he told me he was Hepatitis B positive- but if I am vaccinated I am safe and will not get infected. I was both shocked because he had not told me earlier, in denial because we had already had sex &amp; of course generally stressed out with what I had heard. Due to the sheer intensity of this news &amp; to see him emotionally bogged down by any conversation around this conversations, I moved forward somewhat in denial. I accepted what he said about being vaccinated &amp; held belief that I am protected, I turned a blind eye to what the reality might be, had faith that I will not get infected and willingly continued to have sex with him. Initially with protection a few times, and eventually without. However this continued to bother me inside - and even the idea of getting tested would make me fearful. 


Approximately 8/9 months later April, I bucked up the courage and got tested. Very fortunately, the rest reports were negative. I then directly asked my boyfriend to take to me a doctor (this was the second or third time) as I still had lots of questions in my mind- to which he agreed - but we never went. Again, in fear of upsetting him I didn’t bring it up again. 

Three months later while in a conversation with him - I brought up my interest in going to a doctor. He responded saying ‘We already went’ / which then I realised was a slip from his side. He had taken another girl he had an intimate scene with to a doctor. 

He took a girl he was having a scene with to the doctor. But not somebody he is ‘serious’ with. His excuse to this is that I never insisted. 
Is that fair? I’m very anxious about everything that has happened, and I’m not sure if any of this seems right? 

I am feeling heavily taken for granted &amp; also on some level cheated, because if going to the doctor is a measure that needs to be taken and he was already aware of (also has done before) then I should have definitely by himself taken me.  

What should I do next? Dating someone with Hep B ANXIOUS AF"
602,0,"Yesterday I got to see one of my best friends in the first time in a while. He has been hiking the AT. He brought some friends he met on the trail over to his family's house and invited me over. 

I should preface this to maybe help my perspective make more sense. I never smoked pot until I was 22 but then I smoked daily for almost 2 years. I recently stopped as I needed to clear a test for a job. I have however smoked once every few weeks or so. 

So we end up smoking at this little get together and Iui also had a beer which I next to never drink. I became so introverted and possibly even paranoid. It seemed like I was just in the way and there. I seemed to not be able to help or attribute myself to setting up or helping clean. It seemed I only offered my help cleaning when it was part way done. I felt bad for this.  Before smoking I did manage a few conversations with the hikers who I had never met. Got to chat music a little and just enjoy casual small talk. Once I smoked. Nothing. I was almost watching myself outside of my body just being awkward and there. I didn't feel like I belonged. The fact I was even having these thoughts and feelings seem so dumb to me but it's something I couldn't really get out of my head. 

How do I ever actually have conversations? What do you talk about? I work in a place where I talk to hundreds of people daily but I just couldn't find real conversations last night. I found myself so lost in time and overthinking everything. For a bit I thought my friends dad was talking about me from the other room but that could honestly have been paranoia  from the weed. 

I used to be very good at having friends and being social but I just feel I'm losing grip on those skills. I've always been fine at even introducing myself to people and making friends. After the 2 years of smoking I just don't  have it. 

My friend offered to drive me there and I accepted although I wanted to drive and have that control. As the night grew late and all were getting ready to watch a movie and head to sleep I offered for my departure. My friends dad said I could stay and so did my friend. This wasn't part of what I thought would happen and it caught me by surprise. In my anxiety ridden mind I thought it was out of pure sympathy... but these are people I considered family most of my life because of how much they had been there for me. I simply couldn't accept and my mind raced 'where would you sleep ' 'you don't know these other people' 'what if I say stupid things or just don't fit in.' 

Dumb stuff but it happened. I did leave after insisting a few more times within the hour and I still feel so guilty and bad for this. I don't know how to Express any of this to my friend sincerely. I know I'll see him again soon. He heads back for the trail today as yesterday was a rare off day. He will be done in a few weeks and we've planned an idea for a hike. I feel like then I will be able to have a better 1 on 1 convo and try to explain. 

I feel broken almost. Lonely. I fear of being alone the rest of my life because I lack the ability to just breathe and be myself in a group setting. I wish I would have said no to the weed and just been sober. This jumbled mess of whatever I just said should be evidence enough that I have no clue what I am doing. Seeing a friend"
603,0,"I have extreme anxiety when talking in front of groups of people. My latest 3 presentations have been complete nightmares, my voice is noticeably shaky, my throat feels so tight i cant get a word out, i turn bright red, heart pounding out of my chest and sometimes i get hand and even leg tremors.

The odd thing is i am not normally a shy person at all! I excelled at all my customer service jobs, can easily and comfortably talk to strangers, talk on the phone, speak to small groups of people, and my current job which is in sales i am great at because i am only talking 1 on 1, or if its in a group its more a conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any coping mechanisms for this crippling fear and anxiety that comes from presenting infront of others?

604,0,"For the past four days, I've been having a hard time breathing. My heart was skipping beats, and my back and side was in tremendous pain. Finally, after worrying, I decided to go to the hospital. I thought I was having heart palpatatuons/ arrhythmia, and that my lungs were collapsed. 

They performed an ekg, x-rays on my lungs, blood tests all to come back negative. Other than being a bit overweight, I'm healthy.  I look at my wife tearfully and say, ""there's no way that this is ANOTHER week long anxiety attack."" (Had one a few months back, peppered in were more smaller attacks)
 
Sure as shit, when the doctor walks in, he says ""so you said that you have had a week long panic attack before, this is looking pretty similar.""  

I'm dumbfounded. I mean I'm glad that my heart isn't exploding, or that my lungs are failing, but goddamn, I don't know how much more of this I can take. Half-a-week long anxiety attack."

I’m a new Mom and I just feel even more completely alone than I ever have before. I am desperate for meaningful friendships. I know nothing good develops out of desperation. I can’t find friends because I’m too anxious to reach out and talk to people. I just feel like I’m bothering everyone I come in contact with and they can smell my desperation. 

All the new Moms I run into seem to already have Mom friends. I don’t. I don’t have any friends really, it is embarrassing really how little I mean to “friends” I do have. Im never anyone’s first call or thought. I’m an after thought friend. 

I’m so sad and frustrated. I just want someone to text with, to chat with, do Mom and non-Mom activities with. I’m too anxious, every time I say anything to anyone in this one Mom group I’m in a Facebook chat with, I feel like I’m going to puke waiting for them to respond. And then when they do respond, I just end up regretting saying anything because I don’t think anyone likes what I’m saying or gets me.

607,0,"This is my first post here. Or anywhere for that matter regarding my issues. I usually try to hide how I feel to others. But I still feel like people can tell, or that people are constantly judging me. The inspiration for posting this came from scrolling through and reading this thread and r/depression. A lot of it is all relatable. I feel like I wanna just unload absolutely everything on here because I want to reach out and have others hear me. Others outside of my circle, which is a small circle btw. Just family and friends I can count on one hand. But to them I hide behind a mask. 

I could go on and on starting from the beginning and telling all, but the bitter irony is just the thought of that alone gives me anxiety. Like, I wanna structure it properly and don’t wanna leave out important things. OCD in a nutshell. 

I can start by admitting I’m 26 but feel like a kid inside. It’s ridiculous. Still live with my father.I didn’t grow up properly because I’ve been through alcoholism and drug dependency. And my parents, love them to death, but enabled/babied me for a long time, too long I’ll admit. And I feel like those things kept me the age inside I was when I started. I’ve tried different medications for depression&amp;anxiety, currently on Wellbutrin, but idk if it is really helping or not. I try to convince myself it is, because I wanna feel normal. 

Like I’ve said, I can go forever trying to cover all my shit. Like my OCD, relationships, more in depth about my alcoholism and drug use, yada yada yada... I might go further into detail in future posts, but as for now, I’ll get to the point, the thing I’m going through right now. I’ve been in and out of several different jobs and periods of unemployment. I’ve fucked up and lost 2 jobs because of drugs and alcohol. Worked a part time summer job last summer. Got laid off and drew unemployment. And as that came to an end had to find something new. I’m not in as bad of a position that I have been before. Actually I’m coming up on a year and a month alcohol free. In January I started as a paid on call firefighter. And May I started as a deckhand on the river, something that I’ve wanted to do for a while and applied to many companies and fought hard to get here. I’m currently on the boat as we speak. But here’s the thing, now I realize that it is not for me. The work is fine, yeah it’s hard but I can deal with that. It’s the 28 days on/14 off schedule. And 6hrs on 6hrs off. During that time I have hardly any time to myself. Which is much needed for someone with anxiety and depression, to decompress and have some alone time. Gotta constantly wear the “I’m not a nutcase and I don’t hate life” mask..it’s the one with a smile. And being away from home for so long is harder than I thought it would be. So now I’m in the process of trying to get off early. I’m 2 weeks into my trip and there is a crew change coming up in 3 days, but not my scheduled crew change. So if I get off they will probably terminate me. Which I almost can’t afford, but really don’t wanna be out here anymore. There’s a job 20 minutes from where I live that I applied to a couple days ago. I’m really hoping I get it so I have something to fall back on. My dad is disappointed that I’m quitting, and has also said that if I come home I won’t be able to stay with him much longer because he can’t “support” me anymore. I get it. I just really hope everything works out. Not sure what I’m going to do."

I was doing so well. Yesterday, I was almost back to normal. Then, my Grandfather was diagnosed with a blockage by his heart and we found out that he might need surgery to fix it. Now, I'm ridiculously worried about him and my stress has skyrocketed again.

My friends are flying in on Monday to visit, and then we're all flying out for a week in Beverly Hills. I'm scared that because of all of this otherworldly anxiety, I won't be able to enjoy the visit and trip as much. I don't want to put a damper on things for them.

609,0,"My car has been acting up so while I price out what it's going to cost to fix I thought id have a look round to see what I'd replace it with if it turns out uneconomical to repair.

So the first dealer I went to seemed to not care that I was walking round and looking into one model in particular.  I was just about to walk out and he said hello.  Ended up taking a car for a test drive.  Was OK but had a few electrical issue so decided even if I buy one it wouldn't be this car.  I dropped it back and, as the guy was with another customer, just stuck my head on the door and said thanks but it wasn't for me.  He said ""was that the way you found it?"" and pointed to the car.  I thought maybe he was asking about damage or something so I said yes it's the same.  He said ""no it's not, it was backed into that space not driven in"".   I looked at my partner and just said I wasn't confident backing a car I wasn't familiar with into a small space amongst new cars.  As I walked off I could hear him making fun of me to his other customer.

He had another car on the yard I was interested in but given his attitude I decided I'd rather drive 30 mins to another dealer I knew had one to try that.  Got there and they were very nice. Had heaps of the model i wanted to try so could narrow it down.  I told them I wasn't looking to buy today but was just trying to narrow down my options which they seemed happy with. Took it for a drive.  Was very nice and I think was def what I wanted.  Got back and was ushered into a sale manager's office (who referred to my partner as my ""sprog"") who started doing finance paperwork.  When I said I had explained I didn't want to buy today he just ignored me and started quoting different finance options.  When I eventually managed to get through to him I didn't want to buy a car today he seemed very upset and basically couldn't get rid of us fast enough.

All in all was a horrible experience car shopping.  On the plus side my current car will basically need to be falling apart before I go shopping again. Mentally exhausted with car dealers"

She tends to sit next to me when she has the chance, speedwalks away from any conversation I start (I do the same), and won't make eye contact with me for long (she turns away."". I've given her a few gifts casually, that she just kind of awkwardly mumbled a ""thanks"" for and then turned away. I have no idea if she feels the same or our respective anxieties have just given me false hope.

But so far ALL I am feeling is anxiety. Almost like I could have a heart attack at times, even when I am not at work. These feelings won't go away. I can't stop overthinking. I can't stop doubting my capabilities. I feel like a fraud. I want to cry. I can't sleep. It is such a weight.
My family needs this to work out. Congratulations!!"
614,0,"I've always had anxiety. Not crippling, but deffo life changing, makes things difficult. Daily things are hard to do and take willpower.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got ill after drinking alcohol, as normal, only this time I worked out that what I was feeling was actually an irritated stomach. Took some antacids, drank some milk and I started feeling better.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm seeing that the feeling of anxiety that haunts me through most days is really really helped by having something soothing in my stomach. I've known for a while that if I don't eat life gets unpleasantly scary, so try to eat regularly - but this is the next step?

&amp;#x200B;

If I keep myself sipping milk or even water - i feel much better... Is this just because of the gut brain connection, I'm feeling my anxious state through my gut and keeping my gut nice and calm helps in that way, or... Do I have some kind of issue with my gut that is driving my anxiety?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I try a different diet or something, what do you guys think? Anxiety or... maybe, suddenly realise, stomach troubles?!"

I shake.. I go days without sleeping, I can’t eat anything, I vomit days at a time, my vision goes blurry, I’m nauseous throughout the whole day and I become incredibly weak.

I don’t know what’s wrong however. I’ve had brain scans, blood tests, medication, hospitalisation.. I’m starting to lose my mind..

It’s crazy because I never know when or why it’s coming.. and it usually lasts only a week.. and then stops as quickly as it started..

I know I need to speak to my GP but I was just wondering if anyone has been through this before. Have you kept taking them, have you had to plan before hand and stop? 
I guess I just want real life experiences to have an idea..
Thanks :) Anti depressants and pregnancy?"
617,0,"I've been working in my new job for a month now.

This was a new experience for me for many reasons but now there's nothing to worry about anymore and yet I still experience especially the stomach pains when I'm getting ready or think about going there.

I am so fed up with this situation. I faced my fears and I shouldn't feel anxious anymore and yet the symptoms still appear every time.

EDIT: I forgot to mention eating problems I have. Mainly because of how my stomach reacts I have a hard time getting myself to it anything before going. It's a whole painful process for me and I usually end up eating what a normal breakfast would be throughout the entire day. I'm shocked I don't pass out etc. cuz I never eat this little. But most times I don't even feel that hungry after such a small meal.

I thought I'd just have to go through this at first and then it would get better, but it doesn't and I don't really feel half as anxious about everything else I do! I am sick of feeling anxious every morning before going to work. I know there's nothing to be frightened about"
618,0,"I had a seemingly random/sudden onset anxiety attack 30mins ago. General extreme life/work stressors going on. And trying to pick a place to eat dinner with my wife and her picky/annoying family visiting sent me over the edge. I excused myself and went upstairs to the bathroom as its the only place I knew Id be able to break down/freak out in peace. Hyperventilating/rocking/stimming (aspie) whole 9. Decided to just take my clothes off and sit in a cold shower for the first time ever and IT WORKED! My hearts still pounding but as I stand in my bathroom wrapped tightly in a warm towel I feel really proud that I finally discovered ANY way to bring down my anxiety besides ""letting it pass"" which always resulted in getting way way worse before it got better. 
Now to get through dinner 🤞 Self soothing"
619,0,"My therapist said she thought it would be good for me to interact with a community of people similar to me, so after reading posts here for over a year I've finally made an account. I want to use my first post to thank everybody here. Deciding to see my doctor last year was absolutely terrifying; I was so worried that I'd be laughed out of the doctor's office and told there was nothing wrong with me and I was making it all up. Reading peoples' experiences here that matched so well with what I was experiencing gave me the courage to finally make that appointment.

 

In hindsight I shouldn't have been worried about not being taken seriously. I went into my appointment so anxious that I had a heart rate of 130 and was barely able to form coherent sentences. My doctor put me on medication, and after a few months I was doing well enough I was able to start seeing a therapist. I've got a long ways to go but I've made a lot of progress so far. Finally seeing someone about my anxiety was easily the best decision of my life, and I hope anyone reading this who is on the fence about reaching out for help like I was decides to do it. That first step really is the hardest, but it gets a bit easier after that. First post here, want to thank you all"
620,0,"I’m 22F and I’ve been dealing with some really bad anxiety for the past year. My anxiety is mainly future oriented, and tiny things can trigger me into an anxiety spiral that leads to a panic attack. For example - if a friend makes a comment about a cute couple, I start to think about how maybe I’ll never be in a relationship again/part of a “cute couple”, I start to imagine myself living all by myself when I’m old, imagine myself with no kids or grandkids, etc. Then once I get home and am in my room I’ll begin hyperventilating and have a panic attack. 

So as you can probably tell I am absolutely terrified of being lonely. Anytime I want to get something to eat or do something fun I force myself to invite a friend because I don’t want to be in public by myself. It’s absolutely awful and I feel clingy but I think I just get scared that doing an activity alone means that I am one step closer to being alone for the rest of my life. Irrational, but I can’t seem to think a different way. 

I’ve been seeing a new therapist, and last week she said that my therapy homework was to go to a movie by myself. Even the thought of it absolutely terrified me. I was planning on lying and saying I did it, but today I decided that I don’t want to live this way anymore. I realized that if I lied it would serve me no benefit, and that maybe she had a point. Maybe learning to enjoy my own company does not mean that I will never be able to enjoy someone else’s company. 

It took me four hours to convince myself to drive to the theater and another 20 mins of sitting in the parking lot. But I did it. I went and saw toy story 4 - it was a good movie. My friends had been wanting to all go see it together but I didn’t let that stop me. I did it by myself and I felt great walking out of the theater. Don’t know when I’ll do that again, but for now I’m just really happy I was able to do it today. I went to the movies alone for the first time tonight"

So I just presume they’ll ask me next weekend. Nope. Now a year has passed. The date on my messenger app says last message received a few months ago.

How do I deal with this mentally? I don’t want to take the easy way out just because of that, but I’m so bored seriously, and so so hurt. It hits me every day, every morning, every night, like a big gap in my heart. I know they still see each other, which makes it even worse. It’s been a year since all my close friends has dropped contact, how do I continue indifferent"
622,0,Hi reddit! So I’ve been invited out to drinks with an old friend who I haven’t talked to in years.. I’ve been so alone and I know I really really need this in my life.

624,0,"Does anyone else find themselves joking around and like bantering, but anxiety is just in the back of your head wondering if they actually meant it? I find myself (usually if it’s over text) subtly in between if they actually meant it and this time I just feel like I ruined the whole atmosphere, and then anxiety kicks in and it has me wondering “oh had this ruined it forever? It’s not gonna be like it was” I just hate feeling so thrown out and insecure when I KNOW we’re just joking and I KNOW it’s just anxiety. Messing up the atmosphere?"

I think there's an issue with communication and personalities and it's starting to give me major anxiety in the workplace. I feel like there is zero room for error. 

Most of our issues should be solve-able with better communication, and I do intend to have it. However, I also think that my anxiety might make me over think myself and may be triggered by her. Not sure if I should disclose my anxiety or just deal with this communication issue in a different way. Anxiety and a difficult boss"
626,0,So my girlfriend gets upset because she feels like she holds people back from doings things they want to do with her because of her anxiety. She thinks it’s going to make everyone sick of her and I just need to know how to help because I love her :( Need Help/Advice!
627,0,"So today I went over to my boyfriend's house to hang out and watch movies and stuff but I was having massive anxiety all day beforehand because we were having dinner with his parents and I HATE eating in front of people. What if I eat weird? What if I don't have anything to talk about? The main thing going through my mind was basically they're gonna judge me. It was just getting to the point where I didn't even want to go and every time I thought about it I felt sick. But, the time came and I actually did it! The food they had was a bit messy and that made the anxiety bad at first but I got over and and even thought of stuff to say and talk about. I'm just super proud of myself for not bailing (like I've done before for other events) and actually enjoying it. Plus the time went by really fast so it was over with before I knew it. Anyway, just thought I would share here since here seems like the right place to :) I successfully had dinner with my boyfriend's family!"
628,0,"I transferred to a new school last fall, and it was a really amazing experience.  It was my first time living on my own, and I really lucked out with an amazing group of friends.  Combined with the beautiful environment (the college is forest-adjacent) it did wonders for my mental health.  I didn't want to go back home to my dysfunctional family (complete with an imminent divorce) and the shitty little town I grew up in, so I got a job working on campus that would let me stay in town with my new friends.  But on the second day of work, I had the most intense anxiety attack I've ever had.  I was locked in bend with my whole body periodically tensing up.  I also had suicidal thoughts for the second time of my life.  I couldn't get out of bed, so I just went into damage control and talked myself down and contacted my therapist.  Since she's based in my home town, we decided it would be better for me to return home and work on things face-to-face than put my wellbeing at risk.

Although my general anxiety level has been improving overall, I still have this weirdly acute anxiety around working a job.  It's hurt me in the past, but it was never this debilitating.  Now I'm stuck in a shitty living situation without the energy to get out of the house.  Pretty much everything I had in college that helped my anxiety and made me happy is gone now, since I don't really have friends here and the nature here is very sparse.  The only time I can relax and enjoy myself is when I smoke weed, which I know isn't a long-term solution.  Now I'm getting worried that my depression might show up again, and because of some borderline-traumatic experiences with my formerly depressed brother, that's just making my anxiety worse.  On top of that, I also have to work on papers, grad school applications, and next year's housing, so I just really don't know what to do with myself.  I'm doing better than I was the morning of that anxiety attack, and I know that my situation isn't permanent, but I just don't know how to feel happy here, or even just sorta okay. I had to leave a summer job in my college's town to live with my parents"
629,0,"Just wondering if anyone has experienced this. I am a 24 year old female and have had anxiety as long as I can remember. It’s gotten worse over the years and about two years ago I started to notice I was very sensitive to light, had a hard time focusing my eyes, and would see eye floaters constantly. I saw two different eye doctors and was told my eyes were perfectly healthy and floaters are harmless. The other symptoms were probably related to my migraines and the fact that I look at a computer all day every day for work. I even saw a neurologist and had a brain MRI and again was told I was completely healthy.

At this point I was frustrated but told myself I just had to deal with this and hoped it would go away on its own. My anxiety really peaked at this time and I started to go to therapy. I have been in therapy for one year now and have really come a long way. I feel like I am more in control now and that my overall anxiety level is better than it’s been since I was in high school. 

However, the eye floaters and other eye problems have not gone away. I am pretty convinced at this point that they are just another symptom of anxiety but I’m not sure how I can manage them. Has anyone had any luck with anxiety medication helping with anxiety eye symptoms? I wanted to try the therapy route before trying medication but now I am ready to try medication if it could help me with my eye issues.

Edit: spelling Anxiety causing eye floaters/light sensitivity?"
630,0,"It currently feels like my legs are full of energy and adrenaline but also very heavy at the same time. Also, it feels like parts of my leg are jumping and spawning sometimes when they’re only actually doing it part of the time. It feels like my feet are moving but they’re actually staying still.

I did just go through a flare up of anxiety and all. I’m up walking right now, pacing about to try and get my mind off of it. Gait is fine, legs feel a bit weak... assuming this is anxiety too? Weird leg feeling, can anyone relate?"
631,0,"All I can think about is this one carpet beetle larva I found and how the fuck I can get rid of the rest because, let’s face it, there is probably a lot more where that came from. 

I’ve never been bothered by bugs outside but once I see one in my house (besides rollie pollies or small spiders) I freak out and assume there are bugs all over my house; the most notably scary assumption is they’re in my room surrounding my bed. 

I have basically no money and can’t afford to hire an exterminator but I so wish I was just rich as fuck so I could hire someone to clean this house spotless or just move to a new house tbh. 

My anxiety isn’t limited to bugs - it’s basically everything, but specifically focused on my health, and the health of my 2 cats. They are literally my children and I would never want anything to hurt them; now myself, idk why I care so much about my health when I don’t even care about myself in general but that’s just my irrational anxiety (: 

Hoping I stop feeling so high strung and completely engulfed in my anxiety. I just can’t imagine ever gaining even an ounce of control over it. Can someone just give me some words of wisdom to get over this fret right now ; bugs"

Something is upsetting me and I spiral within seconds and get very angry and want to break or smash something, or punch somebody. I’m only asking becuase I’ve NEVER been like this before. I’ve always been the non violent person who will only ever use words as a weapon. It scares myself becuase it’s not like me to be violent, but I just get angry and escalate so fast. Does anyone else get this?? What sort of helped you?? Does anyone else get this thing... when they’re angry all the time?"

I'm tense constantly and restlessly. I think a lot more irrationally now. I worry about what might go wrong to the point I'm losing it. I can't help but think about it. I'm currently on vacation and I can't help but fear that something might happen to my pets at home. I'm worried that they could get sick, injured, or die. Even though we have a friend coming in to care for them and check on them, i still can't help but wonder..what if? It's literally only the first day of 11 and I'm already homesick as hell.

639,0,"Today I went to Starbucks, ordered my drink and with little hesitation asked for one of the lids without a straw. Now to some this may seem like an everyday thing but for me this was a big step. After that I went to my first ever lash lift appointment. I was so unbelievably excited to treat myself to this. I laid down, closed my eyes and the woman began my treatment. I knew from the beginning I had to keep my eyes closed for a good hour and a half but, I had no idea how I would react. Once she had the perm solution on and she took her hands away from my eyes to let it sit it all sank in. I immediately started to feel dizzy and like I needed to open my eyes IMMEDIATELY. Now, a few years ago I would have just sat there through my anxiety attack and just dealt with it because I didn’t want to bother her. Today, I very politely explained to her that I needed to have it taken off and I would still pay her for the service. She was so kind and understanding that she didn’t charge me for anything and told me I could always come back and try again another day. Again, to some people this would sound like a failure. I failed to complete the treatment and I felt so overwhelmed, embarrassed, and upset. But, I asked for a different lid today. And that’s a win in my book. I asked for a different lid today"
640,0,"So my boyfriend left on vacation yesterday. He and his friends went to college in a different state, and every year they participate in some sort of marathon thing, and then just hang out together for like a week. 

My boyfriend is usually a huge texter. He left yesterday morning, and being his usual self, sent me a bunch of texts/articles all throughout the day, and even emailed me on top of that. 

Then at about 8 pm, it completely stopped. He just totally stopped responding.

My boyfriend is actually usually the more anxious of us two when it comes to the relationship, but that might be because he gives me more constant reassurance than I usually give him, honestly. We’ve been living together for a year and have never been not available to one another via text. 

Before he left, he was acting extremely nice, Moreso than usual, and he even sort of “jokingly” kept mentioning that he was paranoid I’d cheat on him. I’ve never cheated and he has no reason to believe that. I think he kind of has low self esteem in general, but the fact that he said that was sort of strange and out of place and has sort of planted the opposite scenario in my mind: that he’s cheating.

He probably isn’t, I know. But I’ve had to shake off that intrusive thought all day. 

His college girlfriend, who he dated for years, lives in the city he’s visiting. I never gave it a second thought, I’ve never accused him of cheating or even suspected it, until this whole AWOL incident. 

It was so odd that he just immediately stopped communicating with me yesterday afternoon/evening, and then all throughout today; it’s now past midnight. I’ve texted and emailed him in case he lost his phone. No response.

Now, I’m paranoid that he’s in jail. Sounds a little ridiculous, but my boyfriend smokes weed socially on occasion, and what if he’s smoking it with his friends and got caught or something? I know people who have been jailed for this. 

And I know I mentioned it’s a marathon thing and I suppose he might be busy doing it, but he would have his phone- they make a lot of stops to take pictures and drink at bars, it’s not just straight running, its a complicated little tradition. And it’s been over 24 hours since he’s been completely, totally uncharacteristically, AWOL. 

Anyway, I know these are sort of ridiculous paranoias but i guess I’m just an anxious person. Gonna try to take a bath and take my mind off of something that’s probably nothing. Relationship anxiety"
641,0,"It kills me, every time I always assume there’s something going on underneath when even minor things happen and rn I’m freaking out, I feel sick to my stomach I’m a bit hungover I think but all I can think about is my boyfriend losing interest and I’m not sure if I did something wrong or if he’s just being a 17-year old boy. A week ago he was obsessed with me, wanted to see me, wanted to FaceTime every night, replied to my messages. We started dating following a hookup and after just one day he said “I love you” which kind of scared me but I really do think I love him, I have so many strong feelings for him even though we’ve been dating just like 2 weeks, I lost my virginity to him and I have so many feelings I haven’t felt in a long time, I think I’m going to cry in a minute I’m so overwhelmed. 

He left me on open on Snapchat which I assume is normal, but I can’t help but to think I did something wrong, he doesn’t like me anymore, I care so much about him and I’m not sure what to to not seem clingy. To be fair he was definitely the clingier one when things started heated up. He still says he wants to come over soon though, I just don’t know what to do 

It’s sending me into a thought loop. I’m so lonely right now, and now I used to have no friends but now I have lots of friends, I went to a party last night, I’ve been having fun the past several months for the first time in my life and have realized how much I actually love people. 

But I’ve lost friends in the past and I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong, I’m so scared I’ll never find love i feel kind of hurt and I hate that I hate how over analytical and emotional I am.

642,0,"Hi!

I've been stuck in a seemingly endless loop of stress and anxiety for two weeks now. On Sunday, I began getting pressure in the left side of my chest, up my neck a bit. I had a physical exam with my doctor on Monday, and she said that all of my physical symptoms were anxiety related and that nothing was wrong with my heart (as it should be in a 19 year old)

The pressure is still happening. Only once a day - sometimes not even that - but always conveniently at 2 AM (score).

Even though my doctor said I'm fine, it's still more than kind of freaking me out. Has anyone else experienced this symptom? Is there anything that I can do to make it stop? Chest Pressure?"

For the past two months ive been living in a different country (i dont know if it matters) and this past month almost every morning i wake up i get anxiety like my heart racing and finding hard to breath like something is in my lungs.

Another thing is that my grandma and mother both have depression and mostly my mother has anxiety and stress herself (maybe its in the genes? Honestly i have zero clue if somehow my mom having anxiety has to do anything with me).

Both upset me a lot, and now I have a wonderful boyfriend whom I adore, but I get so anxious about the smallest gestures of his that seem strange(they aren’t).

I can't help the fact that I have a hard time truly connecting with anyone especially when im meeting new people i don't know well in real life by myself without having friends to go with somewhere or meet up with. I'm way too socially anxious/awkward when I try go out alone, especially in super social situations. It sucks so much because these people just think I'm just hanging there or seem distant or reserved when I'm not. I never know what to say to get the ball rolling or can ever keep a conversation going and just end up doing small talk. I feel crazy. Like I'm going to be a social outcast for a long time and its very difficult to do this on my own. I try my best to be socially proficient but I get so discouraged at times when attempting to truly connect with another human being. The only thing that helps me to even talk to new people with ease and truly connect is with alcohol consumption and its a shame that its the only tool that gets me to clear my head of my worries/social issues.

I have been really into collecting records recently and I found out that there was a record store in the town he lives in, which really got me hyped to go see him and check out the store. I got up this morning and saw that there was a ""record store crawl"" event happening at the store this morning and decided that I wasn't going to go to the store due to it being super busy. Instead I went to a different record store in the opposite direction where the event was not taking place. When I got home I messaged my group of friends and and basically was like ""Hey I didn't come to out your way and went somewhere else because it was busy at that shop, but I got check out all the cool stuff I got"" My other buddy, rightfully so, called me out on not going to hang with my friend over getting records.  
  
The friend I didn't go to visit asks me quite often to come and hang out, but i always make some excuse. It's not that I don't want to see him. The issues is that when I do make a plan I get all anxious about it and think about every bad thing that could happen. What if my car breaks down? What if I start to feel sick to my stomach? what if he asks if I want to smoke weed and I fall back into my abusive/addictive ways with weed like I did in the past? What if I call to cancel the plans and I flake on him yet again? Will this be the last straw that breaks out friendship? What if I...etc. It's not like he has ever pressured me and he knows enough that I am trying to stay sober. I have a real nice time with him even if we are not faded. It's not just him I do this with either. The past year or so I really have just become like Stretch Armstrong and keeping everyone at arms length. The biggest thing I realized is this is exactly like what my Dad does/has done for years with my sister and I as well as his own family. If it's not beneficial to me then why bother. It sucks to be one the flip side of that and it feels so selfish and cold shoulderish. I don't like that. I am a very introverted person by nature and really like my alone time, but I also really get upset with myself and sometimes lonely when I do things like that. It also makes me overthink/worry like a motherfucker. I was never really like this when I was getting stoned all the time. I like being sober but I also feel like I was so much happier/carefree and social when I was using. I stopped because I realized that I was using to escape from my problems, but being sober hasn't really helped me figure them out much either. In fact it's made life and overthinking a bit harder.   
  
I did apologize to him (he probably didn't even see what I initially wrote yet). I really want to try to find some way to be less hermit like. I'm not looking for a complete 180  type of change. I know that's never going to be the case. I am who I am, but I would like to get back to at least being a person who has a bit of a life outside of work and my apartment. I am trying not to be so hard on myself as I am glad I was able to see that flaw and want to try to change it, but I do feel sort of shitty about what I said. I am probably doing the typical ProfessorDoctorMF overthinking I always do, but I am going to try to find a way to work on this a little bit.  
  
TL;DR: I was kind of a bad friend and unknowingly flaunted that fact. Got called out on it, and now I see how selfish I seem when my social anxiety hits. I want to try to change that a bit. I think I just realized how selfish I can be with my social anxiety."

Agreed to meet my partner at the fire station for a run and workout. We run and workout together because I love both however, I am scared to run alone and currently just too hot for my dog. The gym…well, I just can’t go alone.

On the drive, my chest started to tighten about halfway there. Thinking of the station in general. People I don’t know. Running. Working out. People I don’t know. A place I don’t know. Huge Men.

Sent a text I was on my way. I didn’t get a reply.

Arrived, parking in the front on the station. Sent text letting her know where I was parked with the reminder I was in the loaner car. No reply.

All the bay doors are open and trucks all there.

Text.

One of the crew members is working out.

Called. It goes to voice mail.

I should go in…but I just can’t. 

Text again.

Call our other partner. It goes to voice mail.

Text again.

It has been 20 minutes.

I get a call from a number I don’t recognize….it is the garage. My car is ready for pick up.

Now I have to go to the garage.

Guy still working out in the bay.

My throat… chest...kind of hard to breathe.

Text that I am going home.

I can’t breathe.

I’m stupid.

All I had to do was go in. All I had to do was go inside..."

652,0,"Does anyone obsess over the fear of losing people (and animals) that you love? And not knowing what will happen after you die? Not knowing if you'll ever see them again? And don't tell me there's no life after death because you can never KNOW.

I personally believe in a life after death. I believe we'll see our loved ones again. If I didn't believe this I would lose every bit of the sanity that I have. But since I can't know for sure I of course have doubts. What person with anxiety doesn't doubt?

These fears effect every aspect of my life. I'm constantly telling people that I love them... I want to make sure they know just in case.

This fear makes me very depressed. I lost someone I love dearly 4 years ago, the fear of never seeing him again destroys me. I think about him every day. Fear of losing loved ones &amp; what happens after we die."

656,0,"So I finally figured out who I want to be and what I want to do and it terrifies me. I want to be that person more than anything right now but I am so scared. What if I find out that I can't be that person? I know I wont know until I try but I am struggling to convince myself that. My brain just says 'no, that's too scary.' I know it won't be easy and it will be stressful. The person I want to be is the complete opposite of current me. It seems so much better but stressful. I can't handle much stress so I am worried. Or what if I mess up and I can't do what I want? I hate how much my anxiety controls me.

So what do you do when you struggle to get yourself to do something big? Or how do you convince yourself or force yourself to believe or do something?

Sorry if it seems so messy. I just typed what came to mind at that second. How do you convince yourself to believe or do something?"

658,0,"I've never posted before so here goes nothing: I just recently got married and returned from our honeymoon. It was a 7 day cruise and it was awesome, we've never cruised before and I was relieved to not experience any motion sickness or general weirdness while on board 

For whatever reason, the morning when we finally docked (exactly 2 weeks ago) I had one of the most intense panic attacks ever as soon as I woke up. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 6, so after almost 20 years of managing my anxiety I was surprised at how severe it was. I really thought I was going to die. I was shaking, my thoughts were racing, I was extremely warm, and it finally calmed down a little after waking my husband up. I was thinking it was likely because we had been moving for so long that being still weirded me out, however we had docked and gotten off the boat a couple of times over that 7 day period so I couldn't be sure. 

Fast forward to a few hours later; we got off the boat and even did a tour/airboat ride through the Everglades in Florida. Things had been going well and we had a late night flight home, so we expected a fairly long day at the airport. It ended up getting delayed until the next morning, and the panic attacks were nonstop from about 1:00PM to 1:00AM. I was dizzy as hell, and scared myself so bad thinking it was a medical emergency because I really wasn't sure what was going on. I was worried I wouldn't be able to get on the plane and survive the flight, but I did. My husband was willing to sleep at the airport but they were giving out hotel vouchers, and I told him if we didn't get out of the airport I wouldn't be able to stop the panic. We got to the hotel, I slept a few hours, and got home with no delays. 

Basically the whole first week we were home, I was still suffering from extremely bad panic attacks. Last Thursday I had my husband take me to urgent care, the whole time telling myself that if I'm unable to be seen that I'm going to die. I was shaking so violently and unable to describe my symtoms very well, which made the anxiety worse. The doctor was extremely reassuring and told me it wasn't any of the horrible things that I thought it might be (a stroke, seizure, mal de debarqument, etc). 

This past week has been much better but I have noticed it tends to creep up on me out of nowhere, especially at night. The dizziness that was triggering the attacks has gone away for the most part but I still catch my heart rate elevating, and my mind starts to race. I honestly feel like the panic attacks I experienced at the airport completely destroyed my coping mechanisms and that my brain is struggling to recover. I've never panicked for such a long period of time, and this is coming from someone who has experienced a lot due to my anxiety in general throughout my life.

Basically anything that I accomplish is significant to me at this point, like going out to dinner or going shopping. 

I guess what I'm looking for are people who have had similar experiences, any coping tips, anything related to anxiety at night...the one thing that seems to help the most is breathing in for 5 seconds, then breathing out for another 5 seconds.

I've been taking Zoloft for years now, and my anxiety has been under control for the most part until 2 weeks ago. Since then I've also been taking hydroxyzine but my body is getting used to it now and it hasn't been as helpful as it was at first. I've been to therapy and learned about a lot of coping mechanisms. I'm thinking it's time to go back to therapy, and I'm also considering something like Xanax for when the panic really sets in but I don't want to take more medication or take a chance with getting addicted to something. 

It's completely irrational but feels so real, especially with physical symptoms, and I think that's what makes anxiety such a difficult thing. 

tldr: I've had anxiety all my life but a long panic attack triggered me to the point where I haven't had a day without a panic attack since. The recovery process has been slow and I am looking for tips on how to feel like ""myself"" again. Finally recovering (I think?)"

661,0," I thought I had these things under control, the last 2 months I was getting the best sleep of my life. Only minor twitches here and there. Now out of nowhere it seems they are back. Just as I am falling asleep my body jolts or jerks really hard and I'm wide awake again. It feels like getting shot with adrenaline. And then my anxiety skyrockets as I start thinking I won't get any sleep that night. I try to calm the mind and then go back to bed, start drifting off asleep and then boom it happens again. I tried my breathing exercises, nothing. Finally I've had to use the only thing that has worked in the past, downing a bunch of ativan. I then can sleep. I don't know what is going on, not much has changed in my life since they were gone. But once they started (last 3 nights), its all I can think about during the day. And then when I get into bed my anxiety flares up because I'm wondering if i'm going to have another episode. My hypnic jerks have returned out of nowhere resulting in insomnia and anxiety"

I have asked my project supervisor for help but nothing he suggests is working. I have a meeting with him on Monday and I have emailed my student advisor who isn't here until Tuesday.
I don't think I can do it in the time. I'm considering withdrawing from my course but I am scared of fees I'll have to pay back and having no references from the last year to do anything.

665,0,"21f- When I first sought out treatment for my anxiety, I was put on zoloft 50mg. Wasn’t noticing any difference, so my doc put me on 100mg and added 10mg buspar day and night. After that I begun to feel relief from my anxiety and having way less panic attacks. But I started to feel mood swings and very depressed certain days, which I never had many depression-like symptoms before. My doc upped me to 150mg zoloft. I also have to take a sleeping med so I can try to at least get some sleep. At this point, I feel so emotionally numb, like I can’t get excited for anything anymore. I feel so dull and boring. But, it’s better than being anxious every day. Is there a middle ground that exists? I talked to my doc and he wanted to increase zoloft to 200, but I wanted to scale back instead of keep upping. I would love to have my emotions back and be able to enjoy life more. Does anyone have any advice or experience with these meds? thank you all- sending hugs Zoloft, buspar, lamictal, etc.. help!?"

I have this feeling in my stomach (the very middle) that feels like I’m just getting poked inside of me. The worse the anxiety is,the worse the pain is and vice versa. It gets to the point where I throw up almost every time I have a panic attack now. I’m also always pacing back and forth throughout my house talking to my dad about what I’m feeling because he dosent struggle with panic attacks. When I’m in these states my mind thinks about every possible outcome, which is horrible because I have adhd. And the more I think, the worse it gets. For example I took some alprozolam the other day while having a panic attack and then proceeded to throw it up 5-10minutes later because of my irrational thoughts of what if. I really need help right now and if anyone has experienced the same let me know.✌🏻 Help me"

669,0,"First time poster on this sub. 

Has anyone had this problem? I've had friends and families give me this kind of talk where they think they're sounding encouraging by telling me ""See?! I told you you're having fun!"" As if I'm still a child being a pouty little brat that doesn't want to accept that i am indeed having fun.

Here's an example: 

A few years ago i went to a free concert with my roommates at the time. I wasn't sure if i wanted to go because i don't enjoy tight crowds and people forcing their way to stand in front of me. When i told my roomies about this problem, one of them said to not let it go to my head and i should just have fun. Well, i went with them, and i was having fun... until my roommate turned to me and said ""See? I told you you're having fun!""

My smile immediately went away and i left the concert by myself during the intervention. 

Like jesus fucking christ, why do people think it's okay to draw attention to me having fun as if they're trying to win an argument or something? It makes me think other people are watching me enjoy myself and then i feel self conscious about it. 

Even though that was years ago, i still think that feeling will happen if i try to enjoy myself. This summer is moving by real fast, and I want to go hiking and take pictures again, since i haven't been active on my Instagram in like 6 months (Photography is one of my favorite things). But because i haven't uploaded in a while, I'm scared of someone commenting on a new pic i might upload and say those ""encouraging"" words that they think will help me, but really it'll just make me hide in my room again.

Am i just being really petty, or is this a problem a lot if other people deal with? I want to do things that make me happy but I'm afraid of someone telling me ""I told you so!"""

671,0,"First of all I already know some of you make thing this is a silly or stupid thing to be asking advice about but know that this is a serious issue that has been going on for about 3 weeks now. So it all started with overdoing it on eating an edible about 3 week ago. I took a 30 mg edible which by the way I hardly smoke so it’s very rare. Anyways since I took more than I was supposed to eat I obviously had a really bad trip. Non stop panic attacks and feeling like I was going to die. A week later my panic attacks were still there. Some of the symptoms that I was experience while on the edible I was still experiences but just in more mild way such as slurred speech, being insecure of what I’m saying, feeling like I’m not present, slightly dry mouth, over sensitive of my tongue. For example when I was having my bad trip my whole attention was on my tongue not feeling normal so I feel like I pay a lot of attention to it while I’m talking and it’s frustrating. I’m not saying the marijuana caused all these symptoms but I feel like my anxiety is causing me to think I still have them. But what i want to know is of anyone has ever experienced this before. BTW I’ve had anxiety most of my life but never this bad to a point where it’s making me despeessed. Do you think I will ever feel like my old self.

675,0,"in spring of 2018 I was in an emotionally abusive relationship, lost 15 pounds in a month, was throwing up nightly and having panic attacks daily and had ideation of suicide. I was not myself and had lost my mind for a while. then I started Effexor (75mg) which saved me. my symptoms became easier to deal with. i started therapy at the same time and after getting rid of the toxic abusive relationship, I was finally myself with NO symptoms at ALL. 

now, almost a year later I am in a perfectly healthy relationship with my dream guy, but recently my s/o left for vacation, and the night before I noticed my symptoms coming back. we had a small misunderstanding and all of a sudden my anxiety hit me hard and I was worrying and getting upset over small things (I notice most of it is worrying that I am going to lose him or push him away somehow like I have with my past two boyfriends because of my anxiety, or that if we had a crappy night the day before he left, he would cheat on me or something when he went away. what usually what happens is I panic if everything’s not “perfect” when I get bad).

ever since he left I had been having anxiety. then when I express it to him, he is so sweet, but it makes me freak out that I am pushing him away because I don’t want him to think my anxiety is annoying. it’s a cycle. I would bring up shit like me comparing myself to other girls or that he’s having too much fun to care about me. and if he isn’t super nice or lovey I overthink it and worry something is wrong.

so tonight I felt super sick bc of it and started to throw up and felt extremely nauseous because of how much i’m scared i’ve fucked up. even when i text him to apologize i feel like it’s just making it worse bc it’s not moving on from me, and i don’t wanna be like this.

676,0,"I made this account purely to get some advice.My boyfriend was diagnosed with severe generalized anxiety, social anxiety and Aspergers. We are both in the same Masters program (we have a six year age gap - if that matters) and we met 8 months ago. I feel a lot of pressure and have developed some anxiety myself since I've been in this relationship. I do feel like I'd be an asshole if I left him because of his anxiety too. I really really need advice. Below I've outlined the ways in which his anxiety affects me:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Since we are in academia at a competitive program we have a lot of assignments as well as side projects and work. Before every deadline, he has a massive breakdown and I need to basically do all of his assignment because he says he just cannot. Moreover, he keeps asking for validation that he's not stupid (which he isn't) and that I still respect him - WHILE I do his work along with mine. It doesn't help that I also need to keep reassuring him that it will work out - as he keeps telling me I won't be able to finish both assignments. Sometimes he reads over my work while I'm still working on it and starts panicking about something he doesn't understand (understandably since he hasn't done the research I did) and I need leave everything I'm doing and sit down and explain it to him.

&amp;#x200B;

2) He wants me to apply next year since he wants me to focus on helping him apply this year. He thinks I'm too young to be in a PhD program and said that if he doesn't get in this year he will kill himself. He also made it clear that he does not want to compete with me during applications and I should wait.

&amp;#x200B;

3) When I ask him to get therapy he says he can only work with a strong alpha male therapist which he is unable to find. Further, he says he's always afraid that people will hate him and leave him because of his anxiety and that he feels broken and I feel guilty for even bringing it up.

&amp;#x200B;

4) When I tried to get therapy he freaked out when he found out that I spoke to my therapist about him and said I wasn't allowed to do that because he knew they would ask me to leave him. I'm further not allowed to talk to my friends about this or journal about it or even look anything up since he checks my history. I made a new account for this and will have to delete my history after I post this.

&amp;#x200B;

5) My self esteem is close to 0 because every time I achieve something, he feels bad that he did not achieve it and I basically have to downplay my victories when sharing it with him. I also see him flirting with other girls but he blames it on Aspergers and social anxiety and says he doesn't understand social cues. But on the other hand - he said I wasn't allowed to hang out with guys since his anxiety makes him feel like his body is on fire.

&amp;#x200B;

6) I have tried to break up before - each time it ended in his screaming, banging his head on the wall, crying unconsolably and basically self destructing. I know this is technically not my responsibility but he does all this in front of me in the same room or bangs loudly on my door and hits his head against my door while screaming.

&amp;#x200B;

We are going to be living together for another year before the lease ends. While I write this, I can see all the red flags in this relationship. I do not know what to do. I don't think breaking up is an option because I don't want him to kill himself and I know without me he isn't capable of doing his PhD applications himself. On the other hand everyday interactions with him are draining and make me feel suffocated and paralyzed and I've been depressed for months now with occasional suicidal ideation. I'm sorry if my writing isn't coherent, I'm really stressed and having difficulty articulating it. All in all I do know that he feels guilty and isn't doing this on purpose or being manipulative. He just has these awful coping strategies. BF has GAD and Aspergers"

678,0,I usually don’t struggle with anxiety if I have my tools to help (exercise mainly) but since I started my new master’s program it’s been a real struggle. It’s very rigorous so it doesn’t allow my time to exercise and relieve stress. I’m a bit older than the other students (32 in a group average of 22ish) so I haven’t found a “clique” yet and feel pretty socially isolated. I’m pretty much constantly anxious and have insomnia. It’s been about 4 days in the program and I already want to withdraw. I’m almost sure it’s the right choice to leave. I felt happier at my old job and closer to my family and friends at home. Considering that other people have way worse experiences than me I am grateful it’s not that bad. But I still wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone. Anxious in college
679,0,"Night sweats

I'm talking sheet soaking, hair matted, need to towel off sweating.

Been under a lot of emotional stress lately and the anxiety is ever present, just in varying degrees. When I finally fall asleep (can sometimes take a while!) I'll be good for an hour or two, but then awake just profusely drenched.

It's then hard to get comfortable again because the sheets and pillows are so wet. I don't wake my partner to ask if we can change them. She needs her sleep too.

I don't associate any nightmares or dreams to these episodes. I rarely remember my dreams, unlike my partner.

But what causes this, and what can be done about this? Any insights or other experience with this is appreciated. Does anyone else experience this, and what do you do about it?"
680,0,"So first off, I’d like to state that I am taking medication for my anxiety and it helps reduce that constant tension/anxious feeling, but obviously it doesn’t fix the things that go through your mind all the time. I’m also seeing a therapist for this. 

But I was wondering how other people deal with their paranoid thoughts/obsessive thoughts? For example, I’ll be eating a banana I got from the store and think “wow, how clean is this banana? What if an outbreak breaks out from the food that we buy at the store? What if the food we’re eating is slowly killing us? Should I do more research into what I’m eating and where I buy my food?” and then this continues to spiral more and more until I end up somewhere completely weird and scary and irrational 

Like, is there a point where I just have to tell myself, “so what?” Or am I supposed to correct my thoughts? Idk if I’m making any sense, it’s really hard to explain I guess but they really scare me and it bothers me. I do my best to rationalize, but the thing about anxiety is that that’s the PROBLEM, you CANT rationalize properly UGHHH 

TL;DR: advice on anxious/paranoid thoughts that just won’t stop? Anxiety/paranoid thoughts"
681,0,"My anxiety has been horrible the past month, I've only been this bad once before. I hurt a friend (unintentionally) and it's been eating away at me. The anxiety-related symptoms, overthinking, guilt and worry have been too much to handle. The anxiety and self-hatred built up and then someone contacted me the other night pretending to be this person, got my hopes up and made a fool of me. It pushed me over the edge. I sat there with a bottle of alcohol and a handful of trazadone, I was ready to end everything. The one thing that stopped me being that if the person I hurt ever found out that I'd killed myself, I wouldn't have wanted her to feel like it was her fault, because that would have been a horrible thing to live with and my mental health is not her fault anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that I have a dad who practically hates me too. The constant anxiety and has really taken its toll on my health; I've fainted twice, I feel so stressed and low, my OCD traits are returning, I've dropped a tonne of weight, my chest feels funny. I finally felt wanted and it was so nice. I had to go and fucking mess it up. As someone who has never had anyone show them any interest and always been made to feel a freak, it felt so good to have someone interested in me for once. I spent my late teenage years being so isolated and I still am, I've had to deal with blackmail, harassment and that shit is still following me to this day. I've had my name dragged through the dirt for years by a stalker and as a result people's judgement of me really concerns me. Its so horrible having to worry that people judge me on made up lies about me and this causes me so much anxiety and worries me that it is part of the reason why she ended things. I don't want to live like this any more, worrying that my whole life is dictated by stuff I haven't even done by some obsessed schizophrenic cunt, it's not fair and I'm fucking fed up. It's not life, when you're always worrying.

&amp;#x200B;

I was terrified of losing her and came on too strong because of that. With this person it felt like I had found the Malaria to my Grim (from Grim Adventures). She made me happy, even when just friends and we had a lot in common. For most people, loosing a close friend would probably be trivial but for me it was quite a big deal, especially a friend that liked me in more than just friends way. It felt so nice having someone who was interested and wanted to talk everyday. I just feel so alone, I don't make friends very easily and I opened myself up to this person, which is something I don't usually do. We were really close and the way she ended things didn't give me any closure, just anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a bad person, I just made an awful mistake. I didn't think. And as a result of my anxiety, I've done some things I'm not proud of this past month. I've come to accept the fact that she hates my guts. And I'm letting go because I don't want to cause her any further pain. I really cared about her and can't forgive myself for it. I thought she was great. I'm so fucking lost and I hate myself so much. If its not one thing I'm worrying about, then its another. I just want to be happy for once.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not good at sitting with uncertainty and worry that I upset someone I cared about. I'd never have done anything to hurt her intentionally, but I hate myself for what I did. I'd love the speak to her again, but I know she won't forgive me. The anxiety has been hell the past month and I don't know what to do. I'm so ashamed of myself that I've let my mental health deteriorate like this. I'm always going to be fucked in the head, I just want to feel normal for once. I hate being like this :( I'm a pathetic mess, my anxiety has gotten too much and I nearly killed myself the other night"
682,0,"It was good but bad at the same time. Met some nice people but there were literal pieces of shit there too, since my head in half a 3/4 a centimetre in height this guy straight up called me a nazi and I wanted to punch him which put me into a negative mood, and since I’m an anxious I tend to be careful around people I’m new with and I only knew one person out of 50 in this party, and few people avoided me, when I tried to make conversation which pissed me off also after that only the good people stayed and I enjoyed myself until this guy we kinda clicked was taking me home but on the way we stayed at his house and he legit was paranoid and anxious af he kept saying negative shit one after another like “you’re just trying to be nice” “i bet you’re this” “I bet you’re that”. Which made me a little uncomfortable and annoyed. Now I’m sitting at home with the worst mood ever that party kinda changed me a bit tbh Went to a party for the first time in a while (rant)"
683,0,"Hi everyone. Yesterday, I had a mental breakdown after work. I am a people’s pleaser and yesterday I failed to do just that. A lot of people rely on me to be the moral booster. To be a upbeat and positive guy that can do it all! Deep down I’m not. I’m actually really sad and what not.

I called my fiancée and just broke down. She cheered me up by talking to me and later taking us to watch Toy Story 4. I felt better, but not honestly okay.

I plan to take Monday-Wednesday off, Thursday is an American holiday. I’ll return on Friday. I need to relax and cope with my real feelings. 

Thank you for listening. I had a mental breakdown. I’m planning to call in sick."
684,0,"I usually only have panic attacks right before and during my period.  Now my period is over, and I'm having over 10x as many per day as I have been having in an entire month.  Last night I had over a dozen in my sleep...  I haven't had them in my sleep in almost a year.  I'm also throwing up during about half of them again, which hadn't happened in about a year as well.  It's really throwing me off because it seems like it came out of nowhere.  It's making me really depressed and I've started SHing again. My worst anxiety relapse after my biggest and longest recovery. I feel like I'm losing my mind..."
685,0,"I grew up fairly poor. My family was kind of hoarder status and our house was always in disrepair. I worked hard in highschool and got a grant for college, but this was also when I became super depressed and eventually super anxious. 

After college I landed a job in tech, but while I was making decent money I was still ridiculously depressed and suicidal. I lived on my own and didn't really interact with anyone or have a social life. Then I met my bf online and moved to live with him. I was even more depressed at this point due to moving far away.

Then I started taking CBD daily and it helped my depression a lot. Now I feel like a normal person, have a boyfriend, live in a nice house, and just bought a new car. I want to be excited about all these things but something in my brain keeps telling me that because things are finally going good they will have to ultimately come crashing down. I just expect it to happen in the near future. Does anyone else struggle with this? My boyfriend doesn't understand what I'm talking about. Does anyone else ever feel like their life is too good so it's going to all come crumbling down?"
686,0,"I always have brain fog to one degree or another. It’s part of my chronic anxiety. But when it’s at its worst, there’s an added kind of “layer” to the fog, like I can feel it almost physically in my head, that blocks me from my connection to my usual appetites (literally, I have no appetite for food), interests or emotions. It’s fucking torture to be honest. 

Something as subtle but profound as the usual spark of good feeling I get from seeing my cat, gone. It’s like you’re disconnected from feelings you just took for granted or were even aware of before you were blocked from them, if that makes any sense. Like there’s an actually *physical* block in my head. It’s fucked up.

Is this anhedonia? Depression? Both? Maybe it doesn’t matter. Has anyone else experienced this? Because honestly, it makes me feel like a freak. Thanks. Is this “anhedonia?”"

689,0,Random post but I have some anxiety issues worrying about like natural and human disasters happening.

690,0," So, I don't even know if anyone is going to read this but here it goes. It's warm here so my friends are planning to go to the swimming pool in town together to cool off. The problem is as obviously I'm writing here I have social anxiety and I really don't want my friends to see my shirtless/etc. I just find it really weird and couldn't deal with it. But the problem is I also have a very severe Fear of Missing Out and the idea that all of them will be having fun at the pool without me really makes me feel very anxious and almost sick. Now the bad part is, my parents have some Ativan in their drawers, and when they go, I feel like I have no choice but to take it, because for the entire time that my friends are there I will not be able to be calm without it (even with it it will be bad). I don't know what else to do, but I hate imagining how all of them are having fun, talking and how I'd be missing out on it. Friends going somewhere without me what to do"
691,0,"Started taking due to anxiety &amp; pressures of grad school. I had a continuous feeling of weight on my chest that I thought was either asthma or something heart related. FEV tests for asthma were normal and 2 EKGs and a stress test found my heart was normal too. Was put on sertraline 25mg a day for 2 weeks then upped to 50mg a day, been on 50 a day since.

First 2 months were the hardest. A few bouts of nausea/dry heaving, and days where I found myself crying for no reason, like for an existential crisis. A couple days where I felt like a zombie at work and had no emotional feeling.

Stuck with it and I'm so relieved to have done it. That previous summer didnt feel like a ""break"" because of my symptoms and dealing with the first weeks of the med. This summer I could actually relax and enjoy myself. It's much more manageable, still have a little mental fog and anxiety here and there but its better to deal with and I havent felt the chest tightness for months. Only side effect now is strangely I need to pee more often... but I'll take it!

Posting because this is something I would have liked to read a year ago.

Stick with it! 1 year in on sertraline!"
692,0,"I feel like that's a common situation, right? Because you have anxiety you don't want to call or anything and you don't want to talk to people in person. So, you aren't able to get medicine you need and you can't get treatment. You feel like nobody's going to take you seriously. I've diagnosed with GAD and depression. and I don't have medicine for either of those, they've tried a bunch of stuff on me before but I was under my parents care so if anything went wrong I could just ask them to come in. I didn't have to make appointments, I didn't have to seek out the doctor. But now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. If anyone wants to help I have CareSource insurance and live in Ohio. The first problem is I just can't find anybody that's like close to me and then like when I do I call and nobody answers or I get too scared and I just hang up. I just don't know what to do So like... What if you need medicine but you're too scared to call or say anything"
693,0,"I have obsessive type thoughts but they aren’t fixed and shift through the day as new things happen, it seems most people with OCD have the things or trigger that upset them and their rituals, I don’t have any rituals and it is always typically something new like I will obsess that I got lice in my hair from a hat I tried on at the store, and then on my way home be in five lane traffic and obsess that if i’m in the middle lane and I faint I will die, and then when I get home worry there is something on my clothes, it is never fixed nor do I have compulsions, and I know that there is pure O OCD but i’m just not sure if I have that. the only thing I have in common with OCD is that my thoughts can sometimes be things I know are probably not true but I think them anyways i.e the lice thing or the fainting in the highway Do I have severe anxiety or OCD?"
694,0,"I have had social anxiety for some time now, I try to overcome it with baby steps and I've got a lot better over the last few years. However, I have spent so much time obsessing over this anxiety and other traumas that I didn't 'learn'/forgot how to have fun. Since I was 13 I spent my time on drugs, drinking and fake socializing (this means just getting wasted and not forming real connections with anyone). 

I got completely sober last year and started noticing that little by little I'm gaining self confidence and a feeling of self worth. I don't have a lot of trouble talking one on one with someone but when it comes to group settings, that's where the anxiety and depressing thoughts really kick in. Idk why exactly, but I just freeze, can't talk and start feeling very isolated. I think It's because I start noticing how much genuine fun these people are having and it took me so long just to come to the point to talk to someone. I get the feeling that I'm never going to be able to talk like them, and I just start comparing myself to them. Which gives me a feeling that all my proces is not worth anything. I don't know how to have fun"
695,0,"I'm 16F and my anixety has worsened over the past few months.  It didn't affect me physically to the extent that it does now. I spiral at the littlest of inconveniences but I've never had to deal with a trigger that was so damn inescapable, that I couldn't even step away from. My parents have always fought a lot and it was kinda annoying but I was desensitized to it for the most of my life so it didn't affect me much. 

However, this changed a few months ago when they had the biggest and most serious fight I've ever witnessed. I was fully convinced that they would both murder each other or hurt their own selves. I had the worst anxiety attack that day. I seriously felt my life flashing before my eyes, the floor was spinning and I felt like my legs were empty, like they would give away and I would collapse. I was feeling so light-headed and I felt like my heart was going to burst out of my ribcage. I actually had to run away to calm down. I collapsed in the elevator and it took me about five minutes to feel even remotely stable again. It felt like I was having a heart attack. I felt nauseous and completely drained even hours after it was over. It was so hard for me to calm down, I felt on edge the whole day and kept losing it at the slightest hints that it would happen again.

It's not much better now. I've never had as frequent anxiety attacks as I do now. They used to be very rare and only in the face of extreme triggers. Now, I have them nearly everyday, especially on weekends when my dad is home and my mom and dad have to spend more time together. 

We're not doing the best financially so my entire family kind of shares a single room. The only privacy I have is in the bathroom or the balcony.

I lose it every time they have the slightest disagreement or argument because I keep fearing that it will escalate to the level that it did that day. Them yelling, which is very often, is enough to give me a full blown anxiety attack followed by a ton of bathroom trips because it's even messing with my digestive system now.

I often try to mediate but it's so damn hard when it feels like I'm going to faint. I'm not the best at maintaining a poker face so they've started noticing how much it affects me. They try not to fight as much as they used to but it's unavoidable because they can't get along. 

When it happens, I can't even leave the situation and am forced to stay in the room because my dad thinks I'm losing my mind and if I keep this up, do I plan on running away from every conflict in my life? So breathing exercises and distractions are kind of useless when you can't even remove yourself from the trigger.

I don't have access to therapy. Mental illnesses are very stigmatized around here, my dad genuinely believes that it's a conspiracy by the medical industry so psychologists can exploit the insecurities of their clients and hook them to drugs. He thinks they fricking plant mental illnesses into people's heads. I've tried challenging that but both of my parents lose their temper at the mere suggestion that something may be wrong with me. They're aware of the physical symptoms as well but they think it's all in my head and I'll be okay once I stop overreacting. (Which technically is true but how to not overreact is the damn problem which they don't understand)

I'm trying to get a summer job or internship so I have to spend less time at home but I really need some sort of coping mechanism. I'm tired of feeling this so damn often. My parents already have so much on their plate, I don't want to add to that. I just want to become desensitized to this again but I just don't know how. I feel so weak and helpless. I just don't know how to deal with this. How to cope when the trigger is inescapable?"

I’ve built my collection up my entire life and have about 1000 books at the moment plus about 400 ebooks.  Books are my escape, my distraction, my safe space. Every one of my books is special to me and takes me to a different world where I don’t have anxiety and don’t need to worry all the time.

I have no problems getting rid of surplus clothes, jigsaws, games, dvds etc but I just can’t get rid of any books. A lot of my favourites I have duplicated on ebook but an ebook is nowhere near as good as holding the book in my hands and feeling the pages as I read or enjoying the musty book scent.

Before we broke up, I went to the doctor and got prescribed Venlafaxine to take everyday, and Clonazepam to take on an as needed basis when anxiety attacks hit. I immediately got scared, as did my parents because when I researched into the meds, I saw a lot of bad side effects and people having issues with dependency and getting off of them. _I’m not scared of taking a pill every morning for the rest of my life, I’m scared of the pill not working anymore and having to up the dosage to an unhealthy point, because if I stop taking it the problems return._

I wanted to go to therapy first and then consider medication so that I could learn to deal with anxiety first instead of covering it up with pills. 

A friend of mine recently started meds and he recommends them, and I want to listen to him and get them, but a big concern is price too - they’re expensive.

My main issues in the end are the side effects, the fact that I may never get off them because my body may become dependent on them, which scares me for the future, and the price (this is a more minor concern, as my health has no price).

Any advice? Thank you. Reluctant to taking medication"

I had a bit of a long day and when I got home, I suddenly felt a little out of it. It quickly got a lot worse and I literally felt like I was on some sort of hallucinogenic. My vision got hazy and tunnel-y and my breathing became very choppy.

I feel better now, but I’m realizing I should go back to seeing my therapist. She helps a ton and, for a good while, I felt like I had control over my anxiety. I’m realizing that it has sort of “come back” and left me in a pretty cloudy mental state the last month or so. I know I’m going to be okay, but it’s definitely scary to feel something like this slowly make its way out from the back of my head.

709,0,"My dad started talking to me about at least exercising for 45 minutes a day, and I already felt like shit because that means I’m being a fat and lazy piece of shit, but now he notices too and thinks I’m being useless. 

We started to argue, but I was just frustrated that I couldn’t tell him what he wanted me to. I couldn’t answer his questions, and if I did he just kept prying deeper and deeper. 

Well why do you think you’re improving? 
I’m focusing on eating better and being kinder to myself. 
Well how are you doing that? 
.....I don’t know.... I’m just.... cooking two meals a day and-
Well go to the library and read books about it. 

I felt like he was telling my I have to be constantly challenging myself. 
It went on like this for a couple of minutes until I shutdown, and just stoped responding. Occasionally I would say something and then regret it. He just wouldn’t go. 

I told him I wanted to stop talking and he said I couldn’t run away from everything. I tried not to and I tried to end the conversation for what felt like hours. By this point I was crying, and I had that lump in my throat. So I just got up and went to the bathroom and had a small crying session curled up on the toilet. 

I was waiting and hoping he would leave while I was in the bathroom but he didn’t. 

He asked me to come out of the bathroom and finish the conversation, then I told him i was overwhelmed and needed to be left alone. 

But he didn’t leave me alone. He sat outside of the door and kept arguing with me.

At this point I was kind of sobbing, my eyes were puffy and I couldn’t breath right. 

It was difficult for me to think, everything was just so threatened in my head. At this point, it was hard to actually listen to him and respond. Talking was so hard, so I just sat there and tried to distract myself. 

After I stopped responding he would knock on the door, louder and louder. I was afraid he would break the door open and continue to argue face to face. 

So I went out, and good lord it didn’t end. It was a full hour of my curling into myself and crying and sobbing and gasping for air and hyperventilating.  I kept on telling him I want to be left alone. That I felt overwhelmed, and he just said that I can’t run away, and we need to figure out how to communicate.

At this point in time I was so panicked I was shaking and couldn’t breath and my lips and eyes were swollen and I honestly just wanted it to end. I kept on thinking when will it stop. 

Then after what seemed like hours he said he would give me a few minutes, and then we’d talk later. 

I then moved into the corner of my room, wedged between a coffee table. 

When he came back he hugged me, and I hated it. I didn’t want to be touched at all. It felt like I was being smothered, I couldn’t breath. But I couldn’t tell him not to touch me because I know he’s upset because he cares for me and just wants to help me. So I sat there, just silently crying. I managed to stop hyperventilating so he would leave me alone. 

And now, 30 minutes after, I have made a mini fort with my dresser and mattress. I am in a tiny square with pillows, blankets, drawing stuff and some water. Currently I never want to leave this tiny square, and if someone talks to me, especially if they ask me a question, I’ll begin to violently sob.  

This is the most shaken, scared and panicked I’ve ever been in my entire life. All because my dad wanted me to go to the gym 45 minutes a day, which is a reasonable request. 

Now I feel like all the progress I made with eating and mental health is just down the shitter. Back to just telling people what they want to hear, and starving myself so I can be less anxious. So overwhelmed."
710,0,I've been studying for my exam for grad school entry for about 2 months now and the anxiety and pressure leading up to me is suffocating. I only have 2 weeks left and I'm not sure if I'm ready and a lot of weight is on it. I constantly feel like i'm not doing enough and I feel so guilty when I don't study. I've shut myself away from my family and friends and my partner doesn't have much to say except that I need to seek professional help. I've had the darkest thoughts in these past 2 months that have really made me doubt my worth and ability to succeed in graduate school. 2 weeks until my exam for grad school entry and the anxiety is killing me..
711,0,"So, 

&amp;#x200B;

To cut to the point, I already have GAD. Had to pause college by a year to go off and deal with it (about 4 years ago). Found CBT very helpful, went back to college, joined a professional graduate programme and haven't been bothered by it since. Great success.

&amp;#x200B;

Skin hasn't been so successful - I've tried everything but it just won't go. Went to my GP who referred me to a consultant dermatologist. He believes roaccutane is inevitable, and tbh so do I. Nothing else has cleared it despite over 15 years of trying. The pill, antibiotics, they work initially and then as soon as I stop, acne comes back.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I think most people know the reputation Roaccutane has. I would love to hear the experiences of people who have gone on it with a preexisting anxiety disorder. I'm finding it difficult to find those experiences recounted online, as mostly any searches are just coming up with people saying it caused their anxiety or depression. TIA Already have GAD - Roaccutane/Accutane?"
712,0,"I experienced something traumatic tonight with my parents fighting and me trying to stop them from hitting each other. 

I had a panic attack at one point a few hours ago and was gasping for breath.

My heart rate is 178 a few hours later. I've been in my room trying to relax and do some breathing but it doesn't seem to help my heart rate go down even though I'm fairly calm now, apart from worrying that my heart rate is too high.

Problems I’ve observed from this cycle: creating imagined scenarios or assuming people’s thoughts/motives, avoiding confrontation, getting caught in a cycle instead of progressing, reacting inappropriately, hurting others, hurting yourself, etc... the list goes on!

715,0,"I’ve been growing my hair out for a little over a year and a half now, and as a guy with shoulder length hair I’d say it’s pretty long. My friends are used to my long hair, I’m used to my long hair, but I’m tired of having long hair. The reason I’ve waited this long To cut it though, is because it’s now so long that if I got it cut short like I want it, everyone is going to comment on it. It’s not that I think it’ll be mean, I know they’ll all support it, but I hate it when people comment on changes in my appearance. The “oh you got a haircut” or “where’d all your hair go?” Comments make me really irritated, and I know they’re gonna happen, I know everyone is gonna comment that I’ve changed my hair and I don’t want that. My hair appointment is today, I made it because my girlfriend just dyed her hair and I figured if she can change her appearance like that then I can too, but I’m starting to think I’ll probably just ask for an inch or two off to keep it tidy instead of getting it short like I want to. I’m anxious about getting my hair cut"
716,0,"I don't even know what's wrong with me anymore. I'm not sure if the symptoms I'm experiencing are from anxiety or if they're actually there and serious. It's driving me crazy. I'd like to know if anyone has gone through anything similar.

To preface, I've always had issues with anxiety. I saw a psychologist in the past due to issues with 'Pure O' OCD, and I would label myself a hypochondriac (I've gone through many different periods where I thought I was dying, including heart problems, cancers, MS/ALS, rabies - got this one really bad, and tetanus). With my long history of dealing with stress poorly and not being the healthiest I could be... ironically enough, that's keeping me from losing my mind completely right now.

Almost my entire body has experienced loss of sensation for a long time now (well over a year). Sometimes it feels like I have better days than others in terms of my physical numbness, and I do feel as if I've regained a bit of feeling back sometimes (particularly my genitals - they were more numb in the past and now they feel slightly more sensitive).

Recently, and I mean within the past few months, I feel like my right side is considerably more numb than my left. I don't know if that's due to my left side getting better or if my right side is getting worse, but I would say my left side feels... pretty normal? I don't know what the norm is anymore.

I finally took the plunge and got an appointment with a GP to get it looked at. I figured it wasn't normal to go on for so long like that... oh boy, I went through hell a few days ago. I went down a spiral of panic I've never experienced before. I felt like I was dying, there was that unreal sinking feeling through my entire being... I'm sure many of you understand completely.

I read up on something because I'm horrible at keeping my eyes away from Google. I was reading about MS... and, apparently, MS sufferers can have complications walking. Well guess what happened to me? My legs started to feel off balance. They starting having adrenaline pour through them non-stop, making me feel like I want to go run a mile but also not move an inch. It was both a lethargic and energizing feeling, and I absolutely hated it.

It spread to my arms. I feel this 'excited' state in my legs and arms (it's mostly my arms now, maybe because I started worrying about them more). My grip (particularly in my left hand) kinda sucks. I've been obsessing over testing it out. I'll put my phone in my hand, grip it, and shake it around furiously to see if my grip will fail me and my phone will fall. I've taken cartons of milk and stretched them out with that arm to see if it'll just fall right out (I can only hold it out for a few seconds but that's a hard exercise and I'm not particularly strong). I've dropped down and done push-ups to see if my legs and/or arms would fail me while doing that.

My arms feel pretty useless right now. They feel heavy and I don't want to use them because it feels like a chore. They feel slightly fatigued and I've gotten some pains around my upper bicep (probably because I'm doing all this stupid shit constantly for a few days now). My grip feels unreliable at best, it feels like things will fall out of my hands at any minute (they haven't, and I've gone about my days without falling down or dropping stuff, but it feels so, so, so much harder to do it than before). I'm worried that I'm showing clinical weakness rather than perceived weakness, and I'm worried that my muscles are going through atrophy. I'm constantly comparing my right side to my left side. I've lost a decent amount of weight over the past few weeks and I'm worried that it's actually muscle mass that's being lost (I've actually fixed by sleeping schedule and eating habits slightly before all of this, and I also haven't ate much the past few days due to my anxious state, so...).

An important note: my muscles have felt similar to this before. Over the past number of months, I'd go through random 2-3 days phases where my muscles and grip felt weak and horrible. I was at school so I had to power through it, and I could still do everything, but they felt like this. A sickly adrenaline, felt like I could barely hold my phone in front of my face, etc. If this was something serious (say, ALS) wouldn't I be in a lot worse state right now, about 2-3-4 months later? Do you guys think it could be worse now than it was when I had it back then because I had a pretty big panic attack (I'd say)?

I'm not looking for reassurance (okay, yes I am) and, as I've said, I have an appointment with my GP in a few days to get the ball rolling on all of this, but I'm stick in limbo right now. I want to know if anyone else has experienced this so I can either A) get mentally prepared for a bad diagnosis or B) start learning how to handle my health anxiety and anxiety in general. I've tried looking up more stuff on muscle weakness and the only times people have had it as bad as me or worse than me was when they had a deeper issue (like MS). Can regular anxiety/panic really make all of your limbs feel useless?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: also, I use my left hand for pretty much everything I do all the time - writing, using a fork/spoon, and using a mouse on my computer. Can that exacerbate anxiety-induced weakness for that hand? Someone tell me I'm not alone here"
717,0,"I've had to bounce around homes three different times since September. People who I think are friends let me stay with them, but then ask me to leave because I'm a hermit. I stay in my room and either browse Reddit or watch stuff on my PC.

I've been told when I talk to people it makes them uncomfortable, so I don't talk to people, hell I even got told that if I wanted to air things out (I've been through some s*** I won't get into here), that I should *GO TALK TO A DAMN HORSE*. That's not an exaggeration, that's literally the suggestion I was given. How TF is talking to an animal about past experiences going to help? The people I'm staying with have given me til the end of this month to find another place, but I needed help with deposits and such, so I contacted an organization and got that ball rolling. Problem is, they told me not to chase any housing leads until that bunch of shit got approved, and then didn't contact me about being approved til SIX DAYS after the fact. Got applications, waiting on approval which could take up to a week-time I don't have. So, after today, I'll be living in a hotel, but I can't afford to do that for more than a week, and I get to move all my shit-by myself-in 90+ degree heat.

725,0,"so I’ve always been extremely anxious, to the point of it becoming slightly irrational, example I used to be very worried when I had acne that if someone touched my face it would give me acne and if I have a cut on my foot and i’m outside I think that flesh eating bacteria is going to be in my foot because I read an article about that one time. Recently I had a particular anxious thought about something that seemed really irrational and it was that my room mate would put something in my clothes to make my hair fall out (because he has jokingly insinuated he will shave it while I sleep or put nair in my shampoo) and he is kind of a dick and I am moving out soon but that is a whole separate issue. Nonetheless, that’s the first time I had an anxiety thought that I KNEW was out there and not based in reality, so I considered the fact that I might be on the OCD spectrum. Since then I’ve been reading about the different types of OCD and almost borrowing them from other people and their things I have never even thought of in my life, like violent OCD (worrying about hurting people) yet I have never had any compulsions mental or physical that accompany them, do you guys think that I am just realizing I have OCD and it’s manifesting way more because I admitted it to myself or is this just a facet of my severe anxiety convincing myself something to freak myself out, tbh I do that a lot just looking for reassurance or advice :-/ I’m having anxiety about having OCD"

Anxiety Hack #1: Get up and move your body!
It’s pretty hard to give in to feelings of anxiety when you’re engaged in physical activity and those happy hormones, or endorphins, are getting released. This hack works best if you start moving as soon as you begin to experience those anxious thoughts and the adrenaline creeping in because it’ll prevent the anxiety from escalating. Choose a type of exercise you enjoy or even something childlike, such as bouncing on a trampoline or doing the “Cotton-Eyed Joe.” I dare you to try one of those and not crack a giggle. Also, if possible, take it outside for the extra benefits of sunlight, fresh air, and a dose of vitamin D. 

Anxiety Hack #2: BREATHE.
One of the most effective and simple deep breathing exercises for calming anxiety and overall relaxing is the 4-7-8 breathing technique developed by Dr. Andrew Weil (based off of pranayama yoga.) 
Here’s how you do it:
Find a quiet and comfortable place to either lie down or sit up straight with good posture.
Rest the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, right behind your front teeth.
Let your lips part and make an obnoxious whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.
Then, with your lips closed, inhale through your nose as you count to 4.
Hold that breath for 7 counts.
Exhale from your mouth for 8 counts. Don’t forget the annoying “whoooooooshhhhh!” It’s key. ;)
Do this at least four times.

Anxiety Hack #3: Repeat affirmations.
Saying affirmations out loud to yourself may seem out there, but can be extremely powerful when it comes to taming anxiety. The following affirmations have worked for me at the peak of an anxiety attack when I’ve felt crippled by that impending feeling of doom and darkness. 
“I am okay.”
“I’ve been here before. This too shall pass.”
“I am more than my anxiety.”
“I will transform my anxiety into positive, calming energy.”
“I breathe out tension and breathe in serenity.”
“I breathe out fear and breathe in love.”
“I will overcome this like I always do. I am getting stronger and stronger.”
“I am safe within myself. There is nothing to fear.”
“My body is filled with loving and calming energy.”

Anxiety Hack #4: Write it out.
Journaling, or just jotting down those thoughts that are running through your mind at the speed of light, in the moment can bring you some peace. If you don’t have a journal, use the notes section of your phone and write out whatever thoughts you have running through your mind. Whether it’s a to-do list of things you need done by the end of the week, a poem, or a bunch of swear words, writing it down (or typing it out) is a form of release. Trust me, you will feel some tension lift.

Anxiety Hack #5: Listen to feel good music.
Music has a powerful effect on your mood and energy. The key is to listen to happy, calming music, even if that’s not the type of music in your Spotify library. Choose music that reflects the way you want to feel and that will soothe your anxious mind. Personally, my go-to for happy, relaxing beats is anything by Kygo, Sam Feldt, or Bonobo.

Anxiety Hack #6: Get in touch with your spiritual side.
Connecting to a higher power is pretty much a guaranteed way of calming down feelings of anxiety. Whether you choose to pray, meditate, chant mantras, or hold crystals, doing something spiritual will help ground you and give you peace of mind. My favorite way to calm my restless mind at night is to take an epsom salt bath, turn on my latest Headspace meditation, close my eyes, and just focus on my breathing. Actually, this combines three anxiety hacks into one 10-minute activity - meditating (getting in touch with my spiritual side), deep breathing (hack #2), and self-care (hack #7). 

Anxiety Hack #7: Show yourself some tender love and self-care.
There’s nothing better than stopping an anxiety attack in its tracks by doing something pleasurable for your mind and body. When you feel those dreaded, worry-filled thoughts manifest in your body as a rapid heartbeat or sweaty palms, throw your hands up, say “that’s enough!” and go treat your poor body like royalty. Get a massage, give yourself a facial treatment, get a mani-pedi, take a bath, get your hair did, anything that you know will make you feel good, physically. Taking care of yourself and your body is therapeutic. Self-care is a form of self-love and self-love produces positive thoughts and emotions, which crowd out those negative, fearful feelings.

Anxiety Hack #8: Love your anxiety.
Yes, you read that right. One of the ways we tend to make our anxiety worse is by judging it and ourselves as something negative and horrible that needs fixing. If there’s one thing you take away from reading this article, I hope it’s this -  every belief or behavior has a positive intention, therefore any negative thoughts or destructive behaviors are not the problem. They are just the best solution you have come up with so far.
What if, instead of looking at your anxiety as something you hate and want to “fix”, you saw it as the only way your mind knows how to cope with whatever it is you are dealing with? What if you looked at your battles with anxiety as victories that make you a stronger person? What if you listened to what your anxiety is trying to tell you and focus on fixing that problem?
The thing about anxiety is, we put so much energy, time, and money into trying to heal the symptoms of anxiety when what we really need to heal is the fear or trauma that triggers this unnerving cascade in the first place. Which brings me to the last hack…

Anxiety Hack #9: Listen to and get acquainted with your body.
If you’re experiencing symptoms of anxiety and you have no clue why or where they’re coming from, it’s time to take a closer look at your lifestyle choices and health. Three of the top anxiety triggers are caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. If you’re consuming any or all of these, try eliminating them from your diet for a few weeks, preferably a full month. Then, slowly add one in at a time to see how your body responds. Chances are, you won’t go back and if you do, you’ll find a healthier and more moderate way to integrate it into your lifestyle. 
Health issues, hormonal imbalances, and food allergies can also trigger anxiety. Make sure you know what’s going on inside your body. Knowledge about your body’s natural tendencies and providing your body with nourishing, whole foods is groundbreaking when it comes to managing your anxiety. Once you’re more in touch with your body and its needs, you begin to trust your mind and body and their reactions. You’ll begin to feel energy shifts when you walk into rooms or engage with others. Your intuition becomes clearer and you’ll be able to tell the difference between “good vibes” and “bad vibes”...and act accordingly. 9 Hacks To Get A Handle On Your Anxiety Right Now"
735,0,"Hello, good pople

At first, I'd like to apologize for the mistakes I'm gonna make throughout this post as English is my second language and I feel the lack of knowledge in CBT in general to manage my emotions myself.

So I have a relationship wit my girlfriend for almost 3 years. All of this time it was not ok meaning that it has always some amount of anxiety. All the time there is a scent of a game - one gives and the other doesn't seem to need it. I've cheated once when we had ""hard times"" and after a year I've told her about it. Actually it was my ex. So it's kinda double fuck-up - doing this and telling it to my girlfriend. I've always seem to be co-dependent in relationships starting from school. Always trying to please a girl and by age of 32 I seem to lose my identity completely.

I have a somewhat good job (but I wanna have the better one), I have a hobby (playing drums which I'm not playing actually, I'm always only TRYING to get to concistency of praticing it), I almost have no friends. This inner-picture of myself is very infant and I cannot rely on myself completely so I get dependent very easily.

And as you know when you get denpendent the easiest way is just to switch the object of the dependence. It looks like I'm always in search of a home, the lost meaning of it.

With that being said, I constantly feel the lack of attention and strength to go on without trying to contribute to the poor relationships that I have. And I can't get out of this cycle. I know that the reason is that I lack self-love in the first place but I get doomed so easily so the proactivity seems to go away so rapidly, I cannot get into the vibe and I'm going down the spiral.

I'm seeing my therapist once in a while but she has not much free time for me. On the last session I've learned that I need to be more aware of the things I want to do in my life, starting from the littlest things as which way to go during a walk or which food to eat. It kinda helps but at the point of emotional stress it all gets senseless. But in fact she got the point - I've been numb to my own intentions for a huge amount of time trying to get someone's attention.

736,0,"So I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), which causes me to worry about EVERYTHING. Most of my worries revolve around my health. Every little ache and pain that I feel sends my mind into worst case scenario mode and then I spend the next several days worrying about dying. For example, I started Celexa recently for anxiety and depression, and it caused me to have a dry heaving episode. Later that day I experienced some chest and back pain. Ever since then (this was 5 days ago) I’ve been terrified that I have Boerhaave Syndrome, which is a type of esophageal rupture. I even went to the ER for it last night because my anxiety was so bad and they told me I was fine. 

This is just such a miserable way to live. I’m constantly worried that I’m sick and dying and I’m not even enjoying my life. I don’t know what to do and it really sucks. 😔 Does anyone else have anxiety like this? Any tips on how to get through it? Constant Worry (GAD)"

738,0,"So I lost so many people I used to stay in contact with. I tried getting girlfriends but I've been friendzoned by every single one of them and I kept my distance away from them since then. Even my friends are becoming strangers, some who are getting girlfriends or even new friends. Some have also travelled and all I still have is one friend(currently been busy with a girl) and that's it.
I am not motivated to meet new people anymore nor am I interested in getting a girl after the recent series of rejections. I dont know what to do, i feel shit socially and i also feel like everyone i meet gets a bad impression of me. I also get anxiety when meeting new people and i think its because i dont think im that type of person who is always hyped up and fun.

739,0,"I have been struggling with anxiety for a few years now, I’ve also been diagnosed with ptsd and depression as of 2018. Just last week I had a breakdown and attempted suicide. As of now I’m currently being exempt from school while I make my decision on whether to transition to do my trial tests and the actual test for senior year and graduate or drop out from school and continue my tests through another option like tafe (I’m Australian).
I’m struggling to figure out the right decision, if I stay and finish I’ll continue to have breakdowns over school and will receive a poor result and graduate. Or if I leave school I’m worried I won’t be able to get anywhere in life and I’ll be stuck drowning in my own self pity.
My parents are supportive and care for me deeply and I have the support, that’s not my problem. I just don’t know if there’s a life for me out of high school, it’d be great if I could get some advice and insight on life after school with anxiety. I’m sorry if this is worded poorly I’ve never been the best at writing. Making the decision whether to drop out or stay for senior year. (Long)"

741,0,"ok this isn’t about my house being haunted or anything, i just need to clarify!

ok so i have gad, aka generalized anxiety or whatever and i have a really annoying fear of ghosts.

however, i really love horror, but i’m very specifically terrified of ghost rituals i can easily do. i don’t believe in them, but they terrify me.

its sort of a “you can do this and you’ll die! what if its real and you die! and its super easy”. like bloody mary and baby blue made me freak it at 1 am. they send me into panic attacks.

i eventually sort of did the blue baby thing, which i can assure you is very fake. however, i came across a new one i am way too scared to try. once i try them and they don’t work, it subsides my fear, so i’m tempted to try it but not fully yet.

its basically this game where you go in a bathtub, say stuff, and some ghost chick will kill you if you don’t catch her. its a japanese urban legend, but for some reason it’s really really messing with me.

id ask someone to do it for me and reassure me, bc then i’ll try it and my fear will be fine or whatever. however i don’t know anyone who’ll be kinda enough to do that.

i dont know what to do, because i really really enjoy horror and every single ghost related thing reminds me of this dumb urban legend. and its making me soo upset because i love horror! i don’t know what to do to subside this silly fear of this urban legend. i need advice/reassurance [tw: mentions of paranormal]"
742,0,"This is my own copy/paste below from a previous comment I made to vent. I realize now that there's an anxiety subreddit. And everything below still remains the same, but I'll add a bit more to the end. 

I was just diagnosed with anxiety. I had no idea what it was like before. I just thought people were nervous like a test. At least for me that just mild. It's more like if I'm going to live the next day because something must be wrong with me. It doesn't make sense that I can just sit innocently on my couch, watching a movie, eating dinner, and all of a sudden I look at my girlfriend and tell her I think i'm going to die.

I sustained a leg injury from a back injury (sciatica maybe) and it just got so bad. Slept for maybe 1-2 hours total for 2 weeks when my leg issue started. Then randomly, I remember just talking to my physio therapist to help my sciatica and just before we even started, I remember a huge ringing in my ear, and then my head got super cloudy and almost felt dense. I just felt like life was leaving my body and told her I think my heart stopped. She laid me down seconds away from passing out. That was the first time. The second time, on the couch, and my heart was minimum 100bpm for no reason. And I remember panicking as fuck. Telling her not to let me die. Telling her to call my mom. What do I do. Do I call 911? I called my mom. Voice was shaking uncontrollably, trying to be as calm as possible. Fiancé instructing me to breathe as she rubs my back. I can't stop telling her I love her. Mom says go to the hospital now. I say I can't make it. I get off the phone. Call 911. Ambulance is at my house in 4 minutes. I'm laying on the couch now. I'm hooked up to their EKG, and they were insanely calm. Told me I'm going to be okay and I'm not having a heart attack. I'm not going to die. They administered my prescribed/Rx Lorazepam and swallowed. Heart rate went down... They said they don't need to take me to the hospital because it's not life threatening, so I signed my waiver and took their word for it.

Since then, I caved and made a large post on social media for anyone on my friends list. I barely use Facebook but I creep alot just to stay up to date. This was a 3:30 in the morning because I couldn't sleep. Any time I try to sleep is my nightmare because that's when my walls come down. Idle hands and mind are the devils playground. So all day, all night I just wonder if I'm gonna make it. So so so many people reached out to me, and told me that I'm okay. And that they too have never told anyone they have been dealing with it for years. They thought they were alone. I thought I was alone. I cried for the first time in maybe 5 years. I cried hard. I just want to live. I'm crying as I type this.

It made me so humble. I held my fiancé closer. I just celebrated my 5 year anniversary together with her and she's my rock. I think i'm going to be okay. Every day is a struggle. I'm going to be okay.

I just love everything and anyone.

Thank you for listening. This is extremely unlike me.

Now the addition: I have no idea what the trigger is. If there even is one. I know what seems to possibly set me off. But then also doing nothing at all, and thinking of absolutely nothing can set me off.

I tried CBD oil, 2 different brands. None of them do a thing. I don't do alcohol anymore even though it was a rare occasion. With summer here, I used to drink more frequently, like one or two beers every few days. I used to smoke weed for a few years daily. I havent smoked regularly since I'd say 2 weeks ago. I decided to try a super super small amount 2 days ago, but I felt a feeling that was not usual so I just stopped then and there.

This morning I woke up, and I'd just lay there in bed calmly with the birds in the background. I was cruising Facebook, and I don't post often anyway, I just like to stay up to date. I have my fan blowing on me. And I just felt off all of a sudden. I felt a bit short of breath. So I stood up and my heart just started racing, and Im looking at my fiancé and her mom and I'm just like ""man, I just feel really hot in my chest."" and I started breathing, and my hands and feet became clammy. It didn't get further than that, but now 2 hours later, and the heart beat is fine now, it's regular in the 70s, but my heart still feels tired. And I'm yawning more now. And that's after maybe 9 hours of sleep.

Im trying to rationalize that I'm not dying... But it's hard when I'm so hyper aware of my heart. Doctor said everything is fine when I last saw him almost 2 weeks ago. I'm just feeling stuck. I can do nothing and think nothing and still have an episode. I was 3 days clean, but now I'm back to this. Anxiety? Hell if I know..."

744,0,"Im a 36 year old male.

Im finding myself looking at my spouse of 3.5 years and not recognizing her. Like she is a new person in my life. I am unable to recall most of my memories of our times together. It at times feels like Ive been with her for a few weeks - not 3.5 years. Deep down inside I KNOW that we've been together that long, but I have very little memories of it. Its really beginning to affect my relationship with her since its getting harder and harder to connect with her (I assume because I am unable to recall memories of us together, making a long term relationship difficult).

I have seen a neurologist and had 2 MRI's. Both came back normal. I am seeing a psychiatrist and we have tried numerous medications, but nothing seems to be helping. I have also had dozens of sessions with a normal therapist. This all started about a year and a half ago and I am feeling like I am at the very beginning stages of some form of dementia like Alzheimer's or something.

Any thoughts or others going through something similar? I'm starting to not recognize my spouse... Is this just some form of anxiety or something like the first stages of dementia?"
745,0,"I’m in the golden years, I have so many friends, so many opportunities to go out and have fun but I pass them all down because of my anxiety.

I don’t have these attacks when I’m asleep and my medication makes me sleepy so I probably sleep about 19 hours a day. This does actually work I don’t get attacks doing what I’m doing. But I can’t live like this, and I need to go to work on Sunday. I have like 2 days to be able to go outside again. This whole Depersonalization thing started on Tuesday by the way.

My nephews are the same age as my kids. They're rude to my kids and adults but they're never held accountable for their actions. ""Boys will be boys.""

I'm filled with dread and anxiety anticipating our next trip of being ignored and fielding ""joking"" insults from my mother. I'm an adult reduced to a child and I don't know how to change the situation. I'm dreading a family visit where I'm made to feel like an outsider."

748,0,"My (25f) best friend has been....there but not there? I've never experienced this with her before until like 10 months ago when she got into one relationship and basically acted like I wasn't alive, would make up reasons she couldn't take an hour out of her day to go to Target with me (some Bs I asked her to do since we hadn't seen each other in a month). Then she broke up with him &amp; at one point after we were hanging out with her other friend and he was like didn't this this and this red flag thing happen and I was like woah would you ever have told me any of that? It made me really sad because it just showed me how much our friendship was worth in that moment. And then everything went back to normal kind of, she started talking to me like we used to and then she got into another relationship and i know she's not telling me everything but at least shes talking to me and I'm always just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

So like I know that when someone gets into a relationship things shift around and that's whatever but she like literally tells me nothing anymore but will put it on social media (like how her new gf is supposedly moving to our area now?) and it makes me feel like I'm not worth the effort. I mean we used to always tell each other everything for years so having someone not be apart of your routine anymore is hard. 

She's basically the only friend I have and I'm supposed to be going on a trip with her and some of her family in August. I want to say something bc if she's supposedly my best friend I should be able to talk to her but it gives me a lot of anxiety to even think about because what if she thinks im like mad she's in a good relationship or what if she stops talking to me even more than what she is and I don't want to ruin the trip for anyone....and honestly I don't want to be alone. I've had friends come and go throughout the years but she's been my one constant and I don't want to lose that by saying my truth and having her resent me for it.

I know everyone automatically says you should tell her you should tell her, but the amount of anxiety it gives me is wild. And I always end up putting things back onto myself by asking ""am I a bad friend"" or ""did I do something wrong"" and I don't want to do that either bc I'm not the one who's changed. So what would y'all do? It should seem simple"

I think verbalizing these worries to others will make it feel better and alleviate some of the ache. But it just makes me feel stupid. I had felt a couple months ago that I had made significant progress with my mental health. Now I feel like I’ve fallen down a ditch that was far deeper than before. My college career is ending soon. Soon I’ll have my degree and I’ll have to go to grad school. I’m afraid that if I don’t get a grip I won’t be able to function. As I toss and turn more fear fills up my insides.

Because i so desperately want help with my anxiety. i was there on time, spend 45 minutes in the waiting room. At first i was okay, waiting patiently and then after 30 minutes i got so angry. After 45 minutes i went to the receptionist to ask what was going on, and she told me there had been a misunderstanding.

I almost broke down in tears, i was so sad and felt like no one cared. I finally reached out, asking for help. its hard to do that and then this happens. 
I rescheduled for juli 11th, but i feel like i need help before that... two weeks is alot of time when you are feeling this way every day. 

When i walked out of the place, I immediately started crying so hard. I am kinda worried about how much that simple misunderstanding bothered me...

752,0,"Right now I'm meant to be doing uni work but I feel such an overwhelming feeling of stress around it that it sends me into panic. Its become habit now that I just completely block out anything that causes me stress, instead of dealing with things head on. I just stick my head in the sand like an ostrich and hope for my problems to go away, when I should be just adressing them. 

A lot of the time its just stupid small things, like checking emails, or starting on an essay. Its paralysing, and I feel like people see me as lazy, when the reality is I feel incapable of putting myself in a position where I might have a panic attack. The worst part is the avoidance of different situations creates more problems for me.

Whenever you google stuff about ""fear of transportation"" or ""afraid of driving"" it's hundreds and hundreds of results of people being afraid of themselves driving or if it's public transport it's a whole social anxiety thing. It makes me feel really crazy and alone. 

I know I'm not though, like I know that a lot of people have anxiety around flying in this way. This developed for me after a car accident that popped my sense of control. Car accidents happen all the time so there must be other people in my situation, right? I essentially can be fine driving myself but being driven by others, buses, planes, trains/the subway, or even boats I have a hard time with. I'll be literally unable to go or be overcome with terror for the entire ride thinking that I'm a second away from death. I feel like I'm handing my life into the hands of a random, likely overworked and tired person. It's honestly ruining my life and making me a shut in. Like if we have a fun event planned ahead of time somewhere unreasonable or impossible to drive to I'll be constantly worrying about the transport from the moment the plan is announced.

However, I find that I still really struggle with texts. I always feel so anxious texting people and it’s on several different layers. Firstly, my SAD makes me question why someone is texting me at all and I constantly feel like I must be a bother and I can’t tell what they’re thinking and they’re showing everyone what I’ve said. The second is my GAD makes my hyperbolize the worst reasons they could possibly not be texting me back, so If someone takes a while to respond I start to freak out thinking something tragic has happened. I know all of this is so illogical, but I was wondering is anyone has any experience like this? Does anyone here struggle specifically with texting/virtual interactions?"

This week, my anxiety was the best its been in more than five months. I actually felt like I was some semblance of myself again.

Then, last night out of absolutely nowhere, I and a panic attack, It was a little one, only lasted about a minute, but the feeling was unmistakable. That feeling that you could drop dead at any minute.

Today, my Mom told me that my Grandfather has a blockage near his heart. He might need surgery to fix it, and heart surgery is a really serious thing. He's also at immediate risk of a heart attack. I can't stop all of the what ifs clamoring around in my mind. I can't shake the picture of my Grandmother all alone in that big house. It's horrible. 

Everything is flooding back again. I can feel the stress of it all dragging me back down and there's nothing that I can do to make it stop.

760,0,"So I started driving at 24 years old. I’m 25 now. I’m pretty good driving to places like work and the grocery store. But I can’t drive to another grocery store. Or another gas station. I have to like pick and plan my commute to my gas station, or even my bank. If I’m in another area, I avoid going to the closest bank branch or gas station, I have to drive home, then drive to that particular bank or gas station. I can’t just decide to go to another one, I’d have to know a route there that I practiced.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s not that I can’t really go to another destination, it’s I avoid it. And when I push through, bad things tend to happen. Yesterday I went to FedEx to drop off an RMA package, and I had to take this really windy road I never go on. But I’ve been on it before, I just get anxious taking it. And sure enough, I blew through a stop sign and had to swerve right to stay on the road, I didn’t see the stop sign, I didn’t know the road was going to slight right like that. It’s like things like this kill me, I beat myself up over it.

&amp;#x200B;

It was just a few weeks ago but my Dad and I were driving to an area I’ve never been to, and the ride was okay for the most part until Google told me take the second left and I did but then it started rerouting and I was on the parkway and I had to merge and I have very little highway experience and all I know is to speed up to merge but there was no way, it was too busy. I was freaking out and I was trying to merge but then I almost merged into another car... And my Dad is in the passenger seat making it no better, he’s over 60 and has driving anxiety big time.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my brother starting calling and I looked away for one second and I almost hit a telephone pole. And then on our way back, I went into two really deep potholes and my car started making all sorts of sounds, and I pulled into a parking lot and just as I did, the noises stopped like whatever got stuck inside the wheel got back out. Which was a relief but I just felt like a terrible driver. I feel like I shouldn’t even be on the road...

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing is, this stuff never happens when I drive where I know... It happens when I go more than a few miles from my house, I end up doing stupid shit. And then I feel like absolute shit and feel debilitated. I end up telling people I can’t do things because I’d have to drive and I can’t drive there. I hear people all the time going on road trips but I can’t even manage driving to the most basic places. I avoid it at all costs and when I do try, and I don’t mess up, I still don’t feel any better about it.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn’t help that I have huge issues talking to people. It’s like I have foot in mouth syndrome. It’s just getting to me, it’s been over a year I’ve been driving and I feel crippled at it. I just don’t leave the house unless it‘s for work or some place I know how to get to. I never go anywhere new, I stay home because I’d rather not have the stress and anxiety.

I think there's mice droppings under my kitchen sink? How do I get rid of this. Even opening the sink I'm now worried about hantavirus. Is there an easy fix for this hole? Can I just tape it? 

And then also I turned the ac on and I think it was blowing soot out from the heater? The ac is in the roof but I think it blows air into the heater and this soot is coming out and it's on the floor. It crumbles easily so I think it's soot or something but is that safe?

Also there's that random thing in one of the cabinets. I haven't touched it and don't know what it is. 

Finally there's this hole that I had already noticed in the closet but I didn't think much except roaches until now seeing the probable mice droppings. 

How do I clean this all up or fix it so I can start feeling safe in my home. I'm normally not this bad but stress especially triggers my hypochondria / health anxiety / generalized anxiety. Please help I feel so stupid

766,0,"My mother (65) has always been an anxious person and always worries about things especially when it comes to her health. She has trust issues (likely a traumatic experience when she was younger, but I can't say for certain because she doesn't want to talk about it when asked) and only believes in herself and not the actions or opinions of others (including her family at times).

Last week my mother fell and fractured her hip which required surgery to fix it. She was adamant not to have surgery and wanted to let it heal naturally despite doctors professional advice. It took our family 2 days to convince her to have surgery which was meant to take place 48 hours of the incident.

Now she is refusing to take medication from doctors such as pain killers, antibiotics, blood thinners because she is worried that nurses are prescription the wrong medication to her and is worried that it will cause more harm than good because her leg is now swollen.

It's been really frustrating on both medical staff and our family because the longer she stays in the hospital, the higher the chance of other health complications.

I barely remember what happened because my glasses flew off during impact and I was hysterically crying and hyperventilating the next 2 hours. I feel so dumb I just saved up money for this car and I was so proud of myself for accomplishing one thing. I can't avoid this stressful situation like I usually do so this has been one of the most overwhelming events in my life. I can't help but keep replaying what happened on my dashcam and my mind. Thinking of what I could have done and how stupid I am. I can't avoid dealing with my situation but I managed to avoid telling my dad, sisters, and friends. I only told my mom and an old family friend. Too many people judging me right now will cause me not to function. Now my mind is just overthinking and stressing about the increase of my insurance because of my age and my at fault accident. I don't think I'm gonna be able to drive again either because of my fear, anxiety and paranoia. Just when I thought things couldn't get any more stressful, I got into my first car accident"

Last week one of the directors called me in to say they want me to be more proactive and pushy and really go out of my way to develop strategies, make the case for them and implement them.

This is great, but also terrifying, as I will have to be very pushy and bossy and argumentative, which aren't my strong suits, and confrontation makes me super anxious.  What helps me is to have someone in mind to serve as inspiration whenever I get anxious - ""wwjd"" sort of thing, only replace j with some other public figure who is strong and determined and who pushed through obstacles.

779,0,"Hi, 
Any advice or help will be much much appreciated and very very needed right now! 
As the title says I am right now experiencing a bad bout of anxiety that's making me want to just lock myself up and cry my eyes out. And worst part is I know it's for something really trivial but these things bother me alot! 

So a lil background, I'm doing 2 classes simultaneously one is a dance class and one is a professional course (marketing) I'm not currently working. And both these classes are on the weekend but different timings. 

Today however the dance class is just before my marketing class and I have to travel 30-40 minutes from one part of the city to another! And I can't bunk the dance one (cz it's technical rehearsal for our performance tomorrow) can't bunk the marketing one today (cz I'll be bunking it for the performance anyway) 

Now I've never been late for either of these classes but today I will definitely be late to the marketing one by atleast 30-40 minutes! 

Any other person wouldn't be too bothered by this I know, but my anxiety has been acting up all morning and I don't know why and I don't know how to get rid of it either! 

Any help or advice will be much much appreciated! 

Thanks in advance! 

tl;dr - anxiety about juggling two classes at the same time! I feel imperfect cz of the anxiety I get for trivial things :("

782,0,"I'm absolutely terrified of accidentally hurting or offending people, especially persons I'm close to. If I think I've said or done something wrong, I can't stop thinking about it and I will worry sick until I get some sort of closure that it isn't as big of a deal as I thought it was.

This is obviously also painfully true when it comes to my SO. Sometimes I would just like to have a talk with her, ask her if everything's okay, if x thing I've done or said bothered her, etc. However, I am scared that if I do try to have such conversations and it turns out that I've been stressing out for nothing, she'll think that she's giving me the impression of being offended/hurt and that she's causing me to worry this badly (which she absolutely isn't, it's a problem that's only on me, she could seem perfectly fine and happy and I'd probably still find something to stress about). Basically, I don't want her to think that she's sending bad signals and feel bad about it, because it isn't the case. 

I'm also worried that I'd annoy her by always needing reassurance that things are fine. Plus, I'm scared that my texting anxiety would show, and that I'd come off as too clingy: I often get stressed out when people don't reply to me at the rhythm they usually do, thinking I must've done something wrong even though they're probably just busy or something, and it's a pretty common trigger of my worries. 

As an example of the kind of out-of-nowhere worries that I'm talking about; we hung out today. It was fun and I think both of us had a good time. But once I got back home, I started worrying that some things I said or done might've come out wrong, although I absolutely had no bad intentions when saying/doing said thing. I can't stop thinking about it as of right now, and even though there's a part of me that's thinking that I'm just stressing out for no reason as usual, I can't help but imagine worst-case scenarios. She did tell me one time when we were discussing about my tendency to overguilt and overapologize that she would tell me if something was wrong, but I can't help but wonder ""what if this time though she didn't??"".

So yeah, basically:

•is a bad idea to try and have these talks with her? 

•if so, what other ways can I get reassurance that things are ok and that she's not hurt or offended?

•if not, how do i engage in such conversations without alarming her or annoying her?

Thank you... :$

TLDR; often thinking i've accidentally hurt/offended my SO, would like to discuss w/ her to get reassurance that she's ok but scared that I'll annoy her/she'll think me worrying so much is her fault I'd really want to speak with my SO to ease my mind about stupid stuff I worry about too much - but I don't know how or if its right"
783,0,"long read personal sob story i just need support or help i feel so lost and sad and wanna cry i love her so much 

i’ve talked to this girl on snapchat since we were 15 we never rlly hung out we went to different schools but stayed in close touch all the time and we’d always be there for each other no matter what we considered ourselves best friends.

we hangout a few times on and off and i would have random moments in time where i have lots of feelings for her and wanna tale stuff further but she never felt that way. we both have anxiety and we are pretty similar people quiet and introverted. 

she recently told me she had feelings for me and we start talking like crazyyyy texting and snapping constantly and we both in love it feels great i’m so happy about all of this i couldn’t wait to get home and see her and we talked about so much stuff we would do when we get back from vacation. 

we hung out last night and smoked a blunt together and we talked about how we wanted to cuddle and watch a movie and kiss and do all this fun stuff together that made me so excited. we sit on my dock for a good hour barely even talking just quiet and i’m anxious as all fuck and she said she’s tired and wants to go home.

when she leaves i immediately burst into tears because i thought i fucked everything up and i text her about it all and tell her how i felt and said i shouldn’t b so hard on myself and it was okay she was just tired and i understand that so we hang again today.

we go to her best friends  who she’s always with and smoke a few bowls and there we go again not talking whatsoever and i don’t know what to say and she just laughs with her friend and faces away from me looking at stuff on her phone.

i really love her :( i show so much love and care way toooo fucking much and it’s not good for me. i wanna see her more but i tnink tonight rlly fucked it she said she was so anxious there and on way home and now she’s being all dry and not showing any love or nothin i just wanna cry i keep crying and feel like i’m doing something so wrong and i’m just such an awkward fuck guys i don’t kno what to say i’m just so sick of this

793,0,"On a second account, happened on my main. 

TL;DR creepy reddit account commented a compliment on my deleted post that just seemed *too* coincidental, after already being a bit of a dick. Is this my anxiety making me overthink or is this actually creepy. 

I posted on this sub a couple days ago asking advice on a piercing, just general stuff about changing jewellery- nothing graphic, nothing nsfw. 

This guy comments ‘gross.’ , so obviously I tell him to fuck off- it’s unnecessary (poking the bear, I know, but I acted on impulse). A few more comments were exchanged along the lines of:

Him: remember rule #1 (be nice)

Me: so what you said was nice?

Back and forth like that, going nowhere- the couple next responses were pretty much ‘no, you’. Silly of me to feed into a troll, but oh well. I deleted the post and all the comments to him since another Redditor gave me some sound advice and left it at that. 

Today, a couple days later he comments again saying ‘hey, ready to be nice now’ , so I comment ‘dude, stop’ thinking maybe he has the jist that it’s not really funny to anyone anymore. He does, for a bit, then comments a good while later ‘your hair looks nice today’. 

Now normally I’d brush this under the rug, but today I did my hair up really nicely and went into central London to meet some friends so it just seems like too much of a coincidence, especially since the comment didn’t come until I was at a busy pub in London and he was active in between. 

I took a peek at his account and it’s all kinda creepy misogynistic stuff that doesn’t seem to be too much of a troll, just creepy. Am I right to be worried or is it coincidence? Creepy reddit guy- just my dumb anxiety brain or actually a stalker"
794,0,"Whenever my partner wakes up, comes home or just enters the same room as me, I am on edge. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, so it is my go to explanation. But, I have considered something darker as the cause. If I am on edge about something that actually might happen, is that even anxiety? Because I never know what his mood will be. He is a gas lighter, confirmed by describing a few of our interactions to my therapist. So he can come in the room and be in an off mood (grumbling, shuffling things around necessarily, cold look) and if I call him out, he gets pretty defensive about being just fine. If I don't bother calling him out, he sometimes insists on interacting and being a bit of a twat about it. Sometimes, we both just breeze through the whole thing, no words, but I still feel the edge, his ""vibes"". 

This post definitely has a venting element to it, but I am genuinely asking for input and/or advice. We have been together for so long (10+ years), and I have often considered leaving him, but we are balls deep in this relationship and there is a lot of mess that comes with that option. I know couples counseling is definitely in order, but I can't even get him to do his own therapy. At this point, at-home remedies for this ache and pain would be amazing. Is it anxiety, fear, or something else?"
795,0,"I dont know what the problem with my voice is but I've been dealing with this issue for years. I never had a speech impediment growing up, I did have a slight lisp that I was very self conscious of, but it is nothing like the problem I have been facing recently. 

I have recently been aware that my speech will become increasingly harder to get out when I am anxious but this also happens when I'm comfortable too. The problem is that when I notice my speech becoming weird it feeds my anxiety and frustration, so it is a vicious cycle of anxiety and pain that makes me not want to speak or makes it so I anticipate that things I'm going to have to say are going to come out all fucked up.

I hate this. I fucking hate having to go out and be social and having people look at me like what the fuck is wrong with this guy, or more recently people mocking my speech problems because I am making them feel uncomfortable(plus I'm an easy target). Fuck you! Would you ever say to a person with a facial deformity ""what the fuck is wrong with your face!!! Gross!""..... NO??? Then why the FUCK is it acceptable to say to me ""why dont you speak a little clearer, you sound like a retard"" oh sorry you are right I am forcing myself to talk like a dumbass. 

Sorry for my anger I just had to let some steam off. If anyone else has been dealing with this kind of problem I'd love to hear about it.

Any situation, really, where I feel like I have to keep my composure.

Meetings. Going out to a bar. In the grocery store. Just a simple conversation about baseball with a coworker. Doesn’t matter - I start thinking about the what if’s. What if I start freaking out? What if they notice? What if I end up looking weak? Even worse, what if I were to finally faint from one of these?

I’ve had some wins recently that I can hold on to. Last week I had a panic attack after some heavy squats in the gym, I cut my workout short and left completely defeated. Stay in my car for a few minutes and then told myself I wasn’t going to let this ruin me - went back in the gym and finished my scheduled workout. 

I’ve also been able to talk to relatives and friends at least without beginning to panic (a couple weeks ago it didn’t matter who it was). I’ve begun self help techniques and listen to audio books from Anxiety experts. 

I just can’t get over the thought of stepping to my boss’ desk, him beginning to have a legitimate conversation with me about some work issue, and me not being able to stand there and listen because of a panic attack. It’s happened so much lately and the fear is paralyzing me.

797,0,"I have GAD and OCD. 

&amp;#x200B;

My partner is bipolar and suicidal at times, and I'm always there to reassure her and keep her from the ledge so to speak. But I need to make ends meet and I picked up a second job, keeping her alone more often. She's on meds, but about once a week will refuse them, then be happy to take them other days.

I'm afraid to not be in ""control"" of the situation, and fear that every moment that I'm gone, she could be dead. This is something I've always dealt with in relationships anyway, but being with someone where it's *actually* a possibility has made it worse.

I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to stop being so afraid. She's so stable most of the time, and will go months and months without an episode, but the possibility lingers still. She could be great for 6 months, then one evening when I'm gone...who knows.

I'm just lost, dude. We love each other and have a very healthy relationship otherwise. 360 days a year it's fine, but those other five terrify me so much. Thanks for reading. Girlfriend is bipolar, and I'm afraid to leave her alone. Afraid to not be in control"
798,0,"Today, after being unemployed for a few months, I got a job - a Technical Support role. I should be delighted, and do feel some sense of relief. But I'm upset. 

Five months ago, I was offered a role which offered a salary nearly double this one, in a role which would have had amazing career prospects and chances for advancement. This was a time of terrible anxiety for me though. I turned it down, my GAD convinced me it was too good for me and I would blow everything. Then, a month later I took another well paid role, which I promptly quit 3 weeks in after becoming extremely anxious again. I was qualified for both these roles, capable, and had several years of experience. But, the anxiety of change was so overwhelming and painful. I felt like I was on fire, and my life was in danger. In my last real job I actually did last nearly five years, I can do it, I just went through a really bad patch this year.

So today, when I should be feeling relieved at getting a job and knowing I'll be able to pay rent, I feel sad. I am picturing the me from an alternate universe who was happy to stay in these other much more well paid roles, who does not suffer so badly with GAD, and has not lost the entire last three months to the resulting heavy depression.

GAD has taken so many opportunities from me, professionally, romantically, family relationships, life experiences, and has taken so much from me. I've achieved plenty, and experienced plenty, and know I'm just at a low point right now, and I will get back up. But I am sad today, and empty, and feeling sorry for myself. I know there are people out there have it much worse than me. I just needed to write some of this down. Feeling very sad and empty today"

hello all! i'd first like to start off by saying that although i am not clinically diagnosed with any type of anxiety disorder, i can definitely identify with many of the struggles that some of the people on this sub go through. if you look through my posts, the majority of them are related to health anxiety that has gotten fairly bad throughout the past 6 months.

i am 19, F, and still fairly dependent on my parents (still live with them, transportation, finances, insurance, etc). my anxiety about my health (or possible medical issues) has caused them quite a bit of trouble - i've made my dad take me to the ER about once a month since december, visited our PCP a few times, and now, a gastroenterologist.

every test so far that i've had has come back negative or normal. because of this, it becomes frustrating for my parents (also myself) that i can't seem to ever feel satisfied with my results. my parents deal with diagnosed medical conditions and receive therapy/medication for such conditions but are able to power through. my mom has been a stay-at-home mom for over a decade and my dad is in the military so they honestly have a lot more on their plate then i do. it may not be fair to compare situations but objectively, my parents do have more to worry about and should be worried about more things but they are able prioritize their feelings.

yesterday, i cried to my mom after saying that i feel like i couldn't breathe for the past 3 days (along with my GI symptoms) and she immediately told me to shut up and to stop bothering her. she kept telling me my test keep coming back negative and that everything i have been experiencing is all in my head. i told her that i'm afraid to die and she just said that i was overreacting. she brought up how at all of our doctor's visits she can tell that the doctors see me in a certain way in that i have the tendency to be so sure about what's wrong with me which made me even more anxious bc then it aligns with my bias that no one is taking me seriously. my dad also feels the same way.

this month, it's been so bad that i started to sleep in the same room as my younger siblings, which is something i haven't done since i was young. as you can imagine, they weren't too pleased (my sister, 13, slept in her closet even when i said she could take the bed). when i told them i wanted to be sleeping in their rooms bc of my anxiety and that i was practically begging them to let me stay, they said that they don't care and that my anxiety isn't their problem. i'm attempting to sleep in my own room tonight but i can already feel my Nightly Panic setting in.

i always thought that i could be one to manage my anxiety without extensive help but now it seems impossible. this past spring semester, i struggled so much in my classes bc instead of working on assignments i would spend all day at school and at home googling diseases and reddit threads (i clearly hate myself). more recently, i've even started watching vlogs of people who have certain diseases and their stories, thinking that i have/will end up being diagnosed in the same way they were. now that i'm out of school it's even worse bc i'm stuck at home all day.

my college offers free short-term mental health counseling for 3-5 weeks but i didn't take advantage of it until the last week of school so i couldn't get my full 5 weeks in. i talked with a counselor but i didn't touch upon my health anxiety bc i was so focused on my school stress. i recently was e-mailed by my college's case manager asking me if i wanted any additional resources outside of school. we had a phone consult yesterday and she brought up the option of finishing my 5 sessions possibly within the next few weeks on campus and more long-term therapy solutions. she asked me about my situation with my parents and i told her that it's likely that my mom won't be willing to drive me and that if i were to bring up getting therapy outside of school to them, they would not let insurance cover it. i have a friend (bless her heart) who said that she was willing to take me to the sessions if they were on fridays and i hope to god that they are bc at this point, i don't know what to do with myself.

it's really hard to believe that i'm gonna be okay or that nothing is wrong me (physically) especially when my family is so dismissive. i don't even know if i /know/ my body anymore or if the treatment plan for my GI issues i'm on is working or making things worse and treating something i didn't have in the first place (my anxiety is making me be inconsistent with it). am i making things worse? i admit i am very stubborn in my mindset so i'm constantly thinking about the ""what ifs"" and ""but this could happen"". i truly feel that i need someone else to hold me more accountable about getting better. i feel so stuck and the only thing that provides me with (fleeting) relief is seeking reassurance then i go right back to anxiety again. it's draining. i need help and i want help but i can't get it and i am really going through it oof. if my family won't take me seriously when i straight out tell them i'm scared to die, what's it gonna take? dealing with family members who are dismissive about mental health + (health) anxiety"

802,0,"As a high school student, college admissions are basically all my peers talk about. It’s easy to become obsessed with this topic, as it is the next step in our lives, but I have just realized something: all of these discussions have increased my anxiety to an unbearable amount, so much that it makes me lose motivation. However, the key to combatting this is to not compare myself to others (whether it be extracurriculars, test scores, or gpa) and to be content with my own passions and accomplishments. It seems as though both my peers and I have lost sight of the reason we attend school: to develop our passions and prepare ourselves for higher education. I have come to realize and accept that it isn’t the name of the college you get accepted to, but what you do at that college and how you accomplish your goals there. Despite pressure from both my peers and my parents to be accepted into the best school possible, focusing on my interests and some-what ignoring the chaotic fever dream that is college admissions has actually improved my performance in school and on tests.

803,0,"Hi, I’m new to this community. I’ve have sensory issues pretty much my whole life. I didn’t really understand what was going on until a couple of years ago, when I went to someone’s party and had an anxiety attack despite trying my best to have a good time. After some thinking, my parents and I thought back that when I was little, they’d take me to a father daughter dance every year and only one thing was constant- I went home every single year crying because the music was too loud, and I would say my stomach hurt, the older I got, out of embarrassment. I got and MRI to make sure nothing was wrong, since I have migraines as well, and everything came back normal. When I started getting older, I got more sensitive, and I hate being touched, loud noises, crowds, too many smells, just pretty much anything that affects the senses too much for me can send me into a massive anxiety attack. But here’s the issue: my parents don’t like to acknowledge that I have these issues, and sometimes straight up disrespect my requests for them to stop doing stuff that sets me off, or gets me uncomfortable. How can I convince them that it got worse since childhood? They don’t like to listen, but it’s so frustrating Talking with my parents on my sensory anxiety."

810,0,"Hello, I won't bore you with a big story but I'll briefly describe my situation.

I'm a very relaxed person, never been particularly anxious for longer than an hour or two.

I live in Britain and went to university last September, and my boyfriend of a year and a half decided in August that he was going to come with me.

I've never really been too bothered about people not liking me, I've worried about it, but only slightly like you would about being late for class. I started going to gigs with my brother and when I confessed I was shy and didn't know how to approach people he said ""oh yeah, people like us with social anxiety get that."" I started to assume, don't ask me why, that I then had social anxiety and was a delicate flower. I feel like this fuelled me then beginning to have moderate panic attacks when I thought someone didn't like me.

Whilst this was happening, my bf and I started having issues.

One thing I should mention, is that during freshers week, I tried mdma for the first time, and had a panic on the come up, but after standing outside I felt better. I also fainted in October because I was too hot and hungry in a stuffy club.

As October and November went by, the panic attacks got worse. I had one big one because I felt lightheaded and it reminded me of the two events above. And I had a huge one, to the point where I was throwing up in my toilet, because I thought I had meningitis because I had come down with a very nasty flu.

My boyfriend leaves me a week later and I have a panic attack the next day because I think I'm gonna faint. I have my first suicidal thought during that panic attack, which is fleeting and I dismiss it. I get agoraphobia after that panic attack, and only go to my studio and back out of fear of having another panic attack. But I'm not bothered, I'll go home in about two weeks, get therapy, get better, right?

After seeing two failed therapists, the panic attacks became worse, and more frequent. I had a panic attack every day, and lay in my mums bed one night, shaking, freaking the hell out because I was so scared about what was gonna happen to me. This was December, and I'd never felt this level of fear before.

I go back to uni after 4 long, anxious weeks, and hope to get better.

For some strange reason, my agoraphobia goes away pretty quickly, by March I'm going wherever I want, whenever I want, being like ""if I panic, I panic, I'll just sit down and wait for it to go away.""

However, the other aspect of my anxiety has become stronger, and has stuck with me ever since I had a huge suicidal thought in my mums bed that night.

Every day, I have a racing heart and thoughts that I wont get better, I'm gonna be anxious forever (leading to suicidal ideation). I get thoughts that after university, I'm gonna get a mediocre job and be depressed for the rest of my life. I worry that if something goes wrong, such as my housemates excluding me, or my anxiety getting worse like it was over Christmas, I won't be able to take it and will end my life. I also get general thoughts of people not liking me.

I'm awfully sorry about how dark this post is.

Since January, I have seen a counsellor, a mental health nurse, and went to group therapy. If my problems are so mild, then how come I lay in bed feeling like this is it? Feeling like I should end it?

I'm posting in the hopes that someone could shed some light on my situation, and give me some guidance because I obviously don't want to end it, I don't want to upset my family like that.

One last thing I should mention is that two of my older brothers also have anxiety, but they say mine is not as bad as theirs. Do I have an anxiety disorder? Will I get better?"

Yesterday as I was waiting for the scores to come back on my exam, I felt sick and wanted to vomit.

814,0,"I am 17, and while I did have a job, a hardware store for about 7 months, I am afraid of working. At first I just thought that I was lazy, but over time I realized that the responsibility terrified me. When I was working before at the hardware store, I would have no problem banging out a shift of doing simple work that I knew I could do right(stocking, cleaning, collecting stock numbers), and there wasn't much pressure to get it right in the moment. But when they put me on cashier duty, it was the opposite; there felt like there was so much pressure(relatively) to get it right - I had complete strangers relying on me to count correctly, hand their request, etc. in a timely manner. Once they put me up as a cashier, my days were numbered, it wasn't long after that I left. Now, I feel like this would be much more manageable at, say, a desk job, but I can't expect to go right into a desk job(obviously). a. This does not apply only to jobs but to any situation where somebody is relying on me for something(so favors, volunteering). I don't think it is a work ethic problem, either; as I said, if I know for a fact that I'm doing it right then I will very gladly work, but that anxiety with cashiering was enough to make me quit after having worked as a stockboy for like 5 months already. I really just don't know what to do in this situation, it's hard to express how much stress and anxiety builds up in these cases. I'm afraid of working."

just wanted to 'tell someone'.

&amp;#x200B;

we're having a home birth. First one didn't work out to well, all turned out fine but had to go to the hosptial via ambulance.

no complaints as it's all free in the UK but...we did have to wait 1.5 hrs for an ambulance, and it was all a bit intense when we got to hospital and baby eventually came out via forceps. 

&amp;#x200B;

We now have a beautiful, 3 yr old daughter. She's ace. Although somewhat disobedient at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year my wife miscarried twins, bit of a horror movie job - collapsed with loss of blood, had to call an ambulance whilst she was passed out in the bathroom. (50 min wait this time)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway - I was all fine at the time, honestly never been calmer - although had a weird 'come down' when it was all over a few weeks later.

&amp;#x200B;

Still feeling good during this pregnancy, then the midwife comes round about 3 weeks ago.

She was pretty young and seemed very nervous - she went through everything that could go wrong...

Since then I've been feeling really anxious.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's good to feel anxious now and again, if I know that it's due to a particular event and not a chronic issue that is.

&amp;#x200B;

I also know I'll get through it and just have to get on with it. I've been terrified before and performed well in MMA &amp; boxing fights, so I know it's just my mind preparing me.

Sometimes when my anxiety gets the best of me and I stress over something and that's something turns out not to be the case I feel terrible. Sorry if me wording is bad here's a story to explain better 

Yesterday I was playing on Xbox and my boyfriend had gotten on. I hadn't talk to him a couple days so I figured I'd invite him to a party. He doesn't answer any of my party invites. I sent four all spread out time wise because I didn't want to be annoying.

Around the third invite I started think he's angry with me there wasn't really a reason for him to be but rational thinking had left so I thought all sorts of things. After the 4th time I started to almost cry but I tried messaging him ask me if he wanted to talk and he said yes like normal. At that point I was confused so I message back if he had gotten any of my party invites and asked if I did something.
He said no to both and told me his Xbox has been acting funny. I felt so stupid after that 1) for thinking so lowly of him but he wouldn't tell me if he was upset with me and 2) that him being mad at me was my first train of thought. He then invited me to a party and we talked like normal me not bringing up what had happened earlier.

I'm honestly not sure what to do about these kind of thoughts, I felt crummy for the rest of the night and I didn't want mine bf thinking he had that something so I didn't say anything. That horrible feeling afterward"

827,0,"I believe I suffer from anxiety. But looking at posts from people commenting here and there, I realize that's not what happens to me.

Some people go on about irrational fears that occur as a result of anxiety. Example - going to sleep and thinking a bug is going to crawl in your ear, and fixating on that...

Holding your breath while crossing the street

Checking alarm clock constantly afraid it wont go off.

Another would be your airways closing up when sleeping and suffocating.

The often mention anxiety in the form of a fear of something rational or irrational, but still triggers fear.

My experience has been a little less derivative. I will all of a sudden have what I call an ""issue""

I feel elevated heart rate, almost tunnel vision type effect, real hard time focusing on anything, noises/lots of activity causes confusion and anger. A real strong urge to get the hell away from wherever I am.

A feeling of dread that i know is irrational, and i can recognize the episode for what it is, but still i have to push through it.

And 15mins later I am fine. Normal. When I am not having an issue, I can barely even comprehend the amount of fear/duress i am experiencing when I'm having an issue.

These issues can happen multiple times a day, or i can go weeks without having one.

Often they happen randomly, I could be sitting at home eating dinner with my family, and without warning BOOM.

But there are things that can often lead to an issue. Driving on a highway at high speeds, huge open areas with lots of people, are two things that ""can"" cause an issue to appear.

I say ""can"" because I have noticed a relation between these events and having an issue,but I am usually fine. I have no fear of these situations, and are in them regularly without problems.

The reason I call it anxiety, is because that's what my doctor called it.

First couple of times it happened I thought I was having a heart attack/seizure or something. So called ambulance, after many tests it wasn't heartattack/stroke/seizure.

So anxiety it is.

For a while this really put my life on hold, as I would often have to leave work midday because I couldn't handle these attacks.

Since then I have read a book called panick away, that walked a person through the process of facing such issues, and embracing them rather than trying to calm your way out of them. Mentally screaming BRING IT ON rather than internally visualizing yourself backing away from a cliff.

I have now had enough of these issues where I have recognized I am not dying, and always come out of it in 15 to 20 mins later fine. So my life can continue on, although knowing that an ""issue"" is always just around the corner, and I will fall down that hole again.

But like I have mentioned, what other people speak about with anxiety, is not what I suffer at all. I have no fear that causes it other than the feeling of terror itself.

Is this what anxiety is? It was named that years ago by my doctor and not addressed since.

I do not medicate for this at all

I am type 2 diabetic, well controlled with just metformin 2x a day. Numbers and a1c well in line.

I do also have a thyroid issue that I take synthroid for, but that has started after the issues started, and seems unaffected by.

Edit to add other symptoms

Real hard time keeping eye contact Ringing in ears Irritation to noises/incoming information Hypersensitive to internal bodily functions Like heartrate, am I breathing, am I shaking, am I cold, etc... Is this anxiety?"
828,0,"For context, I'm 22, and in the UK and I have a manual car

I took driving lessons when I turned 17, never rlly liked it, was pressured into it because everyone was doing it. Took test, failed, took it 6 months later, failed at last fucking roundabout. Felt like shit, (had never failed anything before)

Then I stopped driving for 4 years at uni. 

Had about.. .8 lessons randomly but didn't really get on with the teacher, got anxious,  given up.

Now not driving is starting to get in the way of opportunities. I'm a semi professional horserider- people have paid me to break horses etc - and not having a driving licence is making me have to turn down jobs- one thing is only 6 miles away but not having a car is making me unable to go.

829,0,"Anxiety is an odd duck and I find myself noticing more and more odd things it makes me do, outside of the usual ""symptoms"" or behaviors most anxious people are used to discussing.

It wasn't until recently I realized I hold my breath when I cross the street if cars are waiting for me to pass. It is completely impulsive and probably happens because I'm constantly worried about holding people up or being in the way, even in actual crosswalks.

Like above, my anxiety tries to keep me ""out of the way"" so I'm constantly walking routes that avoid the most people and traffic. I didn't realize it until I was walking with other people and felt awkward taking the busier sidewalks.

I'll get excited about visiting a new coffee shop or store but when I go to check it out sometimes I'll suddenly feel overwhelmed and casually walk by as if I never wanted to go there at all?

Upon first meeting someone I will smile and trade the usual hi-my-name-is, blah blah blah. But I can never recall what the other person says. I'm looking directly at them, nodding and smiling, and know they told me their name but my brain is buzzing with trying to act ""normal"" and seem relaxed that it doesn't absorb or retain that information. Same thing happens at the store or placing an order for something. I hear what someone is saying but it doesn't translate in my head because it's so full of anxiety jumping beans.

830,0,"Hey guys I’ve been on Zoloft for 4 months now. Initially it had helped reduce my anxiety and panic attacks a lot, but now at 4 months I’ve been feeling very numb, distant and zombied out. This has turned me into a very frustrated person, I’m constantly upset by how zombied out I feel and how I can’t “feel” anything. I hate how I cant find joy in music anymore, I can’t pay attention well anymore (podcasts, youtube videos), it’s like im completely brain dead. I dont know where I am mentally and its so frustrating.

So I’ve decided I want to lower my dose to 25mg. I was wondering what experiences anyone has had on going down a dose, how long did it take to stabilize? Im flying on a quick vacation in 5 days and wanted to know if I’d be stable on 25mg by then?

Thanks! Any and all advice, input is welcome and much appreciated! Lowering Zoloft from 50mg to 25mg?"

There's no way I'm backing down now, but I don't remember many other times I've had this much anxiety in a day. And to make it worse I know that it's dumb, and I just want it to stop.

It’s usually hard for me to make friends or even communicate with anyone without my heart beating rapidly and/or stuttering on every word. Sometimes I get too irritated because I know that’s it’s not the end of  the world but I can’t help feeling anxious about everything. I’m not sure when it started, I assumed it was due to emotional trauma when I was younger, but I thought maybe I would get over it. Little Things"
833,0,"So, my boss is super intimidating at work. She apparently means nothing in a harsh way yet it seems like she wants to end everyone over a small small thing done incorrectly. Everyone has told me not to be scared, but it's hard when she belittles you constantly and tells you to do something then something else. 

Here's the main issue. I have noticed my second paycheck was short by at least $60 and she scheduled me to work on a day I told her I can't. How do I approach it? Im scared I'll get fired. (I am currently looking for another job, but would like to stay until I know for sure I have been accepted) In order to (maybe not safely) quit I need to give two weeks notice and I would need to work two jobs and take classes part time.

834,0,"I dread going to social events with people I’m not as comfortable with. A friend I met through my work colleagues is having a birthday dinner at a restaurant tonight. I’m relieved that it’s there and not at her place. It makes it easier to leave after a couple of hours if we all have to eventually get up and go.

If this were with my regular circle of friends or family, I wouldn’t think as much of it. The birthday girl, though wonderful with good intentions, is generally controlling and opinionated by nature. My two work colleagues are close with one another and enjoy picking people apart behind their backs. I can only imagine that I’m no exception, so this lingers in the back of my head. I’m not close to the other two guests who are coming to the dinner. One of them sees me so sparingly, I sometimes have to re-introduce myself to her. The other was following me on Instagram briefly before she wasn’t anymore. Don’t know what happened there, but it happens and I don’t take it to heart. She’s still been pretty nice when I do see her in passing.

The dinner’s at 8 pm tonight and the very thought of it looms over me like a dark, brooding cloud. I’m out of the office today, and I was hoping to spend the day relaxing and oh, I don’t know...read a true crime novel and spend time with my kitten.

I clammed up the last time I was around these girls. They spent a good chunk of time talking about recycling and compost, then about local restaurants and shops they love. I didn’t have much to contribute, nor was I interested enough to ask questions about it. Didn’t say much but I felt like I had to. I felt like they would question me if I went on for too long without speaking. And I hate that. I hate the expectation of constant interaction because it’s draining. I hate that I’m condemned for opting out of it at times. Let’s face it - these social norms were built around the loudest voicing their expectations and the rest thinking that’s how it’s supposed to be.

Well...my rant (?) has gone on for too long. The point is, I don’t want to go to the dinner tonight but I understand that my friend’s birthday is important so I want to support her. But best believe that I’m already daydreaming about the ride home after it’s over. My friend’s birthday dinner is tonight and here goes my thought process. Round and round it goes."
835,0,I’ve always been super anxious about hanging out with her family. I’m not really around because I’m afraid and I’m going to say something stupid or they’ll get mad at me or something. We’ve been together for a year and it’s starting to put a strain on our relationship. Her parents got a beach house and invited us to stay for the weekend and I’m terrified. We leave in like 2 hours and I can’t even get up to pack. I can’t breathe and I feel like if I get up I’ll have a panic attack. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know why I’m posting this. I just needed to vent. I’m about to spend a weekend away with my girlfriend and her family and I’m so anxious.
836,0,"Hi all. I've recently decided to take the plunge and go see a GP in a few days due to concerns I've had with numbness and long-term loss of sensations. I was attributing it to poor diet, anxiety, stress, and other factors, but I've cleaned myself up some and it's still persisting, so I want to go get it professionally looked at. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I believe I had a panic attack yesterday. I have OCD and hypochondria and my mind went towards some dire diagnoses (including MS, ALS, all that wonderful stuff). I thought I was dying and could feel myself plummet into despair for a good while before getting a mental grip.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that that's said, I think I'm reeling from how worked up I got. I think it's the most agonized I've been in many, many years, and maybe even ever. I'm in a fairly dark headspace right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

My arms and legs feel useless. They feel that sickening adrenaline coursing through them - they feel weak and heavy, shaky and twitchy, fuzzy and tingly. My gait is kinda off, my balance feels weird, and my legs feel like iron. My hands barely feel like they can grip my fork to eat food (although I can, I'm not actually dropping my fork, it just feels way harder than it should be...) and using my mouse at my computer is a weird experience. It constantly feels like my hand is sliding off my mouse over and over, trying to push down feels laborious.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, is this normal? Is this degree of muscle weakness (I'm assuming it's perceived weakness since my grip is still fine according to my dad, I can lift things, and I haven't dropped anything or fell down) common with anxiety, especially after a panic attack/terrible day? I hate this, I feel functionless... lol

&amp;#x200B;

My hand (particularly my left hand) feels like it's sliding off my desk as I'm typing this. Why won't it just stay in place? Why does it feel like that? Annoying... Tell me I'm not alone (symptoms)"

838,0,"so ever since I was a kid, maybe since 5th grade?? whenever I would get anxiety, I would have to pee, go pee, and then... I have to pee again? and after that tinkles and tinkles. it’s so annoying because I don’t know when I have to actually pee NORMALLY or pee and STAY!! I’m on vacation right now and I’m stuck in this damned hotel room because of this. It’s not a UTI, for sure. it’s something weird, and it takes me a long time to take a deep breath and it goes away. even after I finally get off, it kinda lingers and I get really uncomfortable. sometimes I sit on my leg to suppress it and make it go away, as long as i I put pressure it seems to stop. It sucks, and i want it to stop. I remember my mom never believed me and thought I just wanted to get out of school so we only went to a doctor once, and they said they’d get back to us. never did, never have. I’m suffering from social anxiety and don’t take any meds for it currently, so if that has something to do with it please let me know. I want it to stop, I’ve had enough with sitting on the toilet for hours. I’m too young to go to a doctor by myself and my mom doesn’t really believe or care. it’s painful and irritating. i don’t always get it 24/7 but it’s still often enough to be horrible. we only have one bathroom in this hotel so, while everyone is asleep I assure you I’ll be getting a knock soon.

840,0,"So a couple months ago, my Bf and I (21) were having issues, but he got very last minute notice that he had to move out of his current housing situation, with really no where else to go with such little notice he moved in with me and my two roommates (m&amp;f 25). We have been great since then, but the weekend we had to move him we got into a pretty large fight. For a little background info I was working Tuesday-Friday at my primary job (40 hours a week) and then on the weekends I would work at my primary job 10a-2pm and then my second job either 7pm-7am or 11pm-7am. In between shifts I had to sleep, I would fall asleep during my job if I didn't. So it just so happens that my BF only has weekends off so he needed to move his things over the weekend, I had pleaded at him to try and get a couple of his friends to help, come to that Saturday he had no help so I had to help him. I picked him up @ 2:30 on Sat and we drove 40 minutes to pick up as much that would fit in my car, we went home and unloaded the car, I tried unsuccessfully to sleep and went to work an 8 hour shift. The next morning I got up went to work at 10am and then at 2:30 picked up my bf to grab the rest of his items because yet again there was no one to help him (or so I thought). We get home and unload the car and we started arguing about something, I was TIRED, HUNGRY, and EXHAUSTED. On top of that he was having a very heavy mental episode (he has depression and Bipolar). Instead of helping me put his things into his room he decided to play LOL instead, I just wanted to cuddle so I could fall asleep, which I believe started the argument. I felt it was not fair that I didn't get comforted to sleep before my shift later that night, especially since I spent my normal nap time helping him move. I had yelled at him while he was playing because he got angry at me for pestering for cuddles, I mentioned that I just wasted my time helping him and exhausting myself when I could have been sleeping. I then stated that I was the one who showed up for him, not his friends on LOL not any of his friends. ME. I yelled ""you have shitty friends"". After a little more of fighting, he started looking for his gun which I luckily hid before he could get to it. He wanted to kill himself, he then went on a walk, no shoes or anything. Came back a little while later, put on shoes and gloves, this time I followed him out of the house, he handed me his phone and keys and said take care of everything, I am going to jump off the telephone tower. After 40 minutes of me trying to convince him not to we saw an ambulance turn into my neighborhood. I started freaking out saying lets go because I thought someone had called an ambulance to get my BF. Once we got into my neighborhood we saw that it wasn't our house, things simmered down, my female roommate talked to him and talked to me and asked for this to not happen again. I tried again unsuccessfully to sleep before my shift. I went to work, I did my shift and drove home very tired. 2 minutes from my house, I fell asleep at the wheel and kissed a curb, cracking both of my wheels on the right side of my car and popping one of the tires. I called my male roommate to come get me. I left my car and went to sleep, finally after a full 48 hours of being awake. When I woke up I had no one else to help me at the moment so I asked my bf to drive me to my car, although we had the giant fight the day before he said yes. He drove me to my car, we realized the damage and I broke down finally, bawling on the side of the road after one of the worst weekends of my life. He said you must be hungry we are getting food. The next day I called his best friend for advise because the woman he was living with insisted that I call the cops and have my BF admitted for harm/potential harm to self, I really didn't think this was a good idea for him, he would have been angry at me forever but I wanted his Best Friends opinion. The best friend explained to me that all of his friends did offer to help him, but he shrugged it off and said he didn't need the help.  After this we started really working on our relationship, he realized that he needed to go get help for his Bipolar, this was probably the cause of the constant suicidal thoughts and many other issues he deals with. We have been happy, but I found out last night that while we had that argument his friends heard every single word I said. He didn't mute it. I called his friends shitty as a generalization and most friends he was online with I actually loved, they are usually very supportive and nice. I of course started crying upon hearing this news, I would never ever want them to feel like I felt that way about these particular friends. 6 people heard me say that about them, the first one was the best friend so I texted him and explained the situation and said I never meant for any of them to be hurt by what I said and I was sincerely sorry. I then found friends 2 &amp;3 on twitter and DM'd both of them explaining in different ways how I appropriated their support for my BF and that I never meant to hurt them, one of them hasn't read it and the other read it but didn't reply. Friend 4&amp;5 I don't really know, I don't even know their last names and can't seem to find them on social media. Friend 6 was really the only person I have ever had an issue with and that was established before I even met my BF. I have been thinking about this since I found out and I just can't stop. I feel so ashamed of myself. I want them to know how genuine and serious I am, I would have never said that about any of them except maybe friend 6. I guess I want to know what everyone thinks of how I handled this. What do I do? My Bf's friends can't all hate me. It kills me, it makes me so sad, I love all of them. They make him happy. Do I just wait it out? I don't know. I know I'm overthinking it but I have never cared for someone more than my current BF and yes our relationship has been hard thus far but there is so many reasons why and we have worked really hard to get where we are today. I don't want them all to hate me, I plan on being around for a while if BF will let me. Anxious about how my BF(21) friends view me after they overheard an argument"

I'm an INTJ - as an introvert I prioritize small, personal relationships over numerous casual relationships. Personally, I don't need to ""connect"" with a lot of people in order to feel happy. It takes a lot of energy for me to small-talk all day, and since I process information logically, I often can't connect with EF types.

The anxiety kicks in and tells me I need to be more outgoing and interested in other people's lives in order to feel satisfied. This could be in-person or online through social media. I also work in a building with over 100 people and while they are great, it can also be triggering to have to always be ""on"". Anxiety and Personality Type (Myers-Briggs)"

A whole month passes and things are going ""good"", each followed their own path and for my side I felt OK with it. But, there it is as always the cunt that my brain is saying bad shit about what I did and so on.

Some weeks pass and A states that meeting would be nice, agaisnt all recomendations I accept and go, talk things through and i'm happy because I dont really wanna loose A.

I am constantly being told that I have to work at my my brothers performance. My brother exceeded all of my bosses expectations. I am being held to a standard that I cannot get to. I am not my brother. Every time I talk to my boss he brings up my brother, which is starting to get annoying. I feel like expectations are set on me that are not attainable. I was given somebody to train with but he kind of left me without saying anything so someone else stepped in. I did not like this persons attitude. Throughout the night I had guests ask me for containers and I would just stand there frozen, unsure of what I was supposed to do. My brain just froze as it often does during socializing. I would be asking questions throughout the night about the work trying to show my interest in the job. Then it became time to close. My trainer did not bother telling me how they closed the restaurant at all and he just seemed to snap on me at the end. He told me that I have to show him that I really want to work here and I have to be the one to ask questions. As If I was not showing any interest? I was angry. I thought to myself who do you think that you are? He went on to tell me that he took it easy on me. I got angry again just typing this.   


Then we were setting up banquet tables with utensils and they had to be done a certain way. There was a total of 5 utensils and they wanted me to move at their pace. She told me that I should have all of the utensils with me and I should put all of the utensils by the same plate at the same time. I started putting down two utensils at a time per plate and got yelled at because I wasnt being fast enough. It was clear to me my coworkers had no patience with me. She asked me why I chose to do it my way after she told me how to set up all of the utensils on one plate all at the same time. Im slow but I told her I dont know why I did it my way.   


I held in my emotions until I got home where I just ran up to my room and I just started crying. Running past my parents.   


I just dont know what Im supposed to do career wise given my diagnosis. Im slow, Im not good with people, Im irritable, I dont like real physical work and I have a hard time getting along with others.

862,0,"Sorry my first post has to be like this. I just don't know whom else to turn to right now. 

Long story short (more or less): I tried to help my best friend to get her life back on track because I am worried like hell about her. Had a few serious talks with her (especially last weekend), staying as gentle as possible, offering help, trying to find strategies she is okay with, etc. etc. First I thought everything was fine cause she did do a few things I suggested. But she stopped writing me (we usually write daily, even over very small stuff) and stopped responding to me yesterday. Didn't go to our class today either, nor does she answer my messages (though I know she is online from time to time). Thinking about it, she does have some depressive tendencies, so I think I made everything just worse and possibly destroyed the trust she had in me. 

My mind is going wild right now. I don't know what to do. Part of me just wants to write her a long apologetic message or leave her something on her mailbox, other part of me thinks I have to give her space before I come off as controlling and clingy. I wish I had never started those stupid talks. I'm sorry if this breaks any rules or anything, but I just... I don't know.  Thanks for listening anyway. I messed up.

I have had anxiety all my life pretty much, and for the most part I can cope. I did take medication for a while but I’m off that. 

Recently I returned to grad school for a PhD. I started in my lab on Wednesday. I’ve been to this school before when I was a previous PhD student, but my professor left the university so I left with a masters. 

My commute is 1 hr and 20 minutes because my husband and i live in a house that we really like and live rent free there. He also works there. 

I started having panic attacks about this new lab work and going back for my PhD and the commute around 11am yesterday. Had another after work, and then another after I got home. Then I had one this morning. And had one during lunch. 

I’m so exhausted from these panic attacks. I have hidden them so I don’t think anyone (but my husband, I don’t hide from him) knows it’s going on. And I’m sure it’s the panic attacks but I really regret coming back to school and i want to immediately quit right now. I am really struggling pushing through. My husband says it’s the change and I’ll pull through but I’m really struggling. :( 

The panic attacks are mentally and physically exhausting. My whole body and brain hurts and I’m having a hard time picking up what’s going on in lab because of it :( New situation, panicking"
868,0,"I've basically been anxiety/stress sick for two weeks. At the beginning of June, my Dad and my Aunt got into a massive fight. It was a really complicated and messy situation, and the aftermath of it all made my anxiety go into overdrive. I've been nauseous, dizzy, shaky, lightheaded, tired, my heart bpm is up and I've got palpitations, and chest pain too. I've been better for the past few days, but last night I had a panic attack out of absolutely nowhere. Today, I feel ugh again.

I've been trying to distract myself, mostly with stupid 90s comedies (thanks Romy and Michele) and Taylor Swift playlists, but I'm still struggling. And it definitely doesn't help that my physical symptoms are kicking my health anxiety into high gear. It's hard to bounce back when you can't help but think you're terminally ill despite your doctor promising that you're perfectly okay.

At the time of taking medicines I was fairly fit and exercised. After starting Zoloft I gained about 45 pounds (10% increase in body fat) and even have stretch marks on my stomach for the first time. I have been exercising for about a month, Gained some muscle still hard to put off weight. Anyone have any tips to get rid of the fat I gained? Different types of diets maybe? I already exercise.

871,0,"Imagine if you carried around a little ape on your back. He holds a game controller that’s wired directly to your brain stem and clutches at the buttons with fervor, but does nothing. The ape rides all day, watching, waiting, prepared for the moment you enter confrontation, and finally when that moment arrives you lose all control and the ape grins with vindicated delight. What happens after this you don’t remember choosing to do, but you certainly remember doing it. 

It’s taken me my entire life to figure out how to get even a modicum of control over my fight or flight instinct. When I was a child I use to get in fights all the time. I’m not trying to brag as I’m rather ashamed of this, actually, but without any experience dealing with intense emotion I tended to swing first and regret second, especially when I saw the damage I could do. As a teenager and now as an adult, I have the strength to bite my tongue and stand my ground and I’m proud to report I’ve not been in a physical confrontation since 9th grade. (I’m 28 now.) 

However, the problem persists. The moment someone points a finger in my direction and so much as sneers my brain goes into overdrive trying to figure out why he is doing that and how best to destroy him when he comes over. Everything else gets shut out. It’s like someone flipped a switch and turned off all my higher brain functions and all that’s left is the ape, as if I’m facing down a saber cat and my life is at stake. When the adrenaline pumps my head begins to swim, my heart rate sky rockets, my muscles tense and I become hyper focused on this threat. All I can do is bite my tongue and stand my ground quietly for the duration, or run away. It becomes so difficult to think that I swear I could forget my own name. As you can guess I’ve probably done some pretty stupid things during moments like this, and I have... things I regret immensely that still hold me back to this day. Things that have wounded and scarred my body for life, things that I spend years going over again and again and wonder why I couldn’t stop it. 

I like to think I’m a smart person, and if you’ve read all the way down to here you might think so too- but I’ll try not to presume too much. During moments like this I would much prefer to calmly respond verbally to confrontations in an intelligent and indisputable manner, and when my brain isn’t confusing some cussing dude smoking a cigarette at the gas pump for a real threat, I usually can. I’ve tried breathing exercises, counting backwards, exercising (a lot), meditation, medication, CBD, and while these things help with general anxiety nothing can stop this ape from taking away my brain just because a stranger asks for money on the street, or a random number calls, or someone tilted in a video game starts screeching at me like some kind of meme.

I've been trying to eat healthy, sleep plenty, drink water, and even trying meditation to stave off these symptoms.

My symptoms include tension headaches, feelings of dizziness/shakiness (the most worrying symptom to me), general fogginess of the mind. I had a bit of chest tightness when it was at it's worst, but thankfully that's not an ongoing symptom. I worry that these symptoms may be something more serious than anxiety, but I also worry that it IS anxiety, which could take months of doctors, therapy, trying meds etc. to solve. I have an appointment with my primary care provider in about a week and a half, but it feels so far away.  I'm doing my best to hold it together, but being at work and being productive is really hard.

Is it normal to feel the symptoms of anxiety drag on for days on end? Do you have any ways that work for you to find relief from the physical symptoms? Long lasting physical symptoms of anxiety?"
878,0,"30 year old male. I have GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder), which I now can identify and point to triggers. For a long time I had a hard time understanding the physical symptoms (palmoplantar hyperhydrosis) and after a while I had success treating them, but the quality of my life didn't improve. This is mild anxiety (no chest pain, palpitations or panic attacks). However, it is present in all waking hours.   
By mistake, I have looked at a photograph of an acquaintance, who has a nice family and they are religious, and my gut reaction was ""Oh, it's such a shame something bad would happen to them, but there would be no guarantee that it wouldn't and if I were the father I would be the one to blame."" This reaction / thought often appears when I look at happy / wholesome families / couples. What I deducted from this is that my anxiety stems from the natural lack of control every one of us has. I can't be there all the time to defend my loved ones from a catastrophe happening. But that's not my main problem. I have been in dangerous situations and my loved ones were too, in either cases, I knew instinctively what is the right thing to do, and these situations were far less severe than I would have had imagine in my anxious mind.  
So what is this thought trying to tell me? What am I so afraid of if everything is in order? (Loving family, etc.) The possibility of it falling apart. Emotionally. Because it had happened once, in early life, I'm afraid it will happen again, but my mind projects it abstractly. It doesn't state: ""Hey, you will lose your family because you will stop loving them / your SO will stop loving you"",  but more generally ""Something bad will happen and your family will fall apart."" So I think that general anxiety is the fear of being rejected / abandoned so you will shut your emotions down in order to protect yourself. At least in my case. Others can have different reasons / sources for their anxiety. Take this as ""my two cents"". Anxiety derived from depression / emotional detachment?"
879,0,"CW: I mention suicide

There’s this friend of mine I’ve been crushing on for a while (I’ll call her Anna), and I ended up telling her as part of a dare for a card game. That night I messaged her and apologised for saying it in front of a bunch of our friends, and see said it was ok and that she liked me but that she didn’t want to be in a relationship at the moment. I took that as just trying to let me down lightly, and that she really wasn’t interested in me.

Long before all this, we’d started a running joke that we were in a relationship, but an incredibly dysfunctional where we always argued and never believed each other when we said we cared about each other. About a week before I told Anna I liked her, she kinda ended the joke by jokingly ‘friendzoning’ me, but then about a week after I told her I liked her, the joke came back, and this time it felt a bit more flirty, at least with the context that I liked her.

We went to a friend’s house at the beginning of this week and we all watched Schindler’s List, and she was resting her head on me and lying on me for most of the movie. I didn’t know what to think because I’ve never gone out with anyone before, nor ever really even told anyone I liked them, so I wasn’t sure if this was just a friend thing or not, but either way it made me doubt whether the initial message from her was as a flat a rejection as I had initially thought

The next day we went out with some friends and the vaguely flirty attitude continued, and the amount of physical contact between us increased a lot. This whole thing started to eat me up inside, especially after she told me during the day that I “make things awkward between us” but refused to tell me how. 

The next day we didn’t see each other and I spent the whole day in my house panicking and being depressed because I didn’t know what any of this meant. That was this Wednesday and it was the worst day I’ve had in a long time.

Yesterday, in order to prevent a repeat of that, I went into town on my own and just walked about for a few hours. It was pretty good and I actually got myself into a really good mood and I wasn’t too worried about it all. I went home and ended up talking to another friend who had given me some advice about all this. She told me I just needed to ask Anna upfront what the deal was, and eventually convinced me to. I was pretty anxious about doing this, but it was worsened by the fact that Anna was flying to America yesterday and I didn’t want to put the pressure on her if having to deal with my stupidity whilst she should be relaxing. My friend convinced me that it wasn’t a pressure and to just do it, so I drafted a message. 

When Anna landed, we started talking about unrelated stuff, just chatting and so on. After about an hour and a half/two hours of that, and a short break in the messages, I sent her the message.

“Hey, this is probably a bit of a weird message and I’m not all that confident about sending it but I kinda have to anyway because this has been getting to me and this is too long and weird anywAY. I just need to ask what the deal is between us because I feel like I’m getting mixed messages and it’s been kinda stressing me out. I thought your initial message on that Thursday was a flat rejection, but like nicely, but I don’t know if that’s what everything else afterwards has been saying. Stuff like at [friend’s house where we watched Schindler’s list]’s has made me doubt that and I kinda just need to know one way or another (and thats not to say like it made me uncomfortable or anything just I don’t really know what it means). This might just be me overthinking things and making things awkward, but what am I if not really good at doing that? :P if you need like time to think out a response to this or whatever, that’s cool, feel free to save it or screenshot it I guess? Whatever needs be. I guess this might be me making things awkward like you said on Tuesday, and I’m really sorry if it is, but this has been kinda stressing me out. Also if this looks like it’s weirdly written or whatever it’s because I drafted it like 3 times and i know I’m a nerd sorry”

This was all on snapchat so I don’t have the rest of the conversation saved, but essentially she just told me again that she liked me but didn’t want to be in a relationship because she didn’t think she could commit to one without making it implode, and she was worried about all the things that could go wrong. She said she wouldn’t mind if we did go out at some point, but for the moment, she valued our friendship too much to risk it, and apologised for sending mixed messages. She said if I needed some space from her for a bit that was ok. 

I responded saying that was all okay, and that I really just needed to know what all this meant and if anything had changed. I told her it was ok to stress about things like that a bit and not worry about it. I also said that I definitely do not want to stop talking to her at all. In an attempt to lighten the mood I guess, I joked that my shaking hands made playing vibrato on my guitar easier.

She said she was also shaking about it, and she was just worried she might hurt me, amongst other things that I don’t remember well, and ended by saying she would pull back a bit if I wanted her too.

I said she’d have to try really hard to hurt me, and that I value our friendship a lot too. I said I don’t want her to pull back at all unless she wants to, in which case absolutely do.

She responded saying, paraphrased, “ok, should we go back to being friends with not physically contact then?”

Here, I think, is the fuckup, I said if that’s what she wants, but I wouldn’t turn down a hug or a head rest, and that hugs are always nice. I meant it in a friend way, and I phrased it just like that but I don’t know if it came across. Her response was just “Okay”. I immediately responded with an apology, I’d already worried that the hug message was weird, and so I said I was sorry if it was weird and it was ok if she needed some space too. She said “it’s fine” and I said, “ok, I’m sorry for doing this too you”. She said, “it’s fine, u/an_o_cuin, I just don’t know where my head is at atm”. I said, “ok, I hope it gets better.” She opened it but didn’t respond after that. 

I had a panic attack after this, because I was worried her short responses and my weird message meant I’d fucked our friendship up.

Meanwhile on our friend group’s group chat, a joke conversation had started about whether all animals were cute or not, and Anna had got involved whilst she had been talking to me. After we stopped talking I started to try to get involved in the conversation, but no one really responded to the things I said. A few did, but Anna didn’t directly respond to me once, and I really felt like she was ignoring me or deliberately avoiding talking to me. This terrified me, and my anxiety only got worse. After about 20 minutes she had to catch a connecting flight and so the conversation stopped. I went to bed after that because I didn’t know how else to deal with what I was feeling (which was at this point suicidal, I know how stupid that sounds but when I spiral I really fucking spiral). 

I woke up a few times during the night, and checked if I had got any messages from Anna. I hadn’t, but she had sent a few messages to the group chat. That leads us up to know. I presume she’s asleep because it’s probably only about 5-6 in the morning where she is. I’m still really scared I’ve fucked out friendship up and I’m teetering on the edge of suicidal again. I don’t know what to do. This was more of a rant to get this off my chest, and I’m sorry if that breaks any rules or anything I just needed to talk about it. Thank you for reading it.

I have recently graduated from music college. I am an aspiring composer, but I also play guitar and have performed in pubs/clubs in the past. My main area of interest lies in composition for video games and trailers/corporate use.

Due to the ongoing anxiety, I find it difficult to apply for work which involves public interaction, office/workplace based jobs. Given that these jobs are very common work environments, I feel quite stuck in terms of finding work and earning a living.

Wondered if anyone had the same thing as me... I’ve struggled with what I call chronic blushing for so many years. It’s basically where my neck and chin and ears go very blotchy and red and make me look “embarrassed” I get this from any emotion or if I’m nervous. I’m starting to wonder if it’s a anxiety thing? And I think because I know it’s going to happen it’s worse... 

Even when I don’t feel embarrassed i go so blotchy people look at me like there’s something wrong and it knocks my confidence so much to the point where I avoid situations where I know it’s going to happen. I’m happy to talk to anyone but if it’s a stranger blotchy. In a meeting - blotchy. Happy - blotchy, angry at someone - blotchy. If I’m the centre of something/attention - blotchy (even around family?!) 

I’m getting married next year and my biggest fear is it happening when I walk down the isle. 
Has anyone experienced this or knows a way to stop it? I’ve tried breathing exercises, putting myself in situations on purpose, I’ve tried flower essence, antihistamine, aloe Vera... I’ve read online about beta blockers or surgery but I think that’s quite drastic?

I've recently started looking for work and it has become more and more apparent that I don't know if I have any ambitions, passions or motivations in my life. 

All I feel is a ever growing feeling of dread and dismay and I don't know why. 

My parents know this and tell me that all they want is for me to be happy whilst scolding me for spending to much time consuming media. (I play videogames around 2-8 h a day, the rest of the day I help cleaning the house or other errands they need me to do) I know that their intent is nice and they really do want what's best for me, I just don't they do/are able to understand. My dad is a little old fashioned and my mom usually end up having to defend me. (She works with high school students that have physical disabilities so she's usually very understanding and supportive)

These feelings have been in my life for the last 4 years and it's coming to a point that I don't know if I will be able to function if these feelings keep growing. 

I have friends but still feel alone, when I'm feeling happier I don't know if what I'm feeling is happiness or a substitute. Everything feels like a void, like everything is supressed or muffled.

I'm feel confused and I don't know if what I'm feeling is normal or not. I have not been diagnosed with anxiety and I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this type of post, I just felt like I had to get this of my chest. 

I guess I'm just confused, I don't know what feelings are supposed to feel like or how I'm supposed to navigate this vast world. 

I don't know why I feel like typing this, if it is to ask if I should get help or if that would just waste someone's time. The days feels like they're are flying by and I've lost control. I just want to stop and recollect myself.

Thanks for reading my post.

TL;DR 
Just me rambling about my feelings, nothing interesting or important. I'm confused"

I feel awful right now, I don't think I have a legitimate reason to be like this right now. I have had, of course, anxiety attacks in the past, but I could at least figure out what triggered it. I can't figure out what triggered this.

896,0," I drank a whole 1/5 last night and I was talking to my neighbor across the way (not usual for me) and just going on and on being like super talkative and telling him sorry if I wasn't social all the time, because I have anxiety issues and shit I wouldn't normally tell someone I don't know. Just going on and on about random shit. I also asked him if he knew where to find any weed, because he was literally smoking a joint at the time I talked to him and I could smell it, and he said he said all his connections were dry. Then at the end of our conversation, he said well I'm gonna take my high ass inside, I'll let you know if I find any. I'm pretty sure he was fucking with me. I got his phone number and gave him mine, but I deleted his number, because I feel like he's an asshole now. I also called my Mom and friend super drunk. I feel stupid and embarrassed as hell right now, and ashamed and I don't know how to deal with it. My neighbor basically made a fool of me, and I made a fool of myself. I'm going to not drink that much anymore obviously, but I don't know how to deal with this feeling of embarrassment and shame. Got drunk and made a fool of myself last night :("
897,0,"Hi everyone (again),

Just trying to convince myself that I don't have MS here. lol

 I had a very bad panic attack two weeks ago triggered by food choking  that left me with bruxism and tension in the digastric muscle (so, trouble swallowing and neck tension). It has since subsided a bit as I have alleviated my health anxiety,  getting several physicals to rule out thyroid problems... But last night as I got into bed I started feeling my right foot going numb and tingly. My right arm has been weak and tingly on and off since a few weeks ago as I started driving (a manual car) again after over a year of not driving, plus my posture at the computer, etc... but both sensations collided and I had a new panic attack, plus the throat tightness came rushing back. I took clonazepam and managed to sleep. My foot was not tingling in the morning but still feels a bit numb-ish. I took a long walk just now and it was working fine though.

I read a lot about anxiety and tingling sensation, but I wonder if it's usual to get it only on one side, and before or separate from an attack. And in any case, does it make sense to treat this stuff with physio even if it's anxiety-rooted?

Additionally, and this is perhaps more on account of my health anxiety, has anyone also dealt with this obsession to make sure what you have is not an autoimmune disease? And how have you gone about that? I don't have a family history of it but I struggle so much to make sense of random tensions and numbness  when I'm not feeling anxious (like when I'm trying to fall asleep, which is usually a time of relief for me). I have a box of Sertraline that I haven't started, as I'm afraid of the possible bruxism... anyways, feeling very run down and scared of my body. Right side numbness at bed time + how do you convince yourself you don't have MS"
898,0,"I decided to take a break from studying for the GRE to post this out there because this was a really big deal for me.

I really didn't know what to expect when going into my first session. It was interesting because I thought I was going to be talking about recent events that have occurred, but dang was I wrong. I immediately started talking about things that I thought weren't affecting me anymore, but obviously they still are. 

My therapist helped me in realizing that my thought process is just what us humans do and I should never think that my ""defense mechanism"" is wrong; it is just how I deal with things that I initially see things as a threat. 

She also opened my eyes with stating that,"" humans are made for connection"". I think that's why I overthink everything and make it so hard for me to let go of people, no matter how much they have hurt me. 

I just want to say that if you're looking into going to therapy for anxiety, or really for anything that's been bugging you, and you are a college student, see if your school offers free therapy! I always pushed therapy away because I wasn't ready to open up in that way yet, but mainly because of the price. My cousin mentioned free therapy through school, and surely enough my school offers it! You just have to be enrolled, doesn't matter if you're a full-time or part-time student. 

I made another appointment 2 weeks from now, and i'm already super excited to go back and talk about even more things! 

I always have to remind myself that it is never selfish to take care of myself and this was a major step step towards that! 

There are so many resources out there for you, you just gotta reach out and grab em, but only if you're truly ready! Went to My First Therapy Session Today!"
899,0,"My girlfriend suffers from anxiety and I don't know how can I help her when she is having an attack, most of the times I tried to comfort her but it doesn't seem to work very well. I try to not panic or not having control of the situation but it  breaks my heart watching her like that.

She also suffers from a mild depression and I really don't know what I can do to help, I try to comfort her but like with anxiety it doesn't seem to help.

We are both young 20 and 19.

I never dealt with someone like her ,  I need really advice to how I can help, because I love her so much and like I said I can't stand watching her like that. Girlfriend suffers from anxiety"
900,0,"Work/school has always been a huge stressor for me. With years of therapy, I've come a long way and no longer feel sick to my stomach about work, but I still break down at any hint of criticism. We're talking half-day crying spells after pretty standard negative feedback. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that it might have something to do with the fact that I never feel good enough or smart enough compared to my peers. I also also operate from a place of fearWhen I do get external praise, it buoys me for a while, but I clearly need a more solid foundation to avoid breaking down when I make a mistake.

901,0,"The last time I had serious anxiety, it was all about the fear and the breathing issues. I couldn't take five steps without needing to sit down and let it pass. I was too afraid to be any level of angry. 

This time around I'm almost permanently angry, with the occasional neutral or good mood. I must seem like a split personality. People look at me like I'm a demon. Things that I genuinely am upset about but don't really deserve a response now cause an 8 on the Richter scale. Things that shouldn't upset me at all make me stew for hours. 

Today has been an absolute nightmare and one angry mess from start to present. Like just a minute ago. My mother's the queen of \[often accidental\] misinformation and inserting her foot into her mouth. She said something to me that lit me up with rage, only for it to turn out to have been completely wrong and false anyway. She's ignoring me now, and even though I'm still mad, I'm now feeling pretty depressed about the whole thing too. 

People I love are getting more uncomfortable with talking to me. I really hate this. I don't even know what's happening until it's over - I don't even know how I find the energy to have this kind of anger because I'm always so deeply tired. 

Does anyone else get this? Are there ways to control it? I've never experienced being this constantly angry before and I'm worried that I'll ruin all of my relationships. Does anyone else have problems with being constantly irritable/angry?"

Then I got news from my mum that about 150,000 people from my country also didn't make it to uni.

903,0,"I´m writing this because i´m often surprised how little conversation there is about anxiety and alcohol. From my own personal experience there is a huge link between the two and this is something that should be being discussed more. Society is soaked in alcohol. We use it at just about every opportunity, to celebrate, commiserate and everything in between, yet the many problems that it causes are seldom discussed. We prefer to keep alcohol on it´s pedestal and bow down to it¨s supposed god like radiance, than to think about the potential it has for suffering. We are taught by our friends, family and popular culture that alcohol will help us with our problems and make everything more fun. Undoubtedly drinking with friends and family can seem to be great. Booze can help you to relax into social events, jokes become funnier, conversation easier and perhaps most important of all, everyone gets on the same level and are able to connect. But are we really enjoying ourselves as much as we think, or is it an illusion?

You may argue what´s wrong with an illusion that gives me happiness and good times with my friends. Surely that´s a good thing? Perhaps it´s healthy to drink sometimes, especially if you’ve been stressed out from work, or dealing with some difficult emotions. This is a good argument and may be true for many social drinkers, however in my experience, as someone who has had to deal with anxiety all my life, alcohol is a slippery slope that tends to exacerbate the very problems that we are trying to manage. So why not just enjoy the illusion? Well it comes down to one key word and that is ´acceptance´. 

I cannot stress enough the importance of this word in overcoming anxiety. It is fundamental to getting your head above water and until I came across the concept one day in John Kabatt Zinn´s classic ´Full Catastrophe Living´, my life was a full on ´catastrophe´ and anxiety was the one calling the shots. Without acceptance I would still be stuck in the anxiety trap and wouldn´t have been able to get anywhere near where I am today. Now here´s the thing, it´s not a popular message, but from my own personal experiences, acceptance of anxiety is hard to achieve if you are regularly drinking alcohol. As Jon says “unless we accept things as they are, we will try to force things to be as they are not and that can create an enormous amount of difficulty.” 

From what I have experienced with alcohol, if you are dealing with a significant anxiety problem, then you could benefit hugely from not drinking alcohol or at least, cutting right back (just my personal opinion, if this doesn’t apply to you, then please feel free to ignore). This is because alcohol is the opposite of acceptance. Instead of learning to deal with difficult emotions when they come up, when we drink we push them aside, we are in affect saying to them that they are not welcome, that we are unwilling to feel them. Unfortunately, as you may already be aware, when we are unwilling to experience difficult emotions, we end up getting more of them.

One of the major underlying reasons for my drinking was social connection. I craved it, especially as a teenager. Alcohol was a savior as i´d always felt awkward and shy growing up, but after my first sip of booze, I knew I had found something to deal with that. Suddenly I could be loud and funny (at least I thought so). Overtime I became reliant on alcohol in social settings and if I didn´t drink enough, then anxiety would take over. I learnt how to stay in the sweet spot and that meant I was drinking more and more. At no point was it out of control, but I didn´t like how it was making me feel after the buzz wore off and over time I noticed how alcohol was not actually making me feel as happy as I thought, in fact sometimes just the opposite. Looking back I can see that by not accepting my normal uneasiness and anxiety in social situations and self medicating with alcohol, I was making the anxiety worse, but at the time I couldn´t see that at all. 

I would always label myself as a ´normal´ drinker. I felt like I could take it or leave it, but over time I was definitely drinking more. Just this morning I walked into the communal area of my workplace to hear someone complaining about their lack of control with alcohol and how they are unable to just have just one drink. Often we talk like this as if we are surprised, but we shouldn´t be. As you know, alcohol is an addictive drug that hijacks your will power and over time often leads to people drinking more. If you have anxiety, then this effect is magnified. We tend to use alcohol to manage difficult feelings, but when the buzz has worn off the anxiety comes back, often worse than it was before. This can lead to a vicious cycle of drinking more to try and stay one step ahead of our negative feelings. So what is actually going on in the brain when we drink?

David Disalvo writes in his article: ´What alcohol really does to your brain´ that “Alcohol directly affects brain chemistry by altering levels of neurotransmitters - the chemical messengers that transmit the signals throughout the body that control thought processes, behavior and emotion”. There are different types of neurotransmitters, excitatory (fun) and inhibitory (fun killer). One example of an excitatory neurotransmitter is glutamate, which normally increases activity in the brain and leads to more energy. Alcohol suppresses glutamate, which results in the brain slowing down. An example of an inhibitory neurotransmitter is GABA, which reduces your energy levels and also slows things down. The combined effect of the suppression of glutamate and higher levels of GABA is the pleasurable feeling of drinking alcohol, a reduction in anxiety and relaxation. 

This all sounds great, but do we create problems for ourselves when we artificially alter our brain chemistry. David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College, London seems to think so. In the Gauradian Newspaper he states that “The body registers this new imbalance in brain chemicals and attempts to put things right. It is a little like when you eat a lot of sweets and your body goes into insulin-producing overdrive to get the blood sugar levels down to normal”. He goes on to argue that “When you are drunk, your body goes on a mission to bring Gaba levels down to normal and turn glutamate back up. When you stop drinking, therefore, you end up with unnaturally low Gaba function and a spike in glutamate – a situation that leads to anxiety.” This it seems is why we often feel anxiety with hangovers, or even a short time after finishing drinking. In addition to this alcohol also causes a rise in the fight or flight hormone noradrenaline “Severe anxiety” says Nutt, “can be considered a surge of noradrenaline in the brain.”

As we can already see, there is a lot going on in the brain when we drink alcohol which has a direct effect on our well-being and levels of anxiety. This effect can last for days after drinking and can even help us to get stuck in rumination. But there is one more important neurotransmitter affected by alcohol that we are yet to discuss and that is dopamine. Alcohol increases the direct release of dopamine in the brains reward centre. This reward centre is affected by all pleasurable activities, such as eating, socialsing, playing sports and drinking alcohol. But by artificially raising levels of dopamine through drinking, we trick our brains into thinking we are happy, so we end up drinking more to keep that feeling going. David Dasalvo, author of the previously mentioned article, argues “The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you're altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Over time the dopamine affect diminishes and the person must consume more and more alcohol to get the good feeling.” Sadly, for many this can lead to alcohol addiction. Even moderate drinkers would be wise to exercise caution, particularly if you have issues around anxiety. 

Is alcohol getting in the way of you learning to have a better relationship with anxiety? It certainly was for me and I can honestly say, that although sometimes its hard being alcohol free, it´s one of the best things i´ve done to learn to deal with anxiety. The hardest part is starting and the first month is difficult, but over time it definitely gets better and amazingly, you learn that it is possible to socialize without alcohol. Why not make a positive change today? If you suspect you have a serious problem with alcohol you should seek professional help, but if you feel your drinking is under control, but could be contributing to your anxiety, why not try taking a month off and seeing how you feel? Feel free to contact me on here if you would like to discuss how to go about this.

905,0,"I have been in a rough spot for the past three years and was living in California which required me to work three freaking jobs just to pay rent, then got evicted because I was unable to pay on time because of other bills that needed attention. I had been planning on going to a shelter until my coworker insisted I stay on a cot in his tiny dining room (bless that man). I have been called relentlessly and they have even contacted someone who was formerly my roommate TWO YEARS AGO about my debt. I have answered them before but they were less than compassionate and kept insisting I plan out monthly installments despite the fact that my income has already been stretched to the point where I was having to go to food banks and relying on the kindness of co-workers to bring me lunch every workday. I'm just so freaked out and I feel like I will never make a dent in these loans. It really doesn't help that I didn't want to go to college to begin with but my grandma forced me, and she got a loan out as a co-signer somehow and insisted that I go through with this college bullshit or else she would disown me. When the loan companies started harassing her I was feeling really guilty, especially about the fact that I had gone to college and majored in something I would never use and then she revealed to me (through manipulative behavior) that she had put me through that so I would have the income eventually to ""take care of her"" (read: drive her around places and do her groceries and basically be her chauffeur/butler because I owed it to her). When I finally said no to her (she wanted me to drive her home to Manhattan and I'm terrified of the aggressive drivers there) she made me out to be the most terrible person for denying her. After a few weeks she started developing signs of dementia which made me feel even more guilty, until several months later I had been giving her sympathy calls just about every few days. She had this new, slow, listless way of speaking and insisted that she didn't know me but that I sounded like ""a beautiful granddaughter,"" which made me feel absolutely torn up about everything that had occurred up til then...

...Until she didn't hang up the phone first one day and I quietly listened to her speak to my grandfather in HER NORMAL VOICE and I can't fucking believe she staged that entire thing to make me feel guilty and now I still have these debt collectors calling me like five times a day, which is a constant reminder of how she has basically manipulated me my entire life by threatening to withhold love if I didn't cater to all her demands.

Sorry that kind of exploded but yeah I am really terrified of having my wages garnished/tax returns withheld, especially because I am not employed right now but am actively looking and I don't know how much they'd actually take out from my potential paychecks which would make it hard for me to budget the rest of my other outstanding bills.

906,0,"I had to do a presentation with 4 other people about believing in yourself and learning from your mistakes in front of around 500 students aged 12-19 and the teachers...and ironically I failed. We had a pre-written script to follow and a Power Point (all done by me so I've memorised most of it) 

I told other people in my group that I had some anxiety problems (when it comes to public speaking) so they let me have the very last; shortest part of the presentation (which involved literally reading out loud 4 short sentences, a quote and saying ""does anyone have any questions?) 

The 4 girls (I'm a male) I was working with went through their parts flawlessly.

When it was my turn to speak I started out pretty well but then I suddenly mispronounced a word and had to read the second sentence again...after that happened I started to stumble on EVERY SINGLE word and my hands got so shaky that I couldn't hold the script - at that point I wasn't reading but mumbling and crying at the same time and after the fourth sentence I froze up and uttered some weird noises for about 20 seconds and passed over the script to a different person who finished the presentation for me. 

I could hear people laughing and making awful comments about me, and the teachers and the girls gave me looks of disgust and disappointment - I really don't want to go back there tomorrow.

I don't think I'm going to sleep tonight - it's 11:30pm right now. It happened 12 hours ago but it's still in my head and I'm constantly reliving through that dreadful experience. Froze up and started crying during my presentation"

Back at the end of April, I woke up having a severe panic attack. Throughout my life when I’ve had panic attacks, they’ve left my brain feeling very numb and disconnected. After a few weeks I’d typically come back down to earth.
This time, it’s lasted far longer. I’ve officially hit two months and my brain is just... numb. I can put my hand under scalding water, yet my brain won’t get that signal to tell me it’s hot and it take it out. I laugh but don’t feel real joy. I listen to a song and get the chills, but not in my head. I orgasm but I can’t feel it in my head. Some one scares me from around a corner, my body jumps, but I can’t feel it in my head. Every sensation I can feel doesn’t reach my head. My doctor said it could be a result of taking Celexa for so many years (recently had a medication change) and that flatness/numbness is a symptom of that. She said that my brain would resettle itself soon. Is this true? Is this all really because of anxiety or could there be something truly wrong with my brain? Very worried there’s something wrong with me."

910,0,"Last night was my end of highschool prom. I spent ages on my makeup and got my hair done and wore a beautiful navy blue satin dress and I thought I looked really nice and so did my boyfriend... 

When I got there, we had pictures taken etc etc... and looking back at those pictures I realised how damn much I hate my face. My face is really skinny (and kinda long??) and I have a big nose. I also have black black bangs that sit above my eyebrows. 

I. Looked. HIDEOUS. in those photos. 

All of the girls looked so nice and pretty and my hair just looked greasy and I looked like a dude in a dress. I was bloated (being skinny, it shows a lot) and my braces looked horrible on my face. 

I’m hoping as I grow up a little more and get them taken off my face will look better?? 

But as for my nose, there’s NO changing that. Although my boyfriend seems to love it, I want it smaller and cuter. I wish I could post all the photos with my friends on social media and stuff but I feel too insecure 😭 

TLDR: I looked hideous at prom and can’t think of a way to make myself look better other than plastic surgery.

913,0,"I hope that title makes sense, for the past three days I've woken up at 6am or earlier for no apparent reason, but while I'm trying to fall back asleep I realize I'm really scared and I can't sleep. 
The first night it happened (June 26) I woke up at 3 am first and realized I was supposed to call someone. I fell back asleep after that and woke up again at 6 and I got really scared and sad. I wanted to talk to someone but I don't want to wake anyone up or bother someone. 
The second night it happened (Yesterday, June 27) I don't think it happened for any particular reason. I woke up at 6 and sat around, my mom came home from work early so I sat with her but didn't really talk about it. 
Then today at 6 am it happened again. I had a really weird dream that was very dirty and corrupt and the entire dream didn't feel like a nightmare but made me extremely anxious. 
Please someone tell me how to fix this. I have summer school, I can't keep getting 5-7 hours of sleep every night, not to mention this is ruining the way I think. The anxiety doesn't just stop after I wake up, it keeps going throughout the day. Last night I was anxious while I was trying to fall asleep because my blanket was wet and cold. I've had anxiety before this and I hated it then, I resent it now. I've tried describing it to people but it's really hard. I feel such a strong sense of dread, like something is very very wrong and I just don't know it. 
As I type this my stomach is in knots, I feel so sick. I'm 16 I don't want to deal with this anymore. Right when I woke up today I wrote down everything that I could remember from the dream. It was really confusing but I feel like the written form doesn't do justice to how nauseating the whole thing was. Might do a seperate post on that to try and find meaning behind it, might draw a picture to better illustrate it. 
Thank you if you read this far. Please help. Thanks. I've been waking up at 6 am or earlier and can't fall back asleep because of throat closing anxiety"
914,0,"I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I’m really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I’d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn’t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn’t. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn’t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don’t, I’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

Just had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!

edit: thank you thank you thank you everyone for the kind words. it’s so awesome to be able to share this excitement with so many people! :) I will update once I hear back about the job. after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!"

917,0,"Hi, I don’t know if this is exactly anxiety but I don’t know how to define this feeling.

Whenever I state an opinion, about something I feel really anxious for about an hour.
I keep thinking if I said something wrong and If I should have just avoided talking about it.

This happens on the internet too.
If I comment on something I’m always afraid about the notifications.

It’s been worse lately and I keep overthinking about what other people could have thought about me.

I’ve been tell to not just worry about it but I really don’t know how. I’m scared whenever I state an opinion"
918,0,"So I’ve noticed that when my anxiety is in a peak state (near panic attack, but not in a panic attack) the way I take in my experiences gets extremely choppy, and I can only really remember small frames of a moment, rather than having it play smoothly in my brain. 

Like, in the moment it feels normal, but then just seconds later, it becomes this intense feeling of not actually knowing what happened. I’ll have just a super close up of someone’s face as part of it, even though they weren’t that close to me, or things seemed like they were super far away, even though they weren’t. And I just see stills of the memory that don’t feel real, it feels like I dreamt it. Even though it just happened 5 seconds before hand. And if I talk while in this state, I question whether I said anything at all, and find it very difficult to speak to begin with. It sometimes feels like the perspective of the scenario isn’t even coming from my own eyes, and there are massive black parts of the memory, where I don’t know what actually happened.

It makes me feel extremely out of place and like it is very obvious that I may be behaving strangely, because I feel like I am, but I can’t tell if I am or not

I find I do this as well with less anxiety provoking moments, like if I trip in public or do something sort of weird, I get this feeling, but it isn’t nearly as intense a feeling. Is this disassociation or something else?"

I took my last 25mg dose about 3 days ago and I’m having the worse withdrawal symptoms. It’s really difficult to explain how I feel but my body keeps jolting? Like weird body zaps..I’m not sure if this due to the serotonin I’m no longer getting from the tablets?

925,0,"I have been suffering from anxiety disorder for pretty much all my life around (31 years, and I don't count my first 6 years - as from what I remember I didn't have any troubling thoughts. I might be wrong, or just can't remember)  
Since I've been on an off SSRI's (anti-depressants) I can't tell if it works or whether it's perhaps a placebo affect. I've been reading this book from Edwin Fuller - The mind game - Witchdoctors an Psychiatrists when he criticizes that SSRI's don't work, and neither does psychotherapy. I haven't done much psychotherapy as such, perhaps 2 or 3 sessions. And I get the general idea that psychotherapy is not there to rid you of your troubles, but rather to provide you with better tools to understand your condition.   
In the Mindgame book this is how E Fuller also puts it - and he compares witchdocters with psychotherapists, not to be disingenuous towards psychotherapy, but rather upgrade witchdocters to the same standard of modern science.  


Sounds absurd, and I'm not totally convinced.   
Also Sam Harris from this interview he had on Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu - he doesn't discredit the use of medicine to combat depression/anxiety.   


Just wondering what anyone's thoughts would be on this. And perhaps link me to books/works/studies linked to how SSRI's are helpful with regards to anxiety.  


I'm also willing to give meditation a try, but my underlying issue is - my fears are irrational at it's core foundation, and I fear that using logic and rationality won't help me overcome the chemistry happening in my brain, because it's irrational to start with.

927,0,"Filed an official complaint against a dental hygienist's  inappropriate comments/ questions about my daily SNRI and use of other medications. 


I've been at this small dental clinic for 7 years, and they've frequently cycled through hygienists. This new gal made the most obnoxious comments about my medications and asked incredibly intrusive questions about lifestyle, despite my numerous attempts to evade them. She openly admitted multiple times that she doesn't believe in medications, and there were several other moments of unprofessional behavior that I was extremely affected by. 


She exclaimed ""So many medications!"" While updating my med list. I will admit that I take a number of meds right  now,  but i'm currently struggling the the symptoms of an unyet diagnosed autoimmune/autoinflammatory disease. But i've already been feeling badly about the handful of pills I take on a daily basis. 


While updating my problem list, I mentioned my GAD and she said ""have you ever tried breathing?"" I did that awkward uncomfortable chuckle one does while trying to avoid a  response, but she pressed the issue again. ""No i'm serious, have you ever tried breathing?"" 


Um. Duh. 16 years of therapy and care for my GAD means I was trying alternatives probable before she was even in school for dental hygiene. All I said  of course was that i'd struggled with the issue since I was a child. 


She said that she ""sees a naturopath and doesnt believe in medications"" which added to my growing discomfort.  Then she interrogated me about my diet. Literally asked me 4 times ""what are you eating? No really what are you eating? Do you just eat whatever without thinking about it? What are you eating then?"" I finally told her about how.my husband had recently started us on paleo diet, but then she interrogated me about how long we'd  been on it and potential trigger foods, despite my affirmation that i'd had allergy testing done in the past. (Intolerant to eggs, halibut and other white fish since we're on the subject, and according to her it's relevant information to non-medical professionals.)


More ranting but i'm tired of editing this story. We argued about how indeclined a comprehensive painful gum probing exam because my jaw /tongue was inflamed/painful just 36 hours prior due my systemic disease. She stomped off finally and got the dentist while I planned my exit, I would simply get up and walk out if they tried to force it on me. Luckily my dentist was cool and soothed me by saying we could skip it. She also ostensively disapproved of my conjectured plans to premedicate myself with pain and/or anxiety meds prior to the rescheduled procedure if I happened to be in the middle of another flare. 


It was the 3rd worst experience i've had in a dental office.
 

I would normally never say anything and would just transfer care, but I legitimately fear that she'll make other patients feel as badly as I did with her chairside manner. So, I put on my best administrative-bossbitch hat and wrote the dentist and his office manager, despite my fears of complicating our relationship.

I'm proud of myself for actually trying to stand up for those who need medicine to combat traumatic childhoods / chemical imbalances that cause significant impairment to daily life. No one should leave a dental hygiene appointment feeling persecuted for their regimen. I felt a little unjustified that I had to leave out my personal experiences in order to come off as professional,be taken more seriously and not be dismissed as oversensitive. 

I'm feeling anxiety about the issues she made me talk about, her reaction/demeanor during the discussion, and my fear of being written off as just a 'whiner.' However, no one should feel as negatively as I have for the 24hrs since my appointment. 

Hopefully I did a good enough job at explaining my perspective, offering constructive feedback and remaining as professional as possible. I lowkey hope that this will be an eye-opening experience for her. 

But honestly? Fuck her. Stepped out of my comfort zone today in an effort to help my fellow anxiety sufferers."

929,0,"I'm 29, I've suffered since my teens but only really admitted it to myself and put the anxiety label on it 4 years ago. For the most part I'd say it's been mild to moderate, suffering wise. But over the last year its been ramping up and have regularly felt myself increasingly close to the edge of full blown panic attacks. Since I admitted it I've taken big steps toward improving my life. I quit smoking, started exercising more, began meditating, sorted out my diet, started sleeping better, and for the past year I've been self medicating with St John's wort and sometimes cbd, among lots of other small things, too many to list here. Physically I'm a much healthier person than I was 4 years ago, but the anxiety seems to be getting worse. I've never told my doctor about it. Im from a big family and my older siblings and mum have all suffered terribly with anxiety, depression, OCD, one of my sisters literally could not leave her house for 18 months. So safe to say it runs in my family, I grew up watching them medicate for years with little success, so I think it's understandable I've put off the thoughts of medication til now, it's not that I wouldnt ever take it, but I have a bit more of a ""spiritual"" mindset than my family and have been trying to exhaust every possible avenue before taking medications that, in my siblings cases, have little/no effect, or could even make things worse.

TLDR;
So ultimately my question is, has anyone here had much success with anxiety medications? How long do you take them for, is it indefinitely? Do you stop taking them once you start to feel better? Are there any extra changes I can make to my life before going toward medications? Can medication work and is it my next step?"

931,0,"Help! My greatest physical symptom of anxiety is nausea, to the point of throwing up. Now when I encounter situations where it would be bad timing for me to get sick, I start to feel sick to the point of actually getting sick (anxiety people, you know what I'm talking about). My wedding is in a couple of weeks and I'm so worried about this.

I have dabbled with both beta blockers and Ativan and have still gotten sick on both of them; it's like my anxiety is so powerful it does not succumb to any drug. However, with the beta blockers I took them after the anxiety started (maybe I should have taken it before I knew I would get anxious?), and with the Ativan I had a drink with it (alcohol makes me anxious so perhaps it took away the effectiveness of the Ativan?).

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone else gets physically ill from their anxiety, and what do they take to help them calm down. It's very situational for me, so I'm not sure I'm ready to look into anti-depressants just yet. Any ideas would be awesome! Beta blockers or Benzos for nausea?"

We talked about starting me off with 10 mg of Prozac to help with not only the anxiety and some of the OCD but also my mood changes with the awful pms I have. She also mentioned a place about an hour from where I live that specialize in OCD and anxiety, she said this place really gets down to the roots of anxiety and OCD and that they really push exposure therapy. I feel like today was a HUGE push towards getting better! I’m highly considering going to this place and I’m feeling so motivated to help myself and get better!

935,0,"Hey guys, 

So I've been a mess lately, especially in the last couple weeks. I lost my appetite, desire to do things, so over a week ago, I went to the doctor's and she recommended me to go off Lexapro (which I was taking 20mg) and start Cymbalta. 

I have emetophobia (fear of vomiting/nausea), so the thought of going off one antidepressant and starting another made me feel anxious of withdrawals/side effects. 

For a week, I cut my Lexapro in half (10mg/day) and started taking 30 mg Cymbalta. I continued that for a week, and for the last 48 hours, I have taken no Lexapro (as per her instructions), and 60 mg Cymbalta. 

Been feeling the worst for the past couple weeks, but woke up and for the first time in a while, things don't seem to bad. I don't seem to be experiencing any withdrawal effects from the Lexapro, and the Cymbalta doesn't seem to be causing any weird side effects. I imagine I will feel better in another 6 days, when the Lexapro is completely out of my system and my body should be totally adjusted to the Cymbalta. 

A week ago, things seemed hopeless. Now I am thinking things won't be too bad. I'm a week free of xanax (was taking every day last week), and haven't had a panic attack since. 

Nausea levels decreasing, appetite improving, sleeping better, and getting more work done. 

If I can do it, you can too. We all know what it's like to suffer, and we all know how good it feels to be comfortable. 

Hope you guys keep a level mind today. Wishing you all the best. 48 hours off Lexapro... feeling okay"
936,0,"I’m 15, and I suspect that I’m suffering from OCD, while I have been professionally diagnosed with generalized anxiety. This post contains mentions of rape, murder, guns, and generally gruesome subjects.

Lately I’ve been suffering badly from intrusive thoughts. It seems like every couple of months, my intrusive thoughts will flare up again, and become awful. Last summer, I had intrusive thoughts about an incestual relationship with my cousin who I am closest to. When I was 10, I suffered from health-related intrusive thoughts that made me mentally break down multiple times. This was my first time suffering from intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors due to such thoughts and anxieties.

Now I am suffering from intrusive thoughts again, and they are mostly triggered by seeing scary things on the news, looking at something innocent, or going outside. I remember, for no reason, the day before I met my boyfriend, I saw something on the news about a young girl getting raped, and thus I had irrational and intrusive thoughts about being raped up until we met.

Whenever I go out, I always picture a bystander taking out a gun and shooting me. I get so scared and uneasy outside due to this. I avoid looking at scary news stories because it triggers my thoughts about being harmed by others or harming others myself. I can’t even look at small animals or babies because I get graphic intrusive thoughts about harming them.

It is honestly debilitating. Sometimes I’m unsure if I actually fear others or if I just fear my irrational and intrusive thoughts. I need advice on how to deal with these, what I can do to lessen them, and what type of therapy may help.

Thanks. My intrusive thoughts are killing me, what do I do?"

938,0,"A few months ago I posted about having too much anxiety to sleep after accidentally seeing a dead person in my job of cleaning at a funeral home (I work for several cleaning agencies and this was one of my postings. Woo, multi-shit-job student life!) To cut a long story short, I saw several dead people there, but that one I saw in a fully lit room. When I started that job I was to understand that seeing the deceased had absolutely no part of my job, I was just a cleaner.

After seeing a few more people I quit after having a major anxiety attack because someone left a door half-open which could literally mean anything about that room. Empty? Occupied? Who knew? It was a gamble and I wasn’t willing to risk it any longer. 

A few months later I’ve been getting recurring nightmares about the deceased. In these nightmares I don’t even see them like 95% of the time, but for some reason my home usually becomes attached to a funeral home and people like to leave doors open. And the smell of the mortuary that I can still smell in my dreams. Fuck, even the smell of the wood polish I used to use there. To put it into perspective of how much that place still haunts me, I used to really love the smell of that wood polish so I went to use it on another job, and the smell triggered a minor anxiety attack because I associate it with polishing the tables back in the home, which means potential dead people. Even the coffin emoji makes me uncomfortable now. Coffins in general make me very uncomfortable. 

I’ve essentially become scared of the dark again too. Or more accurately, I’m scared of rectangular objects in the dark. It’s nearly 2am here and it’s very dark and I need to sit up and put my light on but I kind of can’t right now because my desk is opposite my bed and although there’s precisely 0% chance of it being a coffin, even less, probably, but the voice in the back of my mind is screaming that it might be one. I’ll get there in time. But hey, this is the joy of waking up a sweaty mess from another fucking anxiety-inducing dream. Trying to remember how to count to eight in stupid breathing exercises to ground yourself. 

I’ve tried asking for help from people I know but their answers can usually be condensed into “lol”, so I don’t know what to do. I don’t remember the last time I properly slept. I don’t remember the time I didn’t dream of chapels of rest and half-open doors that make me want to scream.

Anyway, if anyone has any advice I’d appreciate it. Sorry for spelling mistakes and shit it’s like turned 2am now and I’m exhausted but too riled up to actually rest.

I'm doing pretty bad and it was clear to people around me that I had to see one. Now mental healthcare is really bad in my country and a lot of people went trough a lot of efford to finally get me a therapist.
I went a total of three times. The woman was very nice but it was not at all working for me, I felt like I was treated like a child and not taken seriously. She gave me some things to do at home like write down 3 things I liked about my day and she made me plan out my entire week. 
My anxiety was too bad to talk to her about it or ask her for a different approach so after the 3rd time I just sent her an E-mail saying it wasn't working for me and I wanted to stop the treatment. She E-mailed me back saying she would like anoter appointment to talk about it. That was the last thing I wanted so I declined, (again per mail) and she sent me a pretty salty E-mail back.
I realise this wasn't the best way to end it and now I have no therapy at all.
I told my family I was doing fine and don't need therapy because they went trough all the trouble and I feel super guilty about just quitting and I don't want them to go trough all of it again for me.

941,0,"Is anxiety just a pain that’s caused by something else that’s wrong?  Like a burning hand identifies a problem, rather than is itself one, maybe anxiety forms in the parts of us that we don’t see as special enough to Love and find comfort in.  Meaning if one sees someone else who’s popular and outgoing as special then we aren’t seeing that part of ourselves as special (hence why their approval is a super(temporary) boost to our sense of self.

This is possibly why we get social anxiety, have exaggerated fears, and panic - because we don’t see that part of us as good enough to protect us not worthy and strong enough to sooth us. Does anxiety show us where we don’t Love ourselves?"

Step two is not going to counseling or seeing a therapist, either. It is recognizing that many others have been in a similar position and have seen positive outcomes. 

When you acknowledge the two above points I encourage you to see a therapist, because after being hesitant for many years on the efficacy of therapy, after my preliminary session I can already feel a lot more ease and calm knowing that my issue can be addressed, will be addressed and that it has been addressed successfully through others before. 

I am excited, motivated and still a little anxious about it all (but that's fine, because anxiety is normal. It's what the overly-anxious do with that initial anxiety that makes things worse). So yeah, even though I was nervous all night, didn't get good sleep and anxious about my anxiety and panic attacks/mood disorder, I am rejuvenated and reinvigorated and THRILLED to push forward.

943,0,"**I didn't know where to post this, I tried** r/advice, **but they haven't responded in 40 minutes, and I am having an anxiety attack thinking about this**

I want to try to give away as little information as I possibly can, in case that anyone somehow figures out who I am in this post.

So, I attend a college, and I am part of this class (don't want to mention it). In this class, you spend a lot of time with 30-40 people. One of them was really friendly at first. But after that, I had a feeling in my gut that they didn't like me and hated me. It must be true, because this person constantly ""joked"" about stabbing me. Now I am afraid to go back to this class next semester because of him.

The first instance came after me and a few other students grabbed lunch together. I said something insensitive to him on accident, not realizing the way I came across. His response was that he will stab me, take my wallet, and donate the money to the poor.

Another time grabbing lunch, I made a remark to the other students about how we are basically a family at this point, and I heard one of the other students say ""we don't stab our family"". I know that he was talking about me.

This changed into actually pretending to stab me, and I am not sure if this can count as assault. I didn't take this as seriously as I should have. While we were side by side at one point, he pushed his hand into my side, closed-fist.

There was another time not long after that incident where he walked straight up to me grinning from ear to ear, and he pushed his hand into my stomach and back out, I asked him why he kept doing this, and he just stood there smiling, not saying anything.

Another time, he straight up told me that ""I was hoping that you'd die from that (not going to mention it here)"".

Through the grapevine, I know that this guy has some issues in his private life. I kind of shrugged it off as him joking, but upon recent reflection, I realize that this might be more serious than I realize. What if he actually does stab me? I unfortunately didn't get any audio/video footage of him doing these things. What should I do?

Also, I think I recall him ""joking"" about that to one or two other people before, but it seems like it was mostly about me. Last semester, someone at my college constantly made ""jokes"" about stabbing me, and I am scared to go back."

I am getting consistently negative feedback and I can feel the judgement rolling off of people. I hate being in the same room as people with the same job because all I can think is that they're being roped down by what an idiot I am. It's so frustrating to be around people who started working with me and they get glowing feedback and everyone wants them and I just fucking struggle to get to work on time. Sometimes it takes me two fucking hours to convince myself to get the fuck out of bed. It's like being a child, because clearly functioning adults don't have these problems. The only reason I go every day is because the terror of not going is even worse than the dread of going. 

I have memories through out my life of people going out of there way to remind me that I am not smart or am a waste of space. I had a professor say to my face ""Aren't you supposed to be smart?"" 

I know I'm an ungrateful brat. I'm employed, I have a place to live, I have food and water. And yet I'm always complaining. The more I live, the more I struggle to see why we bother. What positivity is there? You get older and you have more fucking problems. I feel like I'm drowning in nothing"
948,0,"So I have social anxiety and GAD. I'm also in nursing school, set to graduate next May. I've always had anxiety about what I'm supposed to do with my life, never feeling ""good enough"", struggling with presentations and feeling judged by others. This is especially difficult in nursing school because my clinical instructors are always watching/evaluating me (and my peers). Thankfully, by some miracle and a lot of effort, I've managed to pass so far, but lately I've found myself questioning it more...

Do I even *like* this? I feel I'm just doing this program to prove to myself that I can, when I don't even *want* to enter such a high-pressure, high-stress career. I know there are less stressful options away from the bedside, but usually it's necessary to have a couple years of experience working bedside before qualifying for these jobs. 

I love writing. I find peace in animals and the outdoors. I miss being myself and finding my creativity. I rarely even sing or laugh anymore because I'm so stressed and anxious about this career path. I feel I could do so many other things in life, but I wound up pursuing a career that I feel is taking my entire personality away.

I want to quit. I want to have a happier life and a more carefree career. I'm fine with challenging my anxiety, but this is just too much. However, I've put so much time and effort into this, and my anxiety about perfectionism and not wanting to ""feel like a quitter"" has kept me in this program so far...even though I've found almost no joy in forcing myself to be someone who I'm not. I hope that makes sense. 

Can anyone give me advice?

Edit: I forgot to mention this is a second degree/career for me. I have a bachelor's in creative writing, so while I do have a degree to fall back on, nursing is much more marketable I suppose Is a stressful career worth it?"
949,0,"Someone messaged me tonight saying they hope im better to my friends in the new im moving to,  than I was to my friends here. 

This hurt me a little.  

1. I have a hard time trusting people which is why I don't have many friends.  

2. Even when I do meet someone,i'm so awkward that no one wants to be my friend. 

3. I would much rather stay home and keep to myself than have to meet new people,  who may only use me or hurt me somehow. Which no one really wants, right?

I really don't know how to make or keep friends.

Any advice or suggestions? Anxiety, making friends and keeping them"
950,0,"Hello! It's my first time writing a post, so sorry if my explanations are not that good.

Long story short-had anxiety my whole life, got diagnosed with GAD the beginning of this year. I started seeing a therapist, everything went great, I truly felt like I was getting better. First semester of university ended, summer break started and I'm back to nothing. 

I'm having anxiety once again, but I have no idea what's causing it. In fact, it's 1:53 am right now and I can't sleep because of, you guessed it, my dear friend anxiety, for a third night in a row. It's gotten to the point where I feel absolutely awful: I'm worried all the time, I'm having freezing cold waves through my body, CONSTANT nausea. Not really sure what to do, the methods that helped me last time are no longer working.

Would love to hear some advice if you're going/went through something similar. Back to nothing"
951,0,"Yep. That’s your obligatory reassurance-seeking post of the day. I’m gonna be checked by a neurologist don’t worry, but in the meantime, please bear with me.... you know how anxiety is. Right now I’m obsessing on having epilepsy (but it’s a thought that has been coming and going around my head for quite some time). Here are the reasons why I might have epilepsy:
1. Suddenly I feel a sheer sense of anxiety,
I feel like my brain is sliding from my skull, like somebody or something is going to hit me and make me unconscious, like I’m about to lose control. I just FEEL I’m going to have a seizure, even if I don’t know if it is one of course. Confused and panicky as hell, I even get derealisation sometimes 
2. I’ve been dealing with muscle twitching since I was 13 (I’m 20 now) they are called “fasciculation”. They are apparently not the same kind of muscles movement you would get from a seizure but who knows, maybe there is a correlation of some kind 
Here are the reasons why I might not have epilepsy: 
1. I’m an anxious person. I think we kinda established that. I suffer from emetophobia and anxiety attacks related to this thing. Maybe there’s a deep-rooted fear of losing control. Sooo, is it possible that the feeling of “god I’m going to have a seizure I just sense it” is actually just an anxious thought? And I’m just experiencing a panic attack from fear of having a seizure? 
2. Muscle twitching, among other causes (yes I am paranoid of these too but that’s a different funny story), can be caused by, you guessed it, anxiety. 
3. I never had a brain injury, and, as far as I know, I don’t think epilepsy runs in my family. I don’t get any other symptoms of epilepsy, apart from the ones I have described above. 
(Number 3 is actually the only point that “kinda” reassure me but whatever) 

Congratulation if you read all of this mess, if I had been you, I would have skipped my own manic analysis straight away. So at the end of the day the question is: do you think I might have epilepsy? Can somebody with epilepsy relate to this? Or maybe someone who used to worry about epilepsy just like me and then found out that it was only anxiety?
Oh god Epilepsy or anxiety?"
952,0,"I'm not sure if what I have is anxiety, but lately I've been getting these waves that make it hard for me to breathe. They happen at random times, like when I'm just laying down on my bed. To stop them I have to stop everything I am doing and focus on my breathing until it ends.

And even when I'm not feeling that I have this constant feeling of dread, like I'm slowly losing control of my mind or already have. I've already asked my mum to book an appointment from a therapist, I'm just hoping this is just an anxiety disorder or something worse. Also every time I maybe catch a glimpse of something I immediately doubt myself whether or not I really saw it, and it makes me doubt everything. Does anyone experience this?"
953,0,"My health anxiety started when I was 21 just after I quit smoking.  I smoked for a little over one year from start to finish and have been so paranoid about my health for the last 4 and a half years.  I continuously worry all day about having or getting COPD or Lung Cancer.  I can't hold down a job because of it.  I recently also quit drinking, quit soda, quit fast food.  All I eat now is lean meats, fruits, veggies, whole grains, and water.  I am so paranoid about my lungs it's ridiculous. I have extreme health anxiety and have been to psychologists and psychiatrists and am on medication. Does anyone else have health anxiety here? How do you cope?"
954,0,"Just had a down in the dumps night , and this uneasy feeling is coming and it’s way familiar, it’s how both my other couple of obsessions started, being alone too long and thinking about things you shouldn’t think about for too long, don’t know how to keep myself occupied, and even if nothing comes I’m just starting to feel separate from the world, something feels impending. Only good thing  is I’ve got a lot on my mind, easy to shift attention. Had a real shitty night and I’m feeling the next wave coming on"
955,0,"so, a psychiatrist has prescribed me 10mg of prozac for the anxiety i’ve been having recently. at first i was happy to finally be getting the help i needed, but i just found out about serotonin syndrome and im terrified of it. i dont even know if i want to start the medicine now honestly. scared of serotonin syndrome."
956,0,"So as my title states I have been out of work since February 16th or so, and since that time I was using a credit card to buy stuff which amassed a large amount of debt (don't use a credit card if you don't have the cash). I didn't get a job until I got one at Lowe's but the position was too difficult so I had to quit, then for 2 or so weeks I put in applications everywhere. 

I eventually did get hired at a local dollar tree, but I got my hopes up too high. I checked out my credit card website to see how high my debt was and lets just say it was $ouch. 

And to tack on to all this I've been staying at an apartment I can't afford this entire time and got my landlady to agree to just evict me and call the debt settled so now I have to move back in with my grandma in like 5 days and its really stressful all of this. 

There is a silver lining to it all, I did get a girlfriend shortly after I quit that job I mentioned a few paragraphs ago. She's so sweet and I love her but in order to start our future together I needed a second job.

I got a call yesterday by a pizza place to come in for an interview and basically got hired on the spot, but now I have to manage the stress of two jobs and its literally killing me. Somebody hear my plea.

Tldr ; quit a shitty job in February got a girlfriend, couldn't find work, built debt, got kicked out of apartment, have to work two jobs to get rid of debt and find a new apartment with my girlfriend, stressed about it all. I have been out of work for some time and I am pretty stressed (explained better in text)"
957,0,"I was recently prescribed an SSRI and Ativan. I felt a panic attack coming on (huge, random headache), so I took 0.5mg for the first time.

Holy shit, boys. It might've been my biggest panic attack. As soon as I felt my body slow down, the old brain bag assumed I was dying; cue fun times and an almost ER trip.

Anyone else have this? Granted, my anxiety is strongly related to my health so any changes physically tend to bring panic but yeah, one of my worst. Anyone have Benzos trigger a panic attack?"
958,0,"Recently, my dreams have been extremely stressful, and when I wake up I’ve been having panic attacks. My anxiety has been through the roof recently, and I’m not sure why. I don’t know if my dreams directly correlate with the panic attacks, but I’m not sure what else it could be. Starting my day with a panic attack is awful because it causes me to be anxious all day which makes me not want to eat. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar, and if there was a way to help reduce it. 
Thanks! Waking up and having panic attacks?"
959,0,"I have never been on any kind of mood altering medication before and the idea of it scares me shitless. I think my anxiety is getting really bad and my parents said we should maybe go and get the medication for it but I don’t want to, Will it make me someone I am not? I don’t want to rely on medicine to turn me into a zombie so I can function without worry. I just got engaged and I don’t want my fiancé to see me as someone I’m not and I just don’t know about the whole thing. I don’t know what to do."
960,0,I’m going on vacation before I can see my doctor again and I need something to calm my nerves. I want to enjoy time with my family and relax without having anxiety. There must be something that will help! I’ll take anything it can be anything I just need advice Please I need a supplement for anxiety!
961,0,"I can't remember who posted the suggestion and on what post..but thank you so much for bringing Albert Ellis to my life! I've been listening to an audiobook of his someone uploaded to YouTube, How to Control Your Anxiety Before it Controls You, every chance I can get for the past week or so and I can see a change in myself already! 

Not saying my anxiety has gone away of course, but I was able to get through my 2nd day on a new job (today) without having an anxiety attack - like I did on my 1st day. With lots practice I have faith that I can keep this beast at bay or at least tolerate it..and I hope that you all find something that helps you in that regard as well :) Thank you to the Redditor that suggested looking up Albert Ellis!"
962,0,"And afterwards, even a day later, it makes you fearful of going back to sleep?

I havent had anxiety attack in a while but yesterday had a really bad dream which triggered one in my sleep, the effects linger when im awake. Now im kinda scared to go to sleep Does anyone get anxiety attacks in their sleep?"
963,0,"Hello, I've been dealing with anxiety most of my life, I have absolutely no idea why. None. Sometimes it goes away for periods of days or sometimes weeks, but always returns. I don't even have anything in my life to stress me out so much, I have no idea why anxiety attacks and the thought of having an attack is so debilitating to me. 
Lately its been a bit worse then usual. I feel a bit of disconnect from friends or family because they don't really understand. 
""Just relax?"" 
""What's stressing you out? Just fix it."". 
""Just don't think about it.""
I been roaming reddit a few months and it finally dawned on me to check to see if there is any subreddits with others who might be the same, scrolling around make me feel a bit better knowing I'm not alone, but also makes me incredibly sad to see that others feel this same dread. 
I typically try to distract myself so I can temporarily relax and not think about my own breathing (the more I hope I don't hyperventilate, the more I eventually do.) But it's so hard. To sleep, to do small chores, to go to work, to eat, to do anything where you can't completely immerse youself into mentally to distract youself. 
I know it's a crazy thought, but sometimes i wish something was physically/medically wrong with me, so I could have an answer as to why I feel this. So I could have a treatment plan that I know will forsure help. 
It's such a helpless feeling knowing it's not something you can see or touch or have someone else just fix you, it's not a condition you can just take care of and be done and over with forever. That it's something going on in your head, I feel completely responsible and helpless sometimes..

Sorry for the rant, I'm obviously new to this subreddit and I've been very emotional lately, so I'm looking forward to relating to most of you here, hopefully we can all help eachother and discover things within ourselves for a better tomorrow. 
Thank you. First time finding this subreddit.. glad to know I'm not alone but also very sad to see so many feel this horrible emotion too."
964,0,"I started a job a few weeks ago. I didn't get much specific instruction but a part of it is data entry and it is a lot like a job I did before. I am also working in shipping and I made a few mistakes but I wasn't yelled at or anything. I did get called out for one of them in a team meeting which was sort of uncomfortable. I am really really trying my best and have been told I was doing fine and even told them that if I was doing something wrong to please let me know right away. Today I didn't do shipping which was sort of odd but it was nice since I really am data entry. I just was at my computer plugging away at work. My boss came by my desk to say goodbye for the day and shook my hand and then said he had some stuff to go over with me tomorrow or Monday and asked if that works for me. I really haven't asked a ton of questions in the work as I'm pretty firmiliar with it and I have asked when I was not sure. The whole interaction was really weird and I can't help but think that I am really fucking up or that I am doing a bad job and they have not been saying anything. I feel like I have really been trying hard to do well and I still need to adjust to thing a little and get a flow down, which I see is starting to happen. I just really don't want to get fired. I have really been struggling with anxiety the past week and getting fired would just nail me big time. I'm trying to think positive about it but I just can't seem to stop thinking about it. I feel like I might get fired tomorrow. But I also feel like I am over thinking things."
965,0,"Hey everyone,

I've been struggling with anxiety for a couple years now and I'm really worried right now because I will soon be talking  more about it with my mom and doctor. My physician acknowledged that i have issues with anxiety, but when it was brought up I was still pretty young and did not completely understand what I could say or do to express my opinion on the way it was dealt with. So my doctor sent me home with some breathing exercises and gave my mom instructions on how to help with it a bit. It has gotten slightly better over the years (its been almost three now) with some help from my mom, but I still think that it could be greatly improved. My mom doesn't know the extent of it because I don't quite feel comfortable sharing it with her and haven't in the past. All she has seen is the general decrease in anxiety attacks. Although that is some improvement, with that decrease has come in increase in smaller less explosive attacks that generally do not cause me physically symptoms as my earlier attacks did but happen more frequently and over smaller things. In the past I did not feel comfortable sharing the things that i had worried about with them because I was pretty young and was not sure how to go about it I guess, Now that I see others, in friends, family and online getting treatment and speaking up about their issues it has encouraged me to finally talk about the full extent of my anxiety problems and push for getting help with it. Has this happened with anyone else? What can I do to make it less awkward and to make sure my voice is heard? I don't know but I'm really freaking out about talking about this with adults and I can't tell if its truly gotten better or if its just evolved into something new. Has anyone been in this situation that can share their advice with me? My doctor and mom are very supportive but I am still very nervous to talk about these kinds of things to them.

Thanks

PS this is my first post so I'm also gonna be freaking out about that :) I'm nervous to bring up with my doctor and mom the full extent of my anxiety"

I have my verification card/ticket printed from airport kiosk. I keep checking online but AA says my seat will be assigned upon check in but I thought I was checked in (checking in online and at kiosk) 
Do they mean wait until my group (I’m guessing group 9 - basic economy) lines up at the desk, hands over my ticket and when she gives me a receipt that’ll say the seat row and number? No one is at the desk to ask but I’d feel stupid asking anyway so I’ll do it here haha.

I’ve never boarded a plane by myself and when I’ve flown I’ve always had assigned seats. I’m nervous that’ll get to the front of the line and be told I should have another ticket (this one is flimsy like a receipt) different info with the assigned seat on it if that makes sense Silly but I’m boarding a plane by myself in 45 mins.

I also have this emotional numbness/anhedonia sort of thing but I think it is from traumatic panic attacks I've had in the past few months but idk could it be the SSRI?... the apathy I felt on SSRI was kind of different.

969,0,"I have realized my anxiety is so deeply rooted in my need for control and taking medication has always been a huge trigger for me because it makes me feel out of control. The suckiest part is that the medication works and helps! Yet my disease doesn’t want me to get better and will make up the most ridiculous lies to try to get me to put off taking it. It’s gabapentin and since it’s not like a normal AD and since I just started it I’m only taking it once in the morning and once at night. However most days since my anxiety is so bad in the morning I don’t work up enough courage until about noon. I am terrified of taking it on an empty stomach first thing in the AM in fear it will make me sick. I have emetophobia (fear of vomiting) but not once has it made me feel nauseous.

I guess I’m just looking for support from others that suffer with fear of taking medicine. And like I said the worst part is that it works once it hits me. So much less anxiety and no panic. I have just got to get the courage to stick to routinely taking it!

It’s like anxiety knows when I take it- it will die. So when the effects wear off it’s like my anxiety is like muahaha I got you! Let’s make you fear it so you won’t take it! Struggling with medication need support"
